Something that at first does not make any sense, but then, in some way, does make sense. After looking at the Next.js issue yesterday, I looked through our logs for other odd headers I may spot.

Having just looked at yet another middleware/HTTP header issue (the Next.js problem that became public this weekend) [1], I figured I should write something about HTTP headers.
