Eleven of those flaws earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, meaning malware or malcontents could exploit them with little to no interaction from Windows users.The zero-day flaw already seeing exploitation is CVE-2025-29824, a local elevation of privilege bug in the Windows  (CLFS) driver.  Microsoft rates it as “important,” but as  from  points out, risk-based prioritization warrants treating it as critical.This CLFS component of Windows is no stranger to Patch Tuesday: According to Tenable’s , since 2022 Microsoft has patched 32 CLFS vulnerabilities — averaging 10 per year — with six of them exploited in the wild. The last CLFS zero-day was patched in December 2024.Narang notes that while flaws allowing attackers to install arbitrary code are consistently top overall Patch Tuesday features, the data is reversed for zero-day exploitation.“For the past two years, elevation of privilege flaws have led the pack and, so far in 2025, account for over half of all zero-days exploited,” Narang wrote.Rapid7’s  warns that any Windows defenders responsible for an LDAP server — which means almost any organization with a non-trivial Microsoft footprint — should add  for the critical flaw CVE-2025-26663 to their to-do list.“With no privileges required, no need for user interaction, and code execution presumably in the context of the LDAP server itself, successful exploitation would be an attractive shortcut to any attacker,” Barnett said. “Anyone wondering if today is a re-run of December 2024  can take some small solace in the fact that the worst of the trio of LDAP critical RCEs published at the end of last year was likely easier to exploit than today’s example, since today’s CVE-2025-26663 requires that an attacker win a race condition. Despite that, Microsoft still expects that exploitation is more likely.”Among the critical updates Microsoft patched this month are remote code execution flaws in services (RDP), including CVE-2025-26671, CVE-2025-27480 and CVE-2025-27482; only the latter two are rated “critical,” and Microsoft marked both of them as “Exploitation More Likely.”Perhaps the most widespread vulnerabilities fixed this month were in web browsers. updated to fix 13 flaws this week, and fixed eight bugs, with possibly more updates coming later this week for .As it tends to do on Patch Tuesdays,  has released 12 updates resolving 54 security holes across a range of products, including , , , , , , , , , , and . users may need to patch as well. On March 31, Apple released a huge security update (more than three gigabytes in size) to fix issues in a range of their products, including at least one zero-day flaw.Earlier today, Microsoft included a note saying  security updates weren’t available but would be released as soon as possible. It appears from browsing askwoody.com that this snafu has since been rectified. Either way, if you run into complications applying any of these updates please leave a note about it in the comments below, because the chances are good that someone else had the same problem.As ever, please consider backing up your data and or devices prior to updating, which makes it far less complicated to undo a software update gone awry.

This has greatly expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes are made.This is the access that the Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon used to spy on Americans:The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that a Chinese government hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon broke into three of the largest U.S. internet providers, including AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon, to access systems they use for facilitating customer data to law enforcement and governments. The hacks reportedly may have resulted in the “vast collection of internet traffic”; from the telecom and internet giants. CNN and The Washington Post also confirmed the intrusions and that the U.S. government’s investigation is in its early stages.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Agentic AI in the SOC - Dawn of Autonomous Alert Triage</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/agentic-ai-in-soc-dawn-of-autonomous.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2dTrIpMbX1finqn_7GDhdQ9Jj_JM4Xe216Dy8sQOkCW0Z3LdESuxMf4ccvTau5MX07BS13vi3xD58EOCKWc2mgDhk_WcvI7im_BoOPBz88WlnvD8XYaGIJt0upXT1nAgzsGCgfWOl5_TOltULNt13xueCW2QQIl_MTzbZcNT0X1M5qS-xNshcQuCDgWQ/s1600/ai-soc.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security Operations Centers (SOCs) today face unprecedented alert volumes and increasingly sophisticated threats.

General Timothy Haugh.A couple of weeks ago, I wrote:We don’t know what pressure the Trump administration is using to make intelligence services fall into line, but it isn’t crazy to worry that the NSA might again start monitoring domestic communications.The NSA alreadyspiesonAmericans in a variety of ways. But that’s always been a sideline to its main mission: spying on the rest of the world. Once Trump replaces Haugh with a loyalist, the NSA’s vast surveillance apparatus can be refocused domestically.Giving that agency all those powers in the 1990s, in the 2000s after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and in the 2010s was always a mistake. I fear that we are about to learn how big a mistake it was.Here’s PGP creator Phil Zimmerman in 1996, spelling it out even more clearly:The Clinton Administration seems to be attempting to deploy and entrench a communications infrastructure that would deny the citizenry the ability to protect its privacy. This is unsettling because in a democracy, it is possible for bad people to occasionally get elected—sometimes very bad people. Normally, a well-functioning democracy has ways to remove these people from power. But the wrong technology infrastructure could allow such a future government to watch every move anyone makes to oppose it. It could very well be the last government we ever elect.When making public policy decisions about new technologies for the government, I think one should ask oneself which technologies would best strengthen the hand of a police state. Then, do not allow the government to deploy those technologies. This is simply a matter of good civic hygiene.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Security Theater: Vanity Metrics Keep You Busy - and Exposed</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/security-theater-vanity-metrics-keep.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgW739ZsG504NDXM8e7zn-Ls76Wa2qtns4L31PUp5mWPWY2cMyAv_DeW9uXp_eGxECLVWasiDVphK3HbfvvaenX-3Z8ZEgl6YBS1gKmiTJQz85WQFpOP-WZVv0SeemMj_27-HRLMY32Od8HnC8hbaTKJ6sfeSPEJCUpt7bKBPk1CM4MxWlVariVRs2yIfDG/s1600/cm-main.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After more than 25 years of mitigating risks, ensuring compliance, and building robust security programs for Fortune 500 companies, I’ve learned that looking busy isn’t the same as being secure.
