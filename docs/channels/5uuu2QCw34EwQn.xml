Protesters, some of whom have performed at the Kennedy Center in the past, asserted that drag is a form of art, and that supporters of drag are supporters of the arts.
 
The protest, co-organized by several D.C. local collectives, came just after Trump took over the Center, with his board appointees naming him chair and then firing its president, Deborah Rutter. 🔗 Tap the link to find out which former U.S. ambassador now serves as the Center's interim president. Gavino Garay was on the ground.

It was a big miss and any evidence that consumer resilience is cracking is a red flag, given they have been the backbone of US economic recovery from the pandemic era. 

This underscores the importance of tariffs as a catalyst for markets, as a lot of cost is expected to be passed on to consumers. Uncertainty over the timing and implementation of such levies is still up in the air. 

Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni explains why he remains bullish and says the Federal Reserve has "accomplished" its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Ed speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

He was elected a fellow of the UK’s national academy of sciences in 2018 as a result of his work and impact in the space and electric vehicle industries.However, the Royal Society is under mounting pressure to revoke the honour.In August, the Guardian revealed a number of fellows had written to the Royal Society expressing concern over Musk’s comments regarding unrest in the UK and calling for him to be stripped of his fellowship.Prof Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders at the University of Oxford, subsequently resigned her fellowship because of a lack of action by the Royal Society, with Andrew Millar, a professor of systems biology at the University of Edinburgh, following suit this week, as first reported by Research Professional News.More than 1,700 members of the international scientific community have signed an open letter to the president of the Royal Society, Sir Adrian Smith, with signatories including Bishop, Sir Richard Peto – an eminent statistician and Royal Society fellow – and Prof Susan Michie of UCL, a behavioural scientist who became a household name during the Covid pandemic.Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, said he was motivated to write the letter out of frustration at the organisation’s continued silence.“This isn’t an HR complaint about harassment or bullying or anything like that. This is a matter of behaviour that is entirely public,” he said. “Everybody can see what Musk has said and what he’s doing as head of Doge, and the Royal Society, which claims to have a strong voice for science within the UK, but actually, even on the international stage, has said absolutely nothing.”The letter notes the Royal Society was made aware of fellows’ concerns more than six months ago, and that since then Musk has made further incendiary comments.These include calling the MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”. Phillips has said the comments made her more worried about her safety.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry writes.The letter states the situation is rendered more serious because of Musk’s new position within a Trump administration that, Curry writes, “has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts”, noting that concerns have also been raised over censorship, particularly in the realm of climate scienceThe letter adds that the lack of comment by the Royal Society about Musk’s fellowship, other than its reiteration that concerns around individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence, “increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage”.Curry said he hopes the letter, as well as the recent resignations, would highlight to the Royal Society the breadth and depth of feeling within the scientific community about Musk’s fellowship.“If they believe at all in the values that they espouse in their code of conduct, then they really have to come out and explain to people why is it that they think that Musk’s behaviour is consistent with [them],” he said.The Guardian understands there is to be a meeting of the Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 March to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.A spokesperson for the Royal Society said: “In the event of any concerns raised about the behaviour of a fellow, the Society has a clear set of processes described in our code of conduct, which is published on our website along with relevant disciplinary regulations. Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.’’]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Says Reciprocal Tariffs Fair for Both US and India</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYpYTGqHBgI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uYpYTGqHBgI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:06:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump says reciprocal tariffs are fair for both the US and India during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House

"All I've got from intelligence is that he's preparing the war against Nato countries next year.""And, I think so, but I don't know... god bless we will stop this crazy guy and we will not have war in the world, in Europe - but you will not stop him just to say 'yes, we will stop', it is not enough." He added that "security guarantees" for Ukraine were the only way to stop future threats from Russia.Zelensky also claimed that a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead had damaged the containment shelter at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant overnight, which indicated Putin "is preparing to continue deceiving the world".He wrote on X: “Every night, Russia carries out such attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure and cities. Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric."This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations — he is preparing to continue deceiving the world. That is why there must be unified pressure from all who value life – pressure on the aggressor. Russia must be held accountable for its actions."Zelensky is due to meet US vice-president JD Vance in Munich, as well as US secretary of state Marco Rubio.Read more coverage from Yahoo's media partners below. Click the links to skip aheadA Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Kyiv region during the night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday.Radiation levels have not increased, Mr Zelensky and the UN atomic agency said. The drone strike damaged the structure and started a fire - which has been put out, Mr Zelensky added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later denied the claims.JD Vance has sparked a furious backlash for delivering an anti-immigration speech at the Munich Security Conference in which he attacked European leaders and backed those who voted for Brexit.The US vice president was accused of “hypocrisy” and his speech described as “bizarre and dangerous” as he departed from the usual defence focus of speeches at the conference to lash out at the UK and EU over migration and free speech.Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain is committed to Ukraine being on an “irreversible path” to joining Nato after the US appeared to rule out membership for the war-torn country.The Prime Minister bolstered his backing for Kyiv in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky as global leaders gather in Munich for a major security conference.Britain has so far sought to strike a delicate balance between supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and keeping Donald Trump, who says he has agreed with Vladimir Putin to start “negotiations” to end the conflict, on side.Royal Navy ships could be deployed to the Black Sea in a peace keeping mission to deter a new Russian attack, Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested.Ukraine’s president said 110,000 foreign troops might be needed to secure peace in Ukraine if Vladimir Putin agrees to end his three-year war.He outlined at the Munich Security Conference how Ukraine’s armed forces could protect the country if supplied with enough fighter jets and air defences.He also gave a broadbrush picture of how the West could help to protect Ukraine.Negotiations to end the war in Ukraine should not result in “peace that is a capitulation”, as this would be “bad news for everyone”, including the US, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.In an interview with the Financial Times, the French president endorsed Trump's position that it is Europe’s responsibility to ensure Ukraine’s security. “What Trump is saying to Europe is that it is up to you to carry the burden. And I say, it is up to us to take it on,” Macron said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>American troops in Europe are not ‘forever,’ US defense chief warns</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/america-military-presence-europe-not-forever-us-pete-hegseth-warns/</link><author>/u/EUstrongerthanUS</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:56:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian hostility and waning American support trigger broad agreement to boost defense spending — but 5 percent of GDP is too much for most European countries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Berlin says Vance should not interfere in German politics</title><link>https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/berlin-says-vance-should-not-interfere-in-german-politics</link><author>/u/Silly-avocatoe</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:32:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Musk will face consequences for interfering in German election, says front-runner Merz</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-will-face-consequences-interfering-german-election-front-runner-friedrich-merz/</link><author>/u/DomesticErrorist22</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:02:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Berlin wants more robust military spending following a bombshell move by the Trump administration to negotiate a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chernobyl radiation spread (old)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ip8qna/chernobyl_radiation_spread_old/</link><author>/u/RoyalChris</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:42:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>USA’s threats to invade Canada violate international law: Canadian ambassador - National</title><link>https://globalnews.ca/news/11011723/donald-trump-canada-greenland-threats/amp/</link><author>/u/HotPersimessage62</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:01:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Story continues below advertisement“I’m just saying that in order to respect international law, you don’t threaten your neighbors by invasion,” Stéphane Dion said.Trump has said he wouldn’t rule out using military force to take over Greenland, which is part of Denmark.In response to a question about Greenland, Dion said such threats are not normal and violate the UN Charter. He said that it’s not just against international law to invade another country but also to threaten to do so.Story continues below advertisementHe made the comments as Trudeau is in Paris to attend the global summit on artificial intelligence. Late Sunday evening following a dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trudeau did not answer reporters’ questions about the Trump’s statements.

				Dion said Canada and European countries are working on a cohesive strategy to address tariff threats from the United States.“Canada and Mexico are the first ones, but Europeans know that they may be targeted as well. We’re anticipating that. They are working with us about how can we have a cohesive way to convince the US administration that trade wars are painful for everyone… and not something that you should do between friends.”U.S. Vice President JD Vance is also in Paris for the AI Action Summit, but it’s not clear whether he will meet with Trudeau, as no meeting has been announced to date.Story continues below advertisementBoth Canada and Mexico were granted at least 30-day reprieves from the Trump’s broad-based tariff threat being realized just last week.On Wednesday, Trudeau will travel to Brussels to meet with E.U. leaders, which could offer Canada an opportunity to shore up its relationship with the European Union in the context of Trump’s threats.Dion told reporters Monday Canada won’t be successful in trade diversification unless that effort includes Europe.“Now that we see that unfortunately for now at least the U.S. administration is not as reliable as we thought, not respecting treaties as we thought, we need Europeans and Canadians to work very closely together,” Dion said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From D.

Jan Christian Kaack, the inspector of the German navy, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the damage involved "more than one unit."Kaack also said there had been attempted break-ins at German naval bases via land and sea, and he spoke of "attempts to approach" uniformed personnel while they were heading home.The vice admiral didn't give further details on the sabotage attempts or explicitly say who was behind them. But Kaack issued a general warning about Moscow while speaking with reporters."The growing threat from Russia is more urgent at the beginning of 2025 than it was two years ago," he said.Kaack's comments follow a report published on Monday by the local outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung, which said German police were investigating an incident at a Hamburg shipyard where several dozen kilograms of metal shavings were dumped into a corvette-class vessel's engine system.The joint report from the broadcasters WDR and NDR said the corvette was a brand-new ship called the "Emden" awaiting delivery to the German military. It's scheduled for deployment to the Baltic Sea, the outlets reported.Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote that if the shavings hadn't been detected during an inspection, they would have caused significant damage to the ship.At Tuesday's press conference, Kaack was asked to address Süddeutsche Zeitung's report, but he didn't directly confirm the Emden incident when speaking about sabotage.The Emden is one of the five new K130 corvettes that Germany ordered for delivery in 2025 to fulfill its NATO requirements.Naval Vessels Lürssen, the company responsible for building the ships in Hamburg, told Agence France-Presse that the Emden had recently completed a "successful sea trial."It didn't respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.A spokesperson for the German navy told BI that the incident was still under investigation."So far, the 'Emden' is under construction and, therefore, owned by the manufacturing shipbuilding company," the spokesperson wrote in an email.Germany is already on high alert for sabotage attempts after multiple incidents in the past two years that include a package catching fire on a plane and a fire at an ammunition factory in Berlin.German authorities have repeatedly suggested that Russia is the prime suspect but are still investigating many of these cases.Ukraine's allies have accused Russia of waging a "hybrid war" against the West, with reports of an attempted assassination against a defense contractor CEO and the growing assessment that Russia-linked oil tankers damaged undersea infrastructure cables in the Baltic Sea.The Russian government didn't respond to a request for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours.February 13, 2025: This story was updated to reflect a statement from the German navy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe warns against “dirty” Ukraine deal; Trump orders reciprocal tariffs, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/europe-warns-against-dirty-ukraine-deal-trump-orders-recipro</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/67aec547f7ed89241065bbd5/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk1MDY5NTY1MzUtYTlmNGUyZmQtMTBlZC00NWU4LTg2Y2UtOTQ5M2M0MWUxMzViLXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk1MDY5NjAzMzktN2I5NjdmNzMtNzE0YS00MDIyLThiYTEtMTRhNDU2OGQ2MWI5LXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=hXby-CeF0MYAwC4I01J3l3mixtaWKz77L84XbztT8EU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 04:23:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia asks Elon Musk to hand over names of dissidents</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/russia-elon-musk-list-names-dissidents-usaid-s798gktd7</link><author>/u/Infidel8</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 03:50:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Moscow has appealed to the US to identify exiled Russian opposition figures who received funding from America’s international aid agency, which Elon Musk described as a “criminal organisation”.President Trump’s move to freeze international assistance for 90 days and suspend the work of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) has devastated funding for Russian opposition media and human rights groups.
