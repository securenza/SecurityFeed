"Give us back the Statue of Liberty," centre-left politician Raphaël Glucksmann said at a convention of his Place Publique center-left movement."We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: 'Give us back the Statue of Liberty,'" he told cheering supporters.

While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out—the hit on the Druzhba pipeline—creating international ripple effects beyond Russia’s borders as exports suddenly dropped.As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine’s strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia’s air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.What followed was Russia’s most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city’s largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disruptedExplosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force’s rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.The Druzhba pipeline—one of the world’s largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day—is a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, called it an attack on their sovereignty.When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia’s hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia’s nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia’s monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country’s electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.Ukraine’s strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?If Russia does not accept a ceasefire—at least in the air—Ukraine can exert much more pressure on Russia’s energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow’s main refinery, which supplies half the city’s energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia’s economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire—at least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine., we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.You could close this page.

That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement. In the last parliamentary elections in 2022, a united front of anti-Fidesz candidates fell well short of Orbán’s party, which won over half of the popular vote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Finland turns down US request for eggs</title><link>https://yle.fi/a/74-20149786</link><author>/u/Beo1217</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 09:07:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A work by Ben Jennings for The i Paper</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jcgv2h/a_work_by_ben_jennings_for_the_i_paper/</link><author>/u/CorleoneBaloney</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:19:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>King Charles signals support for Canada as Trump talks annexation</title><link>https://toronto.citynews.ca/2025/03/15/king-charles-signalling-support-for-canada-as-trump-talks-annexation-royal-watchers/</link><author>/u/4920185</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:15:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A maple tree, a red dress and a ceremonial sword may seem like cold comfort for Canadians hoping to hear their head of state defend them against U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated pitches to annex their country.But royal watchers say King Charles is showing subtle support for Canada in the only way he can, given his politically neutral role.On Wednesday, the King presented a senior Canadian parliamentary officer, the Usher of the Black Rod, with a sword in a ceremony that appeared loaded with symbolism amid the Canada-U.S. trade war and Trump’s suggestions that the country become the 51st state.The meeting at Buckingham Palace came after the King wore Canadian military honours on his uniform, met with Canada’s prime minister and planted an Acer rubrum — otherwise known as a red maple — on the grounds of the palace to commemorate the late queen’s commitment to forest conservation.Some royal watchers believe Catherine, the Princess of Wales, also got into the pro-Canada act Monday when she wore a bright red dress and coat, along with white pearl jewelry, to mark Commonwealth Day. Ralph Goodale, Canada’s high commissioner to the United Kingdom, wrote on X that there was “no doubt” she was wearing “Canada’s colours.”“In diplomacy, symbols are important,” Goodale added.Nicolas Kenny, a history professor at Vancouver’s Simon Fraser University, believes that these symbolic acts — all taking place this month — amount to a deliberate move to highlight the relationship between Canada and the royals.“The British sovereign will make these symbols and nods to various countries that are associated with the Commonwealth at different times, but the close-together accumulation of these symbols in this moment is not coincidental,” he said in a phone interview.Kenny suggested the King’s gestures might be “a bit of compensation” after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment on Trump’s 51st state comments during a recent visit to the White House.However, Kenny said the King’s influence stops there, given the limits of his authority. “There’s no political authority by any means,” he said.Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal commentator, said the King is in the “delicate situation” of trying to balance the sometimes conflicting interests of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms.As monarch, he must be “above politics” and cannot act without the advice of his prime minister, and Starmer “is very focused on achieving a favourable trade relationship with the United States,” she said.There are signs, however, that the King is paying attention to world events. Former prime minister Justin Trudeau said he and the monarch had a meeting March 3 that centred on “Canada’s sovereign and independent future.”Similarly, the King held a 30-minute private audience with Usher of the Black Rod J. Greg Peters and Senate Speaker Raymonde Gagné after Wednesday’s ceremony, in a conversation that reportedly touched on “topics of great concern to all parties, both nationally and internationally.”Despite not being able to comment publicly, “a more subtle statement, such as choice of dress, publicity surrounding meetings, meetings with officials and public engagements … can remind the public that he is also King of Canada,” Harris said.She also suggested the King could wield a more subtle diplomatic role by “bring(ing) people together with a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds” for state visits and receptions.The Royal Family’s diplomatic clout was on display during Starmer’s Oval Office visit, when the president was presented with an envelope containing a letter from the King inviting Trump for a state visit, possibly to be held at Balmoral, the Royal Family’s Scottish castle and estate.Starmer noted that it was “unprecedented” for a president to get two such trips to the U.K. Trump was hosted by Queen Elizabeth in 2019, during his first term in office.Arthur Milnes, a political speechwriter and historian, also sees a role for the monarch as a “sounding board” for Canadian prime ministers. Queen Elizabeth and now her son, the King, both had a deep knowledge of diplomacy and history, and an absolute commitment to secrecy, he said.“You quickly discover — any prime minister will tell you — that you can discuss anything in your audiences with the King,” he said.In uncertain and tumultuous times, the King also serves as a symbol of stability — and a reminder of what separates Canada from the United States, he said.“Donald Trump might want to be the king, but Canada actually and always will have one,” Milnes said.This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 15, 2025.Morgan Lowrie, The Canadian Press]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s 200% Tariff on EU Wine, Alcohol: What Happens If It Goes Ahead?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlYX0VonjOQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XlYX0VonjOQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports would send some companies out of business, according to Ignacio Sanchez Recarte, Secretary General of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins, CEEV, which represents European wine companies.

Après une phase de tensions maximales, Américains et Ukrainiens ont renoué le dialogue cette semaine en proposant une trêve d'un mois, que la Russie n'a pas encore acceptée."C'est un moment de vérité parce que si la Russie ne s'engage pas sincèrement dans la paix", "le président Trump va durcir les sanctions et les représailles et donc on changera totalement de dynamique", a estimé Emmanuel Macron.Selon le chef de l'Etat français, "plusieurs pays européens, et d'ailleurs non européens, ont manifesté leur volonté de se joindre" à un éventuel envoi de troupes en Ukraine pour garantir un futur accord de paix avec la Russie. Il s'agirait de "quelques milliers d'hommes" par Etat, déployés "dans des points-clés, pour faire des programmes d'entraînement" et "montrer notre soutien dans la durée", a-t-il assuré. Jusqu'ici, Moscou s'oppose fermement à un tel déploiement."Les Ukrainiens ne peuvent en aucun cas faire des concessions territoriales et n'avoir aucune garantie de sécurité", a-t-il prévenu.S'agissant du renforcement massif de la défense acté par l'Union européenne la semaine dernière, il a expliqué avoir demandé aux industriels français de l'armement réunis vendredi à l'Elysée de "démarcher les Etats européens qui ont pris l'habitude d'acheter américain"."Ceux qui achètent (des missiles) Patriot, il faut leur proposer le SAM-T nouvelle génération franco-italien; ceux qui achètent du F35, il faut leur proposer du Rafale", a-t-il martelé. Il entend d'ailleurs "produire plus" de ces avions de chasse du groupe Dassault Aviation "plutôt que d'accélérer le programme d'avion du futur".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump launches strikes against Yemen&apos;s Houthis | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d89Hy4EjrbY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d89Hy4EjrbY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 22:53:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump launched military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis over the group's attacks on Red Sea shipping, warning ‘hell will rain down upon you.'
