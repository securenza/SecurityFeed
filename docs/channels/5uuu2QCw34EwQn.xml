But since Trump took office, his advisers haven’t publicly divulged many specifics about what they might offer to Putin.Ukrainians have “suffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly, and it’s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters last week. “But that’s the only way this is going to end to prevent more suffering.”A push by the US to formally recognize Crimea — which Russia invaded and illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — as Russian land would likely draw tremendous pushback from Europe as well as from Kyiv, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly resisted territorial concessions. The US, Ukraine, and much of the international community have recognized Crimea as Ukrainian, despite Russia’s occupation of the peninsula.At the same time, security experts have serious doubts about Ukrainian forces’ ability to retake Crimea through military means. Even Zelenskyy acknowledged last year that the territory could only be restored to Ukraine through diplomacy, something Russia is unlikely to agree to.Trump first floated the prospect of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory years before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While running for president in 2016 — and subsequently, during his first term — the president repeatedly said he’d “look at” whether the US would move to recognize it.“The people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” Trump said during a 2018 interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos. “And you have to look at that, also.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks Bounce, Treasury Yields Mixed | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EgYyRqnIlY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8EgYyRqnIlY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:37:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Alix Steel, Scarlet Fu, Emily Graffeo and Tim Stenovec.

The decision to send military personnel abroad will be made by the president but requires approval from the Verkhovna Rada, the country's parliament. Deployments will be subject to a formal request detailing the mission's objectives, troop numbers, weaponry, and the conditions of their stay abroad.Zelensky vetoed the bill in January and returned it to parliament with amendments clarifying the decision-making process and ensuring compliance with international law. Lawmakers approved the revised version in late February.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada&apos;s Carney Orders Review of Contract for US-made F-35 Fighter Jets</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24JoaRR46Ek</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/24JoaRR46Ek?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:04:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canada’s new Prime Minister Mark Carney ordered a review of the country’s contract with the US’s Lockheed Martin Corp for F-35 fighter jets, a new front in the dispute between the two sides in response to tariffs and expansionist rhetoric from President Donald Trump.

It  the “EU is evolving into a quasi-federal state, limiting national decision-making power” and is imposing “ideologically motivated policies on member states, without any mandate”. Under the plan, the EU would cease to function in its current guise, and would instead be renamed the European Community of Nations (ECN).Kenneth Haar, a researcher and campaigner at the transparency watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory, said it was “quite simply terrifying” to see the Heritage Foundation moving its attention to Europe.”“Most of the attacks made by the Trump presidency in recent weeks on civil rights, on migrants, on LGBTQ+ rights and more, can be traced back to Project 2025,” he said. “We should be worried about them building up ambitions and strength in Europe.”DeSmog can also reveal that the Heritage Foundation has been holding private meetings with European politicians in recent months, as the group attempts to forge new alliances on the continent.MCC and Ordo Iuris have ties to national-conservative political parties that have been hostile to the EU’s agenda in recent years – in particular the bloc’s attempts to institute climate reforms.Ordo Iuris has promoted an agenda often  by Poland’s hard-right Law and Justice party, which ruled the country from 2015 to 2023. The party was  of clamping down on democratic freedoms and the rights of minority groups while in power. Ordo Iuris itself has been  of “spearheading an effort to roll back women’s and LGBT rights”.MCC is directly backed by autocrat Viktor Orbán’s Hungarian government. The group is chaired by Orbán’s political director, Balázs Orbán, who : “It is our goal for Hungary to become an intellectual powerhouse, in which MCC plays a key role.”In 2020, MCC  more than $1.3 billion in Hungarian state funding, largely via a 10 percent stake in the country’s national oil company.MCC-Ordo Iuris document claims to support a reformed EU that “emphasises decentralisation, national interests, flexibility, deregulation, and a stronger role for member states.”The Heritage Foundation led the way in creating Project 2025, the 922-page guide to radically retrenching the U.S. government. The blueprint  Trump to “dismantle the administrative state”, reverse policies on climate action, slash restrictions on fossil fuel extraction, scrap state investment in renewable energy, and gut the Environmental Protection Agency.Many of these policies are being executed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has decimated several departments  the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), while several individuals with ties to Project 2025  in the new administration.The 11 March meeting also featured the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a Christian legal activist group that was  in 2022 for helping convince the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, the constitutional right to an abortion. The Southern Poverty Law Center legal advocacy group has  that the ADF should be deemed a “hate group because it has supported the idea that being LGBTQ+ should be a crime in the U.S. and abroad.”Project 2025  limiting reproductive rights, including further limiting access to abortions as well as access to contraceptives.The Heritage Foundation “seeks to steer America towards autocracy under Trump’s rule,” said Martin Schirdewan, a Member of European Parliament (MEP) for Die Linke and the co-chair of The Left group.“Since his election we have seen that they intend to follow through on those plans to the very end. We now know that the Heritage Foundation and their allies in Europe want to replicate that model here. We must protect our services, rights and liberties from these oligarchs at all costs.”Speaking at a side event during the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC) conference in London on 17 February, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts appeared to hint at the group’s new European focus – calling for closer collaboration between national-conservative politicians across the Western world.He claimed that when Trump and his vice president JD Vance “say America First, when they say they’re going to revitalise the spirit of America, that’s not at the expense of Europe. It’s not a zero sum game, which is what Brussels wants you to believe.”Roberts added that the Heritage Foundation would support “our friends from Europe” to “reclaim” their institutions.He claimed that supranational organisations like the EU, United Nations, and World Health Organisation “rob us of our individual sovereignty”.“This is all about reclaiming sovereignty, reclaiming the spirit, the sovereignty of each of our nation states,” he said. “And so I can speak for a lot of Americans here and certainly all of us from the Heritage Foundation… We’ve drawn a line in the sand and we’re ready to lead the world again.”Trump this week  $8 billion tariffs on EU goods, including a 25 percent tax on steel and aluminium, after  that European countries are “ripping off” the U.S. on trade. He has also accused the EU of being “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world”.The Heritage Foundation, MCC Brussels, and ADF were approached for comment. and  have faced a number of conflicts with the EU in recent years over their attempts to impose reactionary, anti-democratic policies.Viktor Orbán’s government has  political, media, and judicial freedoms in Hungary over recent years, and has  plans to “occupy” Brussels in order to shape its policies on migration, climate, and gender.The Hungarian autocrat is also an ally of Trump.  in March 2024, while hosting Orbán at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, Trump said: “There’s nobody that’s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orbán. He’s fantastic.”MCC, which  Orbán’s ideologies at home and abroad, is funded heavily by fossil fuel finance.In 2020, Orbán’s administration  MCC a 10 percent stake in Hungarian oil company MOL, a 10 percent stake in the pharmaceutical firm Gedeon Richter, plus $462 million in cash, and $9 million in property. In 2023, MCC received €50 million in dividends from MOL, a firm that receives 65 percent of its oil from Russia,  an investigation by German broadcaster ZDF.The group’s Brussels arm has  the EU to “ditch the net zero madness” and  to convene anti-green groups from across Europe over the past year. It recently  that one of its key campaigning objectives in 2025 was to help create “a Europe unshackled from environmentalism”, and has called for the introduction of an EU DOGE.“The European Parliament must take this threat seriously, including by closing lobbying loopholes,” said Nick Aiossa, director at Transparency International EU, “otherwise shady think tanks with anti-democratic agendas will be able to sway policy at will.”Meanwhile, Poland followed the lead of Hungary under its previous Law and Justice administration. Media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders  that, “During the eight years of rule by the Law and Justice party, the public media were turned into propaganda tools”.Before the party lost power in 2023, Human Rights Watch  that the Law and Justice administration undermined the “rule of law by strengthening its control over the judiciary and smearing journalists and human rights activists critical of the government”.In keeping with MCC, Ordo Iuris has been advocating for “structural reforms” of the EU for several years. In 2022, the group  it would work closely with MEPs who oppose the “further federalisation” of the EU and want to see the bloc returned to its “Christian roots”.A spokesperson for Ordo Iuris said that the group “is an independent foundation funded solely by private donors. It has never received public grants or subsidies and has no affiliation with any political party.”Heritage Foundation’s European MeetingsDeSmog can also reveal that the Heritage Foundation has been holding private meetings with European politicians in recent months.On 21 February, the group met with Hungarian MEP Ernö Schaller-Baross in Washington D.C. Schaller-Baross is a member of Orbán’s party Fidesz, which is part of the far-right Patriots for Europe group in European Parliament. He currently serves as a commissioner for the office of Viktor Orban, and formerly acted as Hungary’s deputy state secretary for international affairs from 2018 to 2021.The MEP seems to share many of the ideologies held by the groups gathered by the Heritage Foundation on 11 March.In an  in January with the pro-Orbán newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he called for “a viable European alternative to Brussels’s misguided policies.”“Our aim is to guide the European Union back to the path of common sense and offer effective, real solutions to the continent’s challenges,” he said – criticising the EU’s “economically harmful, extreme green policies”.On 19 and 20 January, the Heritage Foundation met with Czech MEP Filip Turek, who is also a member of the Patriots for Europe group.Turek was in Washington D.C. for Trump’s inauguration – one of  populist European politicians invited by the incoming president. Turek was also  with Musk during the trip.Like Musk, Turek has faced allegations over his use of Nazi gestures in the past. During the 2024 EU election campaign, several old photos of Turek were , including one in which he appeared to give a Nazi salute from a car, and one featuring a candlestick with a swastika. Turek  that he is a collector of Nazi artefacts, and also has a knife used by SS soldiers, but denied that he was a Nazi sympathiser – saying his gesture was “dark stupid humour”.Turek, a former professional racing driver, is a social media influencer who wants to “save” the combustion engine. He is also a climate science denier. The EU’s Green Deal “is one of the biggest scams in history,” Turek said in a  prior to his election in 2024. “It needs to be repealed, repealed, repealed.”“Are we in a time of climate crisis?” YouTuber Šimon Žd’ársky  Turek in an interview in March 2024. “No, we are not,” Filip Turek replied.“What we see in the European Parliament at the moment, is a love affair between traditional conservatives and the far-right,” said Kenneth Haar from Corporate Europe Observatory.“They command a majority, and they have already shown to be willing to use it to roll back democracy, climate policies, and environmental protection. They could change the face of the EU decisively in the coming years.”The sole responsibility for any content supported by the European Media and Information Fund lies with the author(s) and it may not necessarily reflect the positions of the EMIF and the Fund Partners, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the European University Institute.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Canada’s Mark Carney speaks after meeting with European leaders</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNUiglbjoc</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/meNUiglbjoc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 19:58:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney makes remarks in London, England, after meeting with British and French leaders on his first overseas visit amid tensions with the United States.

But since Trump took office, his advisers haven’t publicly divulged many specifics about what they might offer to Putin.Ukrainians have “suffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly, and it’s hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters last week. “But that’s the only way this is going to end to prevent more suffering.”A push by the US to formally recognize Crimea — which Russia invaded and illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — as Russian land would likely draw tremendous pushback from Europe as well as from Kyiv, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly resisted territorial concessions. The US, Ukraine, and much of the international community have recognized Crimea as Ukrainian, despite Russia’s occupation of the peninsula.At the same time, security experts have serious doubts about Ukrainian forces’ ability to retake Crimea through military means. Even Zelenskyy acknowledged last year that the territory could only be restored to Ukraine through diplomacy, something Russia is unlikely to agree to.Trump first floated the prospect of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory years before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While running for president in 2016 — and subsequently, during his first term — the president repeatedly said he’d “look at” whether the US would move to recognize it.“The people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,” Trump said during a 2018 interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos. “And you have to look at that, also.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Deports Alleged Venezuelan Gang Members to El Salvador #politics</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlmVOHr-y4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PmlmVOHr-y4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:47:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Robert McWhirter, a constitutional law and civil rights attorney, talked about President Trump's expulsion of hundreds of migrants and a brewing conflict with the courts.

The Paris-based club of 38 rich countries cut its outlook for most members and predicted the pace of global expansion to slow to 3.1% this year and 3% in 2026 as barriers restrain commerce and surging uncertainty holds back business investment and consumer spending.

Nations currently in the eye of the trade storm may see even sharper decelerations, with Canada’s growth rate tumbling to less than half the OECD’s December prediction, Mexico entering a recession, and the annual expansion in the US wilting to 1.6% next year — the weakest since 2011 aside from the initial Covid pandemic hit suffered in 2020.

MacroPolicy Perspectives founder and president Julia Coronado explains why the US Federal Reserve faces difficult near-term decisions and how uncertainty is being reflected in various corners of the market and geopolitical landscape. Julia speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

“Such a conversation is being prepared for Tuesday,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to the Interfax news service. He declined to comment further on the planned discussions.

Trump had first announced the call to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, saying there was “a very good chance” for a deal. “We are doing pretty well I think with Russia,” he said. “We’ll see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday.”

The US is pressing for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine has said it’s ready to accept. While Putin has said Russia is willing to consider a truce in principle, he has insisted on a number of conditions before he’ll commit to any halt to the invasion he started three years ago.

Julie Norman, University College London Associate Professor in Politics and International Relations, offers her expectations for Tuesday's talks and examines how Trump's foreign policy tactics have changed since his first term in office. Professor Norman speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

He wants solid support from allies.Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.Watch: Key moments on Mark Carney’s journey from banker to Canada's PM"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing," a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians – Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's "51st state".The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security – a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant "to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships".His itinerary is full of great symbolism too. Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed "the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British".So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour – Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to "reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty".Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top. But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a "Trump bump" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat."I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment," reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors. Many will be watching to see how Trump addresses Mark Carney - he recently referred to Canada's former prime minister as "Governor Trudeau".Canada's new top talker has been talking tough. A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. "Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves," Carney declared to rousing applause."Make no mistake, Canada will win."But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as "the greatest crisis of our lifetime". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate."The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries," he remarked. "Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way."Carney says he "looks forward" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his "deepest affection" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister. In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.Sir Keir has described Canada as "an ally, and a very important ally too". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the "shocking attacks" on its sovereignty.This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics – "to do something and be seen to be doing it".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Putin Responds to Trump&apos;s Plea to Spare Ukrainian Troops #war</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD0QfqkqjHA</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bD0QfqkqjHA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest on the war in Ukraine.

The poll explored public opinion on Canada’s relationships with foreign partners and specifically asked about general support for Canada becoming a member state of the EU.The results showed 46% expressed strong or somewhat supportive views for Canadian EU membership, while 29% were strongly or somewhat opposed, and 25% were unsure.A significant driver is economic pressure from the U.S., particularly regarding tariffs and the ongoing trade dispute.The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) already boosts Canada-EU trade — valued at $157.3 billion in 2023, according to international.gc.ca — and joining the EU could further secure access to a stable single market of 27 nations.The Abacus findings align with growing discussions about Canada’s international alliances amid tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada.According to Abacus, 24% of Canadians are open to the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S. This includes 6% who are absolutely in favour and 18% who are open to considering it, while 70% are absolutely against it.Speaking at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is, "the most European of non-European countries."The Abacus results contrast with a recent Leger poll indicating 86% of Canadians expressed pride in their country, an increase from 80% in November 2024.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#Nvidia CEO eyes next move to outlast current #AI boom #stocks #tech #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYLui9XXnk</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kNYLui9XXnk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:36:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nvidia’s high highs raise fears of a fall.

AFP-YonhapU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday expressed his desire to reestablish the relationship that he had with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his first term, boasting that he "got along great" with the reclusive leader and still has a "great" relationship with him.During a press availability, Trump made the remarks, describing the North Korean leader as a "nuclear power" with "a lot of nuclear weapons," as his administration is pursuing the goal of the "complete denuclearization" of North Korea."Well, I would," Trump said, responding to a reporter's question of whether he has a plan to reestablish the relationship he had under his first presidential mandate."I had a great relationship with Kim Jong-un (of) North Korea. If I wasn't elected, if Hillary got in, you would have had a nuclear war with North Korea," he added, as he sat next to North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House for talks.His remarks added to expectations that he would seek to revive his direct personal diplomacy with Kim, which led to three meetings between the two — the first in Singapore in June 2018, another in Hanoi in February 2019 and the other in the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom in June 2019.Days after his inauguration in January, Trump said he will reach out to Kim again, calling the ruler a "smart guy," though speculation persisted that Pyongyang's appetite for engagement with Washington might have lessened as it has relied on Moscow for food, fuel, military support and other help.Trump claimed he continues to maintain a good relationship with Kim."I have a great relationship with Kim Jong-un, and we'll see what happens," he said. "But certainly, he's a nuclear power."In this June 30, 2019, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, left, meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the North Korean side of the border at the village of Panmunjom in Demilitarized Zone. AP-YonhapIt is not the first time that he has depicted North Korea as a nuclear power — a term that U.S. officials had mostly refrained from publicly using given that the term could be construed as a U.S. recognition of Pyongyang's possession of nuclear weapons.Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, he used the term to refer to North Korea, spawning speculation about his intentions behind the nuclear power labeling. Speculation eased later as the White House said his administration is pursuing the complete denuclearization of North Korea.Highlighting his hope to bring down the number of nuclear weapons in the world, Trump pointed out North Korea's sizable nuclear arsenal."Kim Jong-un has a lot of nuclear weapons by the way ... a lot and others do also," he said. "You have India. You have Pakistan. You have others that have them."The president credited the first Trump administration with South Korea's successful hosting of the Olympics, where North Korea partook, apparently in reference to the PyeongChang Olympics held in February 2018."They (North Koreans) asked for a meeting. And then we met. And the meeting caused the Olympics, which was South Korea, to become a tremendous success," he said."Nobody was buying tickets for the Olympics because they didn't want to be nuked, and I met and not only did the Olympics become successful, but North Korea participated in the Olympics ... That was something that was an achievement of the Trump administration ... great achievement."It is unclear what meeting he referred to as his first summit with Kim took place in June 2018 months after the Olympics.

This breakthrough could significantly impact battlefield conditions if sustained, particularly considering potential policy changes under the Trump administration.Amid the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, Trump has alarmed European allies by appearing to shift toward Moscow after taking office in January. Russian glide bombs have caused numerous Ukrainian military and civilian casualties and played a decisive role in territorial gains by Kremlin forces, especially in 2024. However, their effectiveness appears to have diminished recently.Russian military bloggers with connections to the air force reported earlier that Ukrainian forces have successfully disrupted the control systems of these weapons. Glide bombs function as conventional aerial munitions upgraded with metal wings and satellite navigation, which increases both their range and accuracy. Their lack of a motor means they produce no heat signature, making them difficult for conventional air defense systems to detect and intercept, Der Spiegel notes. During flight, they can be controlled via satellite.How Ukraine disrupts Russian bombsWhile precise details of Ukraine’s countermeasures remain limited, military expert Thomas Withington from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) explained to Der Spiegel that satellite jamming is a likely method.“When a satellite signal reaches the earth, it is only very weak. If you generate a stronger signal at the same frequency near the receiver, it will mask the signal from space,” Withington told Der Spiegel.This interference allows defenders to redirect the bomb onto a new trajectory. Russian forces reportedly complain they now require many more bombs and sorties to achieve successful strikes, making missions increasingly impractical.Withington notes that countermeasures against such jamming do exist:“Western glide bombs, for example, use an encrypted GPS signal and therefore do not react to other signals.”Whether Russians lack this technology or Ukrainians have broken their encryption remains unclear. Russian forces generally use their own satellite navigation system called Glonass, but according to Withington, many frontline soldiers utilize simple, unencrypted receivers.Consistently disrupting glide bombs would further weaken Russia’s stalled advances. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air capabilities are advancing with Western support, as American F-16s and French Mirages gradually arrive, and Ukraine has been using US- and French-supplied glide bombs.However, Western equipment comes with limitations.“The Ukrainians have not received permission from the Americans to use the encrypted signal because the technology could fall into the hands of the Russians,” Withington explained to Der Spiegel.With modern glide bombs and fighter jets, Ukraine could gain an advantage, though limited by their small numbers. In larger quantities, these weapons could severely impact Russian forces, but given uncertain US support, a significant increase in capability seems unlikely for now.You could close this page.

I think that the best way to get Donald Trump to step back is to inflict as many negative consequences as possible on his economy so that Wall Street collapses, so that inflation grows in the United States, so that businesses start to worry and so that Trump’s promise to make Americans richer becomes untenable.”Tariff War Could Impact Americans at Every LevelEconomists warn that broad tariff hikes could worsen inflation, making it more difficult for governments to control consumer prices. Experts argue that the impact will disproportionately affect lower-income households, while even wealthy business leaders are raising concerns.Tesla, the EV company owned by Elon Musk, published a statement on Friday cautioning against the tariff increases. The letter highlighted the risks posed to U.S. companies, warning that American exporters were “exposed to disproportionate impacts” if other nations countered with retaliatory measures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Graves dug for victims of nightclub fire</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4aSy5JDt4</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TG4aSy5JDt4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:05:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bulldozers and workers dug a line of fresh graves in a North Macedonia town’s cemetery after at least 59 people were killed in a nightclub fire.

But this was more of a tactical gambit than a calculated strategy, and he could not have predicted what would follow. Though U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House has caught Europe flat-footed, it can still keep Putin from walking away a winner.For now, Putin seems to hold all the cards. The transatlantic relationship is fracturing, as Trump’s isolationist administration criticizes its European allies and casts doubt on his commitment to NATO. Worse, Trump appears to be aligning the United States with Russia in the Ukraine war. While he has threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached, he has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the fighting and suspended military aid and intelligence.But Europe still has a chance to turn things around. Already, it is abandoning its post-Cold War “end of history” mindset, according to which international law reigned supreme, European militaries were for keeping peace, not fighting wars, and the U.S. could be counted on to safeguard Europe’s security.Finland and Sweden were perhaps the first to realize that “history is back,” and their accession to NATO — in 2023 and 2024, respectively — provided a major boost to the Alliance’s northern flank. Now the European Union also appears to be coming to terms with its new security situation, having just announced an $840 billion rearmament plan. Even Germany, for which the return of history is particularly fraught, is preparing to rearm: incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his likely coalition partners have agreed to create a 500 billion euro ($544 billion) infrastructure fund and loosen fiscal rules to allow for greater investment in defense.The significance of this move should not be underestimated. Since the end of World War II, Germany has eschewed hard power in favor of the soft kind, serving as an engine of European integration and a bulwark of the rules-based world order. Beginning in the 1960s, this included the pursuit of “constructive engagement” — a foreign-policy approach known as Ostpolitik — with the Soviet Union and then Russia. This explains former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s embrace of Russian energy supplies, despite the objections of other EU members and the U.S.Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine drove a stake through the heart of Ostpolitik. Within days, Merkel’s successor, Olaf Scholz, announced an “epochal change” ("Zeitenwende") in Germany’s defense and foreign policy. But it is Merz who is set to oversee a true break from Germany’s postwar past — a change that will require the country to confront the most daunting, destructive ghosts of its history.For starters, there is the fiscal revolution. Germany’s frugality has been a source of considerable tension in the EU, particularly during the eurozone debt crisis of the early 2010s. But Germans — not least Merkel — recalled all too well how hyperinflation had paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler, and in 2009 Merkel’s first government introduced a constitutional restriction on structural budget deficits to 0.35% of GDP annually, also known as the “debt brake” ("Schuldenbremse"). Against this backdrop, Merz’s planned overhaul of borrowing rules — including the modification and possible elimination of the debt brake — represents a radical change in Germany’s priorities.More broadly, Merz appears prepared to embrace European leadership. Despite being the EU’s largest economy, Germany has long been reluctant to assume a genuine leadership role in Europe, particularly in the security domain. The combination of Russian revanchism and U.S. isolationism, however, has made this stance untenable. As Europe’s most populous country, situated in the continent’s “geostrategic center,” Merz says, Germany must “take greater responsibility for leadership” on defense.To avoid a repeat of the Munich Agreement of 1938 — when France and Britain forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Hitler, setting the stage for World War II — Europe must step up quickly to improve Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and, thus, at the negotiating table. Fortunately, substituting lost U.S. financial aid will not be as difficult as Trump would have us believe: to date, Europe has provided far more support for Ukraine’s war effort in dollar terms than the U.S. has. Fulfilling the weapons gap would, however, be far more challenging and probably impossible in the all-important short term.Once a peace agreement is reached, Europe will have to act as its guarantor — and that means delivering effective deterrence against Russian aggression. A credible nuclear umbrella is essential. That is why Merz has suggested replacing U.S. nuclear warheads in Europe with French and British alternatives. There is even talk of Germany becoming a nuclear power itself.When NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in 1999, Germany’s then-chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, ruled that sending ground troops to fight in a country that had once been occupied by Hitler’s "Wehrmacht" was “unthinkable.” Today, as Merz seems to recognize, the unthinkable has become necessary. Only if Germany — and Europe as a whole — puts aside its moral and political inhibitions can it continue to perform its most important role: as a global force for peace and a defender of democratic principles.Editor’s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cubans buy potable water as pipes fail during energy crisis | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ybKgWZT64</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/G2ybKgWZT64?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:54:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Alternative sources to obtain drinking water are emerging in Havana with businesses selling purified or well water amid an energy crisis in Cuba.

Yet that effort has sparked angst among European leaders who worry President Donald Trump may concede too much on Ukraine’s behalf in a direct exchange with Putin and leave Kyiv without any longer-term security guarantees. Trump believes there is a "very good chance" for a deal, and the discussion will focus on territory, power plants, and dividing up certain assets.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta and Lizzy Burden.

Tišina. Zbunjujuća gomila ljudi preda mnom. Posle 12 minuta, odjednom se začula buka, nisam mogla da shvatim šta je, onda su krenule trube i odjednom je u gužvi ispred mene nastala uspaničena gomila. Bila sam pritisnuta uz ulazna vrata sa drugima, potpuno zbunjujuća situacija, trebalo je trenutak da se vratimo u normalu, ljudi su stalno trčali ka parku Slavija. Osećala sam ekstremnu vrtoglavicu oko 30 minuta, čudan unutrašnji nemir, pripisala sam to gomili, ali to može biti i zbog upotrebe, ko zna šta je to, jer sve više ljudi koji su to iskusili prijavljuju slične simptome. Pored toga i o bolovima u uhu, vrtoglavici i poremećajima spavanja“, navela je ona na mreži X.Podsetimo, na velikom protestu u subotu u Beogradu, dok je trajala petnaestominutna tišina u pomen žrtvama pada nadstrešnice, došlo je do incidenta – kada se čuo zvuk koji je među okupljenima izazvao strah, a za koji se spekuliše da je proizveden zvučnim topom.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and discuss ending the war in Ukraine, after positive talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow.

2. The Trump administration has deported alleged members of a Venezuelan gang from the U.S. despite a court order forbidding it from doing so, saying in an extraordinary statement that a judge did not have the authority to block its actions.

3. The United States carried out new airstrikes on Yemen on Monday, the Houthis' Al Masirah TV said, expanding the biggest U.S. military operation in the Middle East since President Donald Trump took office in January.

4. China's retail sales growth quickened in January-February in a welcome sign for policymakers' efforts to boost domestic consumption even as joblessness rose and factory output eased, underscoring the strains on an economy facing fresh U.S. trade pressure.

5. Fire ripped through a packed and unlicensed nightclub early on Sunday in the North Macedonian town of Kocani, killing 59 people and injuring more than 150, officials said, after sparks ignited the roof as a live band performed.
