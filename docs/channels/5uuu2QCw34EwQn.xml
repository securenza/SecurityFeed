"We obviously cannot take your word for it," Jarlov wrote in his post.He added that the US could scupper Copenhagen's use of the F-35 just by stopping the supply of spare parts — a similar dilemma that Ukraine faced when Washington temporarily paused military aid."I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse," wrote Jarlov, who is also his party's spokesperson for his stance on Greenland's affairs.Jarlov further accused the US of wanting "to strengthen Russia and weaken Europa.""Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible," he said."I encourage our friends and allies to do the same," Jarlov added.Denmark announced in 2016 that it was spending about $3 billion on 27 F-35s to replace its aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. Jarlov was serving as Denmark's defense committee chairman at the time.Copenhagen has received 17 of its orders so far.His comments come as President Donald Trump has said that he wants to buy or annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that's rich in minerals and can provide the US with a strategic location near the Arctic.Leaders in both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly resisted Trump's statements, saying their governments had no interest in the territory coming under US administration or rule."There is no threat from China against Greenland and China has no presence in Greenland," Jarlov wrote on Sunday. "The only threat against Greenland is the USA."Meanwhile, Second Lady Usha Vance, White House national security advisor Mike Waltz, and the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are expected to visit Greenland on Thursday.Denmark isn't the only country reconsidering its defense reliance on US exports. Leaders in Portugal and Canada have also said they are reviewing their willingness to buy the F-35 amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and its allies.At least 19 governments, including the UK, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Australia, and Israel, have agreed to purchase the F-35.The F-35 is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, and while it has several competitors, its stealth features have been dominant in the market. Other planes considered adjacent or similar in capability are China's Chengdu J-20 and the French Dassault Rafale, which a British think tank said has recently surged in popularity as US ties with its allies fray.South Korea is also developing the KF-21 Boramae, but its stealth systems are expected to be less advanced than the F-35's.Lockheed Martin, the State Department, the Pentagon, and Jarlov did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saudi&apos;s art scene flourishes at the Jax district creative hub | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ojjYxl8fc</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M_ojjYxl8fc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:24:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artists and art enthusiasts in Saudi Arabia have found a haven at the Jax district creative hub.

The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.This is going to require some explaining.The story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.This is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”The term  generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.One minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”That was the end of the Thursday text chain.After receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of  in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.The next day, things got even stranger.At 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”At this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”A person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”Then, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.At 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”The Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”A few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”The account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”At this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”That message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”After reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched . Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.I went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.On Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s  and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.There was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”Shane Harris contributed reporting. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine’s most dangerous city craves relief from killer drones | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYUGvy6gkI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1IYUGvy6gkI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:53:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ukrainian city of Kherson, continually targeted by Russian drone attacks, is seeking respite.

Two sworn statements filed in federal court late Wednesday show that the SSA has staffed up in recent weeks to include four special government employees and six more DOGE staffers on loan from other departments.

Their mission: detecting waste, fraud and abuse in the nation’s 90-year-old social insurance agency.
Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” and suggested this week that there could be as much as $700 billion a year in entitlement fraud. Critics have said he is setting up a move to cut the popular program. Others are concerned about Musk’s team having access to Americans’ most sensitive data.

Ernie Tedeschi, Director of Economics at the Yale Budget Lab, discusses the inflationary risks of rising federal deficits and debt, and explains why his team thinks the social security program will go broke if not properly addressed in the near-term. Ernie speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said."If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs," Trump said during a press conference at the White House. Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year."This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China," Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC. crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S.  crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87."We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation," analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.The U.S. was the second-largest destination for Venezuelan crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to Kpler. India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office. The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.Chevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told The Wall Street Journal. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting "irregular warfare" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.Federal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked Trump's calls for Boasberg to be removed.Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

This was a lie, yet the US President continued to amplify it.The President of Ukraine added that American officials began to believe Putin at his word, even when their own intelligence contradicted the Russian dictator's statements."I believe Russia has managed to influence some people on the White House team through information. Their signal to the Americans was that the Ukrainians do not want to end the war, and something should be done to force them," Zelenskyy stated.Witkoff's statements about 'referendum'It is also worth mentioning the recent scandalous statements by Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Witkoff claimed that the "biggest problem" in the full-scale war in Ukraine is "Donbas, Crimea, Luhansk, and two other (regions - ed.)." According to him, these territories are supposedly "Russian-speaking" and "referendums" were held there during which "the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Wants to Break Canada, Prime Minister Carney Says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmiHVNeDJq8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rmiHVNeDJq8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:29:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says America will never own Canada. “Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us," Carney said on March 23.

Kyiv supported a mutual halt on energy strikes but accused Russia of continuing attacks against Ukraine's civilian targets.Washington and Kyiv previously backed a broader 30-day ceasefire that would include ground operations, but Moscow rejected the proposal unless it included a halt on foreign military support for Ukraine and other conditions that would weaken Kyiv's ability to defend itself.Sources close to Trump told the Telegraph that he remains committed to brokering a ceasefire but is growing impatient.Despite this, White House officials, "those closest to the president," reportedly maintain a calm atmosphere and urge patience with the process.Meanwhile, Russian forces continue heavy attacks on Ukrainian cities. At least four people were killed and 13 injured in Russian strikes over the past day, regional officials reported on March 24.Kyiv has also reportedly launched strikes against Russia. Ukrainian drones attacked the Kavkazskaya oil pumping station in Russia's Krasnodar Krai on March 19, causing a fire that firefighters are still battling five days later, Russian authorities claimed.On March 21, Russia also accused Ukraine of shelling the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast, a key transit facility for Russian gas exports to Europe.

You also need reconnaissance systems, satellites and probably reconnaissance drones," Gundbert Scherf, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Munich-based enterprise, told dpa on Sunday.However, Scherf believes the entire concept of modern-day defence would first need a major rethink."At the moment, the debate is still like the Cold War," he argued. "We're counting armoured systems, aircraft and ships on the other side and seeing if we can somehow get close to parity with a lot of money. And I think that's the wrong way round."Helsing specializes in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for the defence industry.It has developed the HX-2 drone - initially for use in Ukraine - which employs AI to guide explosive charges to a target and is less susceptible to electronic interference.The company has established a partnership with French space start-up Loft Orbital to monitor borders and troop movements using reconnaissance satellites.With the Swedish manufacturer Saab, preparations are being made to install an AI application for air combat in the Gripen fighter jet.Helsing also plans to present an autonomous system for use at sea soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greenland condemns planned visits by Usha Vance and Trump adviser</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0718g3jwo?xtor=AL-71-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;amp;at_medium=social&amp;amp;at_link_id=DDA11C78-08A6-11F0-9109-9DB5C646837B&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;amp;at_format=link&amp;amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;amp;at_link_origin=BBCWorld</link><author>/u/sh0tgunben</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:20:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Greenland's politicians have condemned plans for high-profile US visits, in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.Second Lady Usha Vance will make a cultural visit this week, and a separate trip is expected from Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede described the plan as aggressive, and said the duo had not been invited for meetings. Meanwhile, the island's likely next leader accused the US of showing a lack of respect.Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.Watch: Greenland is 'in our future,' says TrumpIt governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest - and has had a military base on the island since World War Two.It is also thought Trump is interested in the island's rare earth minerals. His son Donald Jr visited Greenland before Trump's inauguration in January. Announcing Mrs Vance's visit, the White House said the second lady would visit historical sites and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.Her delegation - including her son - would be there to "celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity", the statement said.Waltz's trip was confirmed by a source who spoke to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He is expected to visit before Mrs Vance and to travel with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, according to the New York Times.  Outgoing PM Egede described Waltz's visit in particular as a provocation. "What is the security advisor doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us," he told Sermitsiaq newspaper. Speaking to the same paper, Greenland's probable next PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen accused the American officials of showing the local population a lack of respect.US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the United States has a vested interest in the Arctic, and so "it should not be a surprise the National Security Advisor and Secretary of Energy are visiting a US Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground". He said that the visit is also an opportunity to " build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation" and to "learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people". Trump appeared to escalate his campaign to take over the island during a conversation with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte earlier this month.Greenland was already on the defensive about Trump's talk of a takeover, but he sent further shockwaves by implying he might ask to take the island with support of Nato, a military alliance of which Denmark is also a part."You know, Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favourite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful," Trump said. "We'll be talking to you."When asked about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: "I think that will happen."The move prompted Greenland's leading political parties to issue a joint statement to condemn the American president's "unacceptable behaviour".The issue took centre-stage in the recent election, during which Egede's governing Inuit Ataqatigiit party was defeated in a surprise result by Nielsen's Democratic party, which favours a gradual approach to independence from Denmark.Earlier this month, during a speech to the US Congress, Trump said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future. "If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," he said.According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.Watch: Danish journalist on what Greenlanders think about Trump's comments]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Market Talk: PMI data does &apos;give some hope&apos; for Europe&apos;s economy | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tcp3lZcTI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M8tcp3lZcTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:06:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest PMI data showed that the euro zone business activity grew at its fastest pace in seven months in March.

Steve Daines, a close ally of President Donald Trump, laid out the condition in meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing over the weekend. 
That contrasts with China’s claim that it has already forcefully cracked down on the fentanyl trade.

            Greenland’s prime minister said a planned visit to the island by US officials, including second lady Usha Vance, is “highly aggressive,” plunging relations to a new low after President Donald Trump vowed to annex the autonomous Danish territory.
    
            But despite the backlash, Trump has insisted the visit is about “friendliness, not provocation” – and claims the US team was “invited.”
    
            Vance, the wife of US Vice President JD Vance, will travel to Greenland this week to watch the island’s national dogsled race and “celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” according to a statement from the White House. National security adviser Mike Waltz is also expected to visit the territory this week, according to a source familiar with the trip.
    
            Greenland Prime Minister Mute B. Egede called the US delegation’s trip to the island “highly aggressive” in an interview with Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq on Sunday, and raised particular objection to Waltz’s visit.
    
            “What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,” Egede said. “His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump’s mission — and the pressure will increase.”
    
            Trump claimed on Monday that people in Greenland have responded warmly to the US’s recent interest in the territory. “They’re calling us. We’re not calling them. And we were invited over there,” he said.
    
             “We’re dealing with a lot of people from Greenland that would like to see something happen with respect to them being properly protected and properly taken care of,” Trump told reporters following a meeting with his Cabinet.
    
            “I think Greenland is going to be something that maybe is in our future,” Trump added.
    
            The president said he believes Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be traveling to Greenland too.
    
            Trump’s idea to annex Greenland has thrown an international spotlight on the territory, which holds vast stores of rare earth minerals critical for high-tech industries, and has raised questions about the island’s future security as the US, Russia and China vie for influence in the Arctic. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in the US taking the island by force or economic coercion, even as Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected the idea.
    
            “I think we’re going to get it one way or the other,” Trump said during remarks to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.
    
            Egede, who has pushed for Greenland’s independence from Denmark, said Greenlanders’ effort to be diplomatic just “bounces off Donald Trump and his administration in their mission to own and control Greenland.”
    
            Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is likely to be Greenland’s next leader after his party won the election, said the timing of the American visit shows “a lack of respect.”
    
            “The fact that the Americans know very well that we are still in a negotiating situation and that the municipal elections have not yet concluded, they still capitalize on the moment to come to Greenland, once again, which shows a lack of respect for the Greenlandic population,” Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.
    
            The White House presented Vance’s visit as a cultural one, and said the second lady “will travel to Greenland with her son and a United States delegation to visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland’s national dogsled race.”
    
            “Ms. Vance and the delegation are excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” the White House statement said.
    
            It is unclear whether the US has ever sent a delegation to the dogsled race, much less a group featuring a second lady.
    
            Denmark ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953, when the island achieved greater powers of self-governance. In 2009, it gained more powers pertaining to minerals, policing and courts of law, but Denmark still controls security, defense, foreign and monetary policy. Greenland also benefits from Denmark’s European Union and NATO memberships.
    
            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a written comment to Reuters that the visit of the US delegation is “something we take seriously.” She said Denmark wants to cooperate with the US, but that should be based on “the fundamental rules of sovereignty.”
    
            While Greenlandic politicians have repeatedly signaled they are opposed to annexation, they are open to deals with the United States for rare earth mining, expanding tourism, stronger diplomatic connections and other investments.
    
            A poll in January, commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers, found that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to become part of the US, with nearly half saying Trump’s interest was a threat, Reuters reported.
    
            The president’s son Donald Trump, Jr. made headlines with a visit to Greenland in January.
    
            “Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. Make Greenland Great Again!” Trump Jr. posted on social media at the time.

The Kyiv Post was unable to independently verify the video’s location or timing.The report specifies that the Ka-52 is an attack helicopter used by Russia for reconnaissance and striking ground targets. In contrast, the Mi-8 transport helicopters are deployed to move personnel and cargo and support ground operations.According to open sources, a Ka-52 helicopter costs approximately $16 million, and an Mi-8 around $8 million.As reported by Kyiv Post, the Kamaz Ka-52 Alligator is widely regarded by military analysts as one of the world’s top attack helicopters, thanks to its counter-rotating rotors, advanced targeting systems, heavy armor, and powerful weaponry.Designed for a two-person crew, the Ka-52 is heavily promoted for its Vikhr attack missile, which Moscow claims can destroy a tank from a distance of 10 km. This allows Ka-52 gunners to hit targets beyond the range of many battlefield point-defense systems such as MANPADS.According to Forbes, Ka-52 helicopters were likely responsible for some of Ukraine’s equipment losses during the 2023 counteroffensive, using their long-range missiles to engage targets while hovering over the battlefield.The Mi-8 (NATO designation: Hip) is a versatile twin-engine helicopter developed by the Mil Design Bureau in the early 1960s. It is one of the most widely produced helicopters in aviation history and is used extensively for both civilian and military operations.Equipped with advanced navigation, flight instruments, and radio systems, the Mi-8 can operate in both clear and challenging weather conditions, day or night.The helicopter comes in multiple configurations. The passenger version seats up to 18 people, while the transport variant features folding benches for up to 24 troops.The Mi-8MT military transport modification is designed for troop deployment and evacuation, fire support, precision bombing, and cargo transport, making it a key asset for airborne operations.As per the SSO, all helicopters were destroyed in an artillery missile strike on a concealed Russian jump pad - an improvised, camouflaged position used for rapid redeployment and surprise attacks against Ukraine’s Security and Defense Forces.“The enemy once again believed it was safe deep in the rear. We have once again proven that nothing is beyond the reach of the SSO,” the report read.This operation adds to a series of precision strikes carried out by Ukrainian forces in the Russian rear. On March 20, the HUR reported hitting multiple targets in Russian-occupied Crimea in recent days, including air defense systems, the tugboat Fedor Uryupin, and a Mi-8 helicopter.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police Officers Use Pepper Spray on a Demonstrator Wearing Dervish Clothes | Istanbul, Turkey</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jilyxo/police_officers_use_pepper_spray_on_a/</link><author>/u/arsenpontius</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 08:31:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Targeted Tariff Hopes &amp; US Hails &apos;Productive&apos; Ukraine Talks | Daybreak: Europe 03/24/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqQgPyGZ2uw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TqQgPyGZ2uw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 08:20:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead.

Vi må derfor se alvoren i øjnene og erkende, at hver eneste minut gælder for, at amerikanernes drøm om at annektere vores land ikke bliver til realitet, og der har vi brug for et handlekraftigt og beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, som kan træde til på vegne af befolkningen, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede (IA).Hvor bliver vores allierede af?Múte Bourup Egede mener, at de demokratiske lande og især Grønlands allierede er alt for tøvende med at erklære og udvise deres støtte til Grønland:- Indtil for nyligt kunne vi trygt stole på amerikanerne, som jo var vores allierede og venner, og som vi yndede at arbejde tæt sammen med. De har udvist respekt for os som et samfund, og vi har lavet gode samarbejdsrelationer, som gerne skulle holde i mange år. Men den tid er forbi, det må vi erkende, for den nye amerikanske ledelse er helt og aldeles ligeglad med, hvad vi hidtil har stået sammen om, for nu gælder det kun for dem at overtage vores land hen over hovedet på os, siger Múte Bourup Egede og fortsætter:- Ja, de vestlige allierede stod sammen og hjalp hinanden i tykt og tyndt, men det er endevendt nu med den siddende præsident i USA. Men at vores øvrige allierede i det internationale samfund føles at gemme sig i et lille hjørne og nærmest hvisker, at de støtter os, har ingen effekt, og hvis de ikke højlydt siger fra overfor, hvordan USA behandler Grønland, vil situationen eskalere dag for dag, og den amerikanske aggression vil tiltage. Så vi har behov for, at vores øvrige allierede klart og tydeligt kommer med deres støtte og opbakning til os, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede til Sermitsiaq.Mike Waltz-signalet er ikke til at misforståMúte Bourup Egede henviser til det forestående "private" besøg, hvor vicepræsidentens hustru, Usha Vance, med stor sandsynlighed vil have følgeskab af Donald Trumps sikkerhedsrådgiver Mike Waltz.Bourup Egede mener, at det er en meget klar provokation, og at det er en farlig en af slagsen:- Vi er nu på et niveau, hvor det på ingen måde kan karakteriseres som et harmløs besøg fra en politikerkone, der er udsigt til. For hvad skal sikkerhedsrådgiveren i Grønland? Det eneste formål er at vise magtdemonstration over for os, og signalet er ikke til at misforstå. Det er Trumps fortrolige og nærmeste rådgiver, og alene hans tilstedeværelse i Grønland vil helt sikkert få amerikanerne til at tro på Trumps mission, og presset vil tiltage efter besøget. Så kom nu med et beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, det er nu vi har brug for det, slutter formanden for Inuit Ataqatigiit, Múte Bourup Egede.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Middle East Latest: Hamas&apos; Top Leadership in Gaza Halved in Israeli Strikes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s09-2N3cDQo</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/s09-2N3cDQo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:49:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Israel killed two members of Hamas’ de facto cabinet in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, bringing to 11 the death toll within the 20-person forum.

And so that’s what I fear — is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now,” Smith said in the telephone interview.Story continues below advertisement“‘I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials: ‘Let’s just put things on pause so we can get through an election. Let’s have the best person at the table make the argument for how they would deal with that,’ and I think that’s Pierre Poilievre.”Poilievre has been working to distance himself from the Republicans and President Trump, but an Alberta political analyst said Smith did him no favours.“We know that Danielle Smith has the potential to be a big liability for Pierre Poilievre. That’s been the case since she became premier and perhaps even before that,” said Lori Williams, a political analyst at Mount Royal University in Calgary.Story continues below advertisementAsked about Smith’s comments on Sunday, Poilievre avoided directly responding to anything she said but pointed out that Trump recently told Fox News he thought it would be easier to deal with a Liberal.The Conservatives have seen their lead in the polls evaporate in recent weeks as Trump and his trade war have become a top issue for voters, according to .The poll, published last week by Ipsos Public Affairs exclusively for Global News, found if a federal election were held now, the Liberals would secure 42 per cent of decided voter support, compared with 36 per cent for the Conservatives — widening their lead over the Tories by seven points in just three weeks.Story continues below advertisementPoilievre has shifted his overall messages as Canadian pride surged in the face of Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada.He’s putting less emphasis on the notion that “Canada is broken” and striking a more positive tone, vowing to “restore Canada’s promise” — the notion, he said, that “anyone from anywhere can achieve anything.”In the Breitbart interview, Smith also discussed how she felt former prime minister Justin Trudeau got Canada “into a ditch” after his trip to Trump’s Florida estate Mar-A-Lago following the U.S. Election in November.Smith said Trudeau made two blunders: by not ensuring Canada was meeting the two per cent military spending target for NATO, and making Canada appear fragile economically.Story continues below advertisementWilliams said the comments in the interview are another bad move by the premier.“Now that she has essentially suggested that the administration just pause the tariffs during the election — I think that in itself is problematic.“But to also say that Pierre Poilievre aligns with the values of the Trump administration — I think that becomes quite difficult for Pierre Poilievre,” Williams said, adding it it undermines his claim that Donald Trump wouldn’t want him as prime minister.Alberta Opposition leader Naheed Nenshi said Smith is putting politics ahead of Canadian unity.“Danielle Smith is more than happy to placate Trump during the worst economic crisis facing our country than she is willing to work with Canadians,” Nenshi said in a post on X Sunday afternoon.Story continues below advertisement“Calling for a pause on tariffs to politically benefit one party or another isn’t the right approach. But standing firm for Canada is.”With the federal election campaign officially beginning on Sunday, the Liberals are already using it against the federal Conservatives.“With respect to the premier’s comments: I take note of her alignment of Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump and would note that that’s one of the decisions that Canadians will have to make,” said Liberal Leader Mark Carney.In a statement to Global News on Sunday, the premier’s office said any suggestion Smith is asking the U.S. to interfere in Canada’s election is offensive and false.Story continues below advertisementSmith added she has been working with other premiers in order to convey to American officials how damaging tariffs could be – and how they need to be put on hold until after an election in order to properly renegotiate CUSMA.“Now that an election has been called I would reiterate my hope that the United States would refrain from placing tariffs on their closest ally and largest trading partner during the middle of the election,” Smith said in her statement on Sunday.Smith was scheduled to speak at the University of Alberta for an unrelated announcement on Monday. That event was postponed on Sunday afternoon.— with files from Sarah Ritchie, The Canadian Press, and Drew Stremick, Global News]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada&apos;s PM calls election, says Trump &apos;wants to break us&apos; | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKSzs78Nkjk</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hKSzs78Nkjk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 23:06:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canada's Mark Carney called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by Trump, who 'wants to break us so America can own us'.

The national security adviser is supposed to be traveling earlier in the week with the U.S. energy secretary, Chris Wright.The prime minister, Mute B. Egede, said on Sunday that Greenlanders’ effort to be diplomatic just “bounces off Donald Trump and his administration in their mission to own and control Greenland.”]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
