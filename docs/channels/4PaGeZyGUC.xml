Despite the show’s breakout success, another animated sitcom didn’t really come around until December 17th, 1989, when The Simpsons -- originally from a short segment on FOX’s Tracey Ullman Show -- starred in a Christmas special that would quickly earn the animated family their own ongoing series.

ABSTRACT
So far, most attention to GenAI in software development is on generating code. But there is as much, if not more, value in understanding existing code - particularly long-lived, large, and complex legacy systems.

At Thoughtworks we have been experimenting with using this technology with our clients, embodied in a tool called CodeConcise, which combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from the abstract syntax trees of a codebase. We have found this useful both to draw out low-level requirements and to build a high-level explanation of a system.

This talk will show what we have learned and how it could change the age old challenge of wrangling legacy at speed, iteratively and with zero downtime. [...]

Hundreds of children of members of Islamic State (IS) are stuck in Syrian camps. Often, with no hope of returning to their home nations.

Around 38,000 foreign nationals - more than 60 per cent of whom are children - are being held in Al-Hol and Roj, two closed, sprawling camps in north-eastern Syria that have been holding mostly spouses, other adult female relatives and children of male IS suspects since 2019. 
Most of the children are under 14 years old and many have spent most, if not all, of their lives in the camps. Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home.

Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O’Reilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future – and take Neil to task on his own predictions.

The conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon’s robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here – and what did sci-fi get wrong?

We break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we’re headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. 

Plus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?

Looking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry? Plus, Charles, Chuck, and Gary add their own predictions of the future to the conversation.

Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi came up with a design that can help buildings adapt to the looming threat of climate change.   

His work began in the floating community of Makoko in the Nigerian capital Lagos. Many residents live in simple houses built on stilts over a lagoon, which makes them particularly vulnerable to rising tides and extreme weather.  

Inspired by local engineering, Adeyemi came up with the “Makoko Floating System”, which allows for buildings to float on water. Its pyramid shape makes it more stable and prevents rainwater from pooling. 

On a large scale, Adeyemi hopes that his design can help Makoko, and other places around the world, adapt to the rising sea.

Wade and James’ quest for justice began more than ten years ago when they filed civil lawsuits against some of the late entertainer’s corporations in a California court, alleging that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures enabled and covered up their sexual abuse as children. The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men’s claims. 

The documentary picks up the story of the two men’s legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade’s and James’s civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. 

The documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. 

Material for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.

After more than $50 billion dollars has been spent the fantasy city has collided with reality.

Costs have soared, delays are constant, and the capital expenditure estimates to complete the projects by 2080 have ballooned to $8.8 trillion dollars, which is over 25 times the kingdom's annual budget.

Melanie Lynskey discovers a potential match for her great-grandfather with the help of DNA and a wedding announcement. Other than these clues, this mystery man had very little records to prove his existence.

New Zealand-born and Emmy Nominated actress Melanie Lynskey has become an industry staple, having amassed a plethora of thought-provoking roles in television and film over the course of 30 years. Lynskey’s career began in 1994 with the release of Peter Jackson’s acclaimed film Heavenly Creatures, which earned her a New Zealand Film Award for Best Actress. Subsequent film credits include Adam Mckay’s Don’t Look Up, Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Steven Soderbergh's The Informant, Tom McCarthy's Win Win, and many others.

Lynskey recently starred in HBO’s critically acclaimed The Last of Us, a series adaptation of the widely popular 2013 PlayStation video game of the same name and from 2003-2015, Lynskey had a popular recurring role as Rose in the hit TV show Two and A Half Men.

The double-edged sword that can make or break a TV show, cementing it forever as an icon of the medium, or dooming it to bar trivia night obscurity. 

When a popular TV show does something provocatively against the mold, networks can expect to see some angry letters, protests, or even outright boycotts. Some of these episodes deserve the criticism they get, but should we give some of these other shows a break?

ABSTRACT
AI is advancing at a rapid pace and it is transforming the way we approach development. This rapid evolution raises a number of questions and concerns regarding safety, process, and the most effective ways to leverage these powerful tools when they work directly with code.

In this talk, Michael Feathers will describe practices that acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based technology. We'll touch on practices related to code and test generation and as well as safe refactoring, design exploration and ideation. This talk is for anyone with development experience who wants to improve their practice. [...]

Dr Jo Buckberry, a battle trauma expert at the University of Bradford, believes they date from 1296 to 1357 - the Scottish Wars of Independence.

Today Jo is going to reveal to us the clues that might help identify who these people were and uncover how they met their ends. And to help add some extra historical context she's  joined by History Hit's very own Medieval expert Historian and Author Matt Lewis.

The Pacific becomes a supercontinent. Earth's deepest point is Everest Deep, and is almost nine kilometers below sea-level. And the Mid-Atlantic Canyon divides the world from pole to pole. Life finds a way but struggles in this new, upside-down, inverted world. This all sounds cool, until the oxygen runs out...

--

For as long as humans have had lice, we’ve fought hard to get rid of them. Nit combs, the fine-tooth brushes used to remove lice and their sticky eggs, have been found among the ancient remains of cultures across the globe. Today it’s estimated we spend billions of dollars each year treating infestations. So why are lice so difficult to get rid of? Nazzy Pakpour digs into these stubborn insects.

DESCRIPTION
Holly Cummins talks with Ben Evans about his latest book "Optimizing Cloud Native Java", which updates his previous work "Optimizing Java" to reflect the realities of cloud native environments.

Ben explains that performance engineering is not just technical but also psychological, emphasizing the importance of user expectations and defining clear performance goals. They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.

The book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the "fighting animals" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.

Finally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.
 
For months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.
 
DW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.

[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience. This was incorrect. The reports referred to two senior staff members, not directors. We regret the error.]

‘Enough of this. Bring up the railguns, let’s finish this and go home.’ - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015

Electromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.

The lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.

This will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick’s crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.

In this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert. Join us as we examine the intense battles, including the Battle of 73 Easting and the Battle of Norfolk, and the final withdrawal of Iraqi troops.

ABSTRACT
An informative guide to what is special about the Rust programming language and how to bring the best parts of it into your software project, whichever programming language it's implemented in.

Rust programmers spend a lot of time thinking about lifetimes, ownership and borrowing. So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).

We'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn! [...]

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.

We discuss Hakeem’s role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA’s IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn’t wear gold.

Then, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe’s expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.

Next, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter—could it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what’s been eluding us.

Plus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself—what would happen if we were hit by one? Is “now” just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up.
