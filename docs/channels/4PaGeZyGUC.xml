The decision was appealed to the King of Spain, Carlos III, who reversed the decision in a written letter, allowing Rub√©n's ancestor to become a notary!

But for years, the valuable humus layer has been thinning. Farmers in Brandenburg are clearly feeling the effects of this on their sandy fields. Many are now taking steps to prepare their farms for the future.

Years of drought, record rainfall and failed harvests: we are becoming increasingly aware of how sensitively our environment reacts to extreme weather conditions. Farmers' livelihoods are at stake. So is the ability of consumers to afford food. 
For a few years now, agriculture that focuses solely on maximum yields has been regarded with increasing skepticism. It is becoming more and more clear just how dependent we are on healthy soils.
Brandenburg is the federal state with the worst soil quality in Germany. The already thin, fertile humus layer has been shrinking for decades. Researchers and farmers who are keen to experiment are combating these developments and looking for solutions. Priority is being given to building up the humus layer, which consists of microorganisms and fungi, as well as springtails, small worms and centipedes. 
For Lena and Philipp Adler, two young vegetable farmers, the tiny soil creatures are invaluable helpers. On their three-hectare organic farm, they rely on simple, mechanical weed control, fallow areas where the soil can recover, and diversity. Conventional farmer Mark D√ºmichen also does everything he can to protect soil life on his land. For years, he has not tilled the soil after the harvest and sows directly into the field. His yields have stabilized since he began to work this way.
Isabella Krause from Regionalwert AG Berlin-Brandenburg is convinced after the experiences of the last hot summers that new crops will thrive on Brandenburg's fields in the long term. She has founded a network of farmers who are promoting the cultivation of chickpeas with support from the scientific community.

ORIGINAL TALK TITLE
Change Your Life, Help Your Team & Boost Your Business with Neurodiversity

RESOURCES

ABSTRACT
Are you a little spicy? If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.

In this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.

Neurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it‚Äôs both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.

This talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it‚Äôs adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths. [...]

They say fusion is 50 years away, no matter when you ask. Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome‚Äôs port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.

One key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.

Public temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces. They served both religious and practical functions, often housing libraries, halls, and spaces for the public to gather. Temples were dedicated to the well-being of the state, such as the Temple of Saturn, which doubled as the city treasury, or the Temple of Castor and Pollux, linked to military victories.

Hidden away since his death, they chart his life on the front during the first world war where he served on the western front against the French and English from 1914 to 1918. 

Writing on the morning of the 11th November, Wilhelm reveals in depth his and his comrades feelings and thoughts about the armistice - giving us never before heard insight into those final moments.

His letters and diaries from 1929 onwards reveal the rise of Hitler and the Nazis and his own involvement and ultimately the defeat of Nazi Germany and his own experience of the denazification process.

Its canopy of leaves, almost 50 meters high, towers over the crowns of the forest. The tree shapes the myths of the indigenous Wayana people.

With over 80,000 plant species and hundreds of thousands of animal species, the Amazon rainforest is a green ocean of life. In the midst of this ecosystem, the kapok tree provides both shelter and crucial spaces for reproduction. Numerous animal species could not survive without the kapok tree. 
Dragonflies and damselflies buzz around the spines on its trunk to lay their larvae in the bromeliad ‚Äòair plants‚Äô that grow on the tree. Here, the smallest influences the largest - and vice versa. Bromeliad plants do double duty, acting as floating water reservoirs: they store up to 50,000 liters of water per hectare of forest.

When the forest floor is under water during the rainy season, the fish become gardeners. They feed on the seeds that have fallen from the trees and spread them all over the Amazon region. The kapok tree is firmly anchored in the ground with its huge roots until the next dry season. The whole forest breathes, from the moss on the ground to the treetops. This gas exchange makes life on earth possible. But dangers such as deforestation and climate change threaten this unique ecosystem.

The discovery of a rare mass grave with the bones of nearly 60 people outside Luxor sends archaeologists on a quest to find out who the remains belong to, why they were buried the way they were and what was happening in ancient Egypt that would have led to a mass burial. Could the collapse of the empire‚Äôs Old Kingdom provide any clues? [Originally aired in 2019]

Following the long reign of Pepi II, a series of weak kings ruled ineffectively. Without a strong central government, local leaders asserted themselves, fracturing the country‚Äôs power base. As the climate shifted all over the world, the country was then hit by a decades-long drought that caused a great famine and economic failure.

Go behind the scenes with archaeologists and scientists as they venture through Africa ‚Äì from the Pyramids to the glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro ‚Äì in search of clues to solve the mystery of the mass grave, examining the political and environmental catastrophes that plunged Egypt and its people into anarchy. Were the bodies found victims of the famine, civil war or something else?

How did they prepare their food? How did their food contribute to their evolution and their anatomical and cognitive development? This film provides answers based on new research findings.

Food. Since the beginning of time, obtaining food has been one of the most important activities of mankind. Research using new methods for examining and analyzing human fossils reveals previously unknown facets of prehistoric man. The results demonstrate the central role that food plays in the anatomical, genetic and social evolution of humans.
Until the beginning of agriculture in the Neolithic period, the first humans fed on what nature provided for them. Their diet shaped their evolution and humanity as we know it today.
This two-part documentary invites you on a journey into the past and shows the complexity and diversity of prehistoric life based on scientific findings from around the world. Suzana Herculano-Houzel explains how the cooking of food influenced the mental performance of early humans. Delphine Vettese from the Natural History Museum in Paris shows how cutting techniques for mincing meat and scraping out bone marrow were passed down from generation to generation. Jo√£o Zilh√£o and Ernestina Badal present the results of their research into prehistoric food remains.
From archaeological sites in the Dordogne to Portugal, the USA and Jordan, the film shows spectacular images of caves, semi-caves and other prehistoric sites in nature.

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll explore how Kafka serves as a powerful platform for capturing real-time streaming data and how organizations are increasingly adopting Apache Iceberg table format to store data in data lakes and data warehouses. We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.

Next, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.

Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? Did anything go ‚Äúbang‚Äù during the Big Bang? Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!

Shouldn‚Äôt the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What‚Äôs in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went ‚Äúbang‚Äù? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. 

What can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe‚Äôs invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. 

As the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.

Finally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.

After two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichst√§tt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a "mission donation.‚Äù High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.

Lawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops‚Äô Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: "People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.‚Äù Janssen regards such practices as "a form of obstruction of justice‚Äù. No consideration at all was given to the victims. 

So did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.

--

After witnessing a bird carrying a single golden hair, King Mark of Cornwall declared his future bride must have equally radiant locks. The only royal matching this description was Princess Isolde of Ireland. So the king sent Tristan, his bravest knight, to extend an olive branch to the royal family and deliver his proposal of marriage. Iseult Gillespie shares the tale of Tristan and Isolde.

Since then, humans have made use of different kinds of torches to navigate the world at night. From the Egyptians to the Romans, to the Chinese, oil lamps were common in the cities of ancient civilizations. The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. 

But most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn‚Äôt only true for nocturnal creatures. We are also affected by exposure to artificial light and can develop serious conditions because of it, like sleep disorders, diabetes and even cancer.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck‚Äôs 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]

In 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, avian flu began aggressively circulating in wildlife. Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn‚Äôt stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It‚Äôs an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we‚Äôre not worried now, when should we be?

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today‚Äôs older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Young and radical - Why right-wing populism is on the rise | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSl4HIONvjc</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CSl4HIONvjc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There has recently been a trend in elections in Europe: young voters are turning to right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties. Why is this happening?

In the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.
