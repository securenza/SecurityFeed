This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

That’s not new.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

The Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

A week later the decision was partially reversed and at least 50 full time employees were brought back. The National Park Service also said it would hire 7,700 seasonal employees - 2,700 more than previously stated. It’s still not enough. Park employees were already struggling to meet the demands of over 325 million annual visitors before the initial downsizing. These two charts show how the staff to visitor ratio was already pushed to the limit, leading to longer lines, shorter operating hours, and a potentially less safe environment for guests. It’s about to get worse.

This January was the hottest ever recorded globally, yet it also snowed in Florida and was icy in Texas? How? Well, global warming might actually be making winter storms colder. It all has to do with the polar jetstream — a boundary of air that’s in flux depending on the differences in temperature around the globe. What effect might climate change be having on it?

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

In 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks …. good!

But de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.

Here’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.

But the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.
