In his book "What Is Intelligence?" and in this conversation, Blaise Agüera y Arcas takes up the idea that prediction is fundamental not only to intelligence and the brain but to life itself, and explores the wide-ranging implications. These include radical new perspectives on the computational properties of living systems, the evolutionary and social origins of intelligence, the relationship between models and reality, entropy and the nature of time, the meaning of free will, the problem of consciousness, and the ethics of machine intelligence.

"What is Intelligence" is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/3KaJs8f

Blaise Agüera y Arcas is a VP/Fellow at Google, where he is the CTO of Technology & Society, and the founder of Paradigms of Intelligence, an organization dedicated to fundamental AI research. He is the author of Who Are We Now?, and his research has included work on privacy-preserving machine learning, on-device AI, large language models, and human identity.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.

If God is the Creator, did God create the universe out of absolutely nothing? Would this mean that prior to God’s creation there was no matter-energy, no space-time, no laws of physics? Before God brought forth the universe, was there nothing other than God? But if the universe, or multiple universes, always existed, then what need is there for God?

Whether or not God exists is a vital question and that’s why debates about God are important. Arguments for and against the existence of God are productive. Debating God is the best way for clarifying ways of thinking and challenging conventional beliefs on all sides. We encourage debate about God, even when testy.

What are anti-realists and why do they deny objective reality? What we know of the world must come through our senses and be processed by our brains. Both can be unreliable; illusions can fool our senses and illness or injury can disrupt our brains. Therefore, can we ever be sure that anything outside ourselves is truly what it seems?

Given the myriad theories of consciousness on offer, how can they be assessed? What criteria should we use to compare and contrast diverse theories? Evaluating Materialism theories, like seeking neural correlates of consciousness, use the scientific method. But what about theories that are not Materialism?

Is there a soul? Is there an afterlife? The two questions are likely related. No soul, no afterlife. Is there any evidence for either? Any argument? However, the two questions—soul and afterlife—might be separated. A soul but no afterlife? Or an afterlife but no soul? According to science, you cannot have either. But is science the last word?

In the second installment of our six-part interview series, discover how Nobel Laureate Roger Penrose thinks about physics and hear his contrarian view of the foundations of quantum mechanics.

Throughout his career, Penrose has challenged conventional wisdom in physics, mathematics, and the philosophy of science. He has tackled some of the most profound questions of the universe: How do quantum mechanics and cosmology shape our understanding of reality? Can human consciousness be fully explained by physical laws, or does it transcend computation? This wide-ranging conversation spans Penrose’s most influential ideas, from black holes and the Big Bang to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, quantum gravity, and the role of mathematics in uncovering ultimate reality.

In the third installment of our six-interview series, hear what Nobel Laureate Roger Penrose thinks about cosmology and his radical view of how our universe began.

Throughout his career, Penrose has challenged conventional wisdom in physics, mathematics, and the philosophy of science. He has tackled some of the most profound questions of the universe: How do quantum mechanics and cosmology shape our understanding of reality? Can human consciousness be fully explained by physical laws, or does it transcend computation?
