But could this be the last time investors see moderating price growth for the foreseeable future, as the administration’s fluctuating trade policy threatens to upend the recent easing trend?

But prospects look remote, even as their tariff fight appears to have peaked.
Inflicting trade pain is unlikely to bring President Xi Jinping to the negotiating table. Instead, Chinese authorities seem intent on proving that they can withstand more economic and political suffering than their archrival.
On Friday, Beijing hiked tariffs on all US goods to 125%, mirroring a move by the White House that pushed duties on Chinese imports to the same level, on top of an existing 20% tax. China said it won’t match any further hikes, calling the repeated use of steep tariffs economically meaningless, but reiterated its vow to “fight to the end” with other, unspecified countermeasures.
“The fact that the Chinese authorities have once again matched US tariff hikes suggests that they are in no rush to negotiate with the Trump administration,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.

Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan also said that the bank will have to potentially face changing economic conditions.

- General Motors (GM) is selling off after yesterday's gains that came when President Trump signaled he's looking to pause auto tariffs so car companies can adjust to the duties. The president says the automakers will "need a little more time" to adjust to manufacturing auto parts in the US.

- Boeing (BA) is lower this morning on a headline that China has ordered its airlines to stop taking deliveries of Boeing jets and to halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies. The move is seen as part of the ongoing trade war between the US and China, with China imposing retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American goods, including aircraft and parts.

Apparently the European Union has added the United States to that list."The transatlantic alliance is over," an EU official told the newspaper, which reported the commission "is issuing burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage — a measure traditionally reserved for trips to China."Next week, officials from the EU are due in Washington DC for the spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. Four sources told the FT the EC had changed its guidance to ensure that visitors to America take serious precautions against cyber-espionage."They are worried about the US getting into the commission systems," said one.The relationship between the US and Europe has chilled severely in the past few months since President Trump threatened to invade Greenland, slapped tariffs on Euro imports, backed a Sieg-Heil'ing Elon Musk, sent Vice President JD Vance to lecture the continent on free speech, humiliated Ukraine's president, and made other smart foreign policy moves.Germany, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Ireland have all altered their travel advice for citizens visiting the Land of the Free, mainly urging travelers to follow all requirements as strictly as possible or consider simply not going, after a bunch of visitors from the EU and UK were detained for visa and immigration infractions. Trans-gendered travelers are advised that they may be barred from entry.France’s minister of higher education and research, Philippe Baptiste, lodged an official complaint last month after one French boffin was reportedly barred from entering the country for a conference after a border patrol examination of their phone found what was said to be extreme anti-Trump comments, although the US says it was because officers found confidential American information in the scientist's possession.Taking a burner device, to be honest, sounds like standard practice for people in sensitive lines of work, though this is all being interpreted as an indication of quite how badly relations have slipped between Europe and the US. And while a certain amount of spying on one's allies is expected – former German chancellor Angela Merkel was most peeved when it turns out her phone was being bugged by the NSA – a recommendation to take fresh devices is something new.Ultimately, spies spy, and when it comes to spying on the world, no one doubts America's abilities, regardless of who is in charge."Washington is not Beijing or Moscow, but it is an adversary that is prone to use extra-legal methods to further its interests and power," Luuk van Middelaar, director of the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics think tank, told the FT."Democrat administrations use the same tactics. It is an acceptance of reality by the Commission."A European Commission spokesperson, an in email to , did not deny equipment was being handed out to staff as reported. And while the spinner claimed the commission had not issued formal guidance to use burner laptops and phones, they did admit it had tweaked its recommendations."We have recently updated several country specific traveling recommendation factsheets for officials. They reflect the latest changes in the way the commission communicates and the general increase of threats globally regarding cybersecurity," the spokesperson told us."Finally, indeed we recommend linking the e-visa to an EU laissez-passer for senior officials, in order to underline the official nature of the visit and facilitate visa processes in embassies prior to departure. Again, these updated recommendations were included in many other countries' factsheets to the attention of travelling senior officials."We understand the FT stands by its yarn. And it wouldn't be the first time the EU had denied a story, only to later confirm its veracity. ® Facebook giant Meta intends to train its AI on public posts and other data in Europe after last year pausing the practice. "People based in the EU who use our platforms can choose to object to their public data being used for training purposes," the tech giant noted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Robert F.

That’s one of the key findings in a new report from Copernicus and the World Meteorological Organization. In Spain’s Valencia region, the damage is still being felt after October’s floods. Local officials are now proposing new defences — but many worry they may come too late.

The Republican House budget plan would likely require significant cuts to the program in order to pass President Trump’s priorities. Cutting spending to Medicaid could be executed by reducing waste and fraud, reducing federal matching dollars and imposing work requirements at the state level like Arkansas is proposing. 

WSJ explores how the program works and how the GOP could reduce its funding.

He didn’t elaborate on what specific actions that would entail.China and the U.S. have spent the past two weeks locked in an escalating trade war, with both sides piling on new tariffs and raising barriers to trade. Chinese imports to the U.S. now face tariffs of at least 145%, while American goods headed to China are being hit with a 125% rate — levels so high they’re likely to bring trade between the two largest economies to a near standstill.The impact is expected to hit China hard. Its economy is already under pressure from deflation, sluggish consumer demand and a prolonged property slump. Economists have been downgrading their forecasts for China’s growth this year, with UBS Group AG the most pessimistic among major banks, predicting the economy will expand just 3.4% as U.S. tariffs choke exports. Zhu said China has “full confidence” in meeting its growth target of around 5% this year, pointing out that it’s the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the country is on track to achieve the goals laid out in it.He was also optimistic that domestic consumption will rise this year and said China has “full capacity” to ramp up spending if necessary.Zhu served as deputy finance minister until his retirement in 2018, overseeing the Customs Tariff Department and playing a key role in U.S.-China trade negotiations. He was most recently a counselor to the State Council.Chinese officials have repeatedly said they’re open to negotiations, but not under pressure or threats. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Trump expects talks “at some point,” though “we’re not there yet.” The president has said he’s waiting for China’s call and described Xi as a friend for whom he has “great respect,” highlighting his preference for negotiating leader-to-leader.Zhu criticized the U.S. tariffs as being highly damaging to China’s national interests and said Beijing has a long-standing position of not giving in to external pressure. He added that coercion from Washington would be ineffective in resolving the dispute.When asked if China might sell off its Treasury holdings in response to the tariffs, Zhu said the Chinese government is a “very responsible investor” that values global market stability. China, which owns about $700 billion in US debt, is the second-largest foreign creditor after Japan, raising concerns it could use those holdings as leverage.“However, this is based on mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual cooperation,” Zhu said, referring to China’s stance on its Treasury holdings. “I really hope US and China can, based on mutual respect, return to negotiation.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Virginia Gov.

"Técnico responded that it would not respond to the questionnaire because it was not appropriate for a public higher education institution to be subject to public and legal scrutiny in a democratic country that is a member of the European Union", stated Rogério Colaço. According to the president of IST, the communication of the cancellation of the programme, followed by a questionnaire, cites a determination issued by the US State Department. In Portugal, "American Corners", financed by the US government and which the US Embassy in Lisbon describes as "information and culture centers", are six and all operate in university institutions.In addition to IST, the universities of the Azores, Aveiro, Porto (Faculty of Arts), Lisbon (Faculty of Arts) and Nova de Lisboa (Faculty of Science and Technology) have these spaces. At IST, "American Corners" had been operating for more than ten years and, according to Rogério Colaço, promoted lectures, meetings and "dissemination as well as scientific activities", whereby annual financing was around 20 thousand euros.The director of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Lisbon (FLUL), Hermenegildo Fernandes, told Lusa that he received the same questionnaire, which left him astonished by the "scale of the shamelessness" of the questions, namely about "climate agendas", whether the institution had "contacts with communist and socialist parties" or "relations with the United Nations, the People's Republic of China, Iran and Russia" and what "it did to protect women from gender ideologies". The faculty also chose not to respond to the questionnaire, noting that "its dependence is on the scientific policies of Portugal and the European Union", said the director of FLUL, without clarifying whether the "American Corners" programme was cancelled or not for the faculty, which has an "American space" sharing nearby facilities with the Confucius Institute, an official Chinese entity that promotes the country's culture and language.Contacted by the Faculty of Science and Technology of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the institution's management told Lusa, without further details, that the "American Corner" is "an annual project that will end in September". "We are evaluating whether or not to apply to continue the project," the college added in a brief statement. Lusa was unable to obtain clarification from the universities of Porto, Aveiro and the Azores. "We have excellent relations with all six 'American corners' and we will continue to collaborate on a series of programmes and initiatives that promote our common goals," said the spokesperson for the US embassy in Lisbon, Marie Blanchard, without directly responding to a question from Lusa, but praising that the American spaces "demonstrate the unparalleled power of the United States as an economic and innovation leader". Lusa asked the embassy whether, following the cuts announced by the Trump administration to funding for universities and scientific agencies, the "American Corner" programme would be affected and in what ways.According to the website of the United States Embassy in Portugal, there are more than 600 "American spaces" in more than 140 countries and they are located, namely, in universities, shopping centers, libraries and embassy facilities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chinese Communist Party official in Hong Kong calls US tariffs &apos;senseless&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHaRPm2aRJk</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tHaRPm2aRJk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:19:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A Chinese Communist Party official in Hong Kong attacked the U.S. in a speech Tuesday, calling recent tariffs "senseless".

The home-growns. You gotta build about five more places. It's not big enough," Trump can be heard saying.During the meeting, both leaders indicated that returning Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a father from Maryland who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador, to the US was not their concern, despite the Supreme Court ordering his return. Instead, Trump expressed his desire to deport American criminals to El Salvador if permitted by law."I'd like to go a step further. I said to Pam (Bondi, US Attorney General), I don't know what the laws are, we always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people into subways ... I'd like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country," Trump said.Trump also told Bukele that he wanted him to facilitate the building of more institutions like El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in the country to house more prisoners from the US.CECOT is the largest prison in the Americas, having opened in 2023 and housing 40,000 inmates. It includes multiple electric fences, 19 watchtowers and over 1,000 armed guards.© 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

It marked one of the worst attacks against Sumy throughout the full-scale war.Canada, currently chairing the G7 group, reportedly told other members that the statement could not be adopted without U.S. support. According to Bloomberg, the statement was to denounce Russia's attack as evidence that Moscow is determined to continue its war.While European leaders have denounced the attack as a war crime, Trump adopted a softer tone, saying that while the strike was "terrible," it likely occurred by "mistake," without elaborating further.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered condolences to the victims of the "horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy" but stopped short of calling for an increasing pressure on Russia.The move is only the latest in the string of Washington's steps undermining G7 unity on Russia and Ukraine. The Trump administration has previously opposed a joint statement on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale war and vetoed a proposal for a task force tracking the Russian "shadow fleet" of tankers.Since taking office in January, Trump has upended years of U.S. foreign policy on the Russia- Ukraine war, resuming direct contact with Moscow while exerting pressure on Kyiv by temporarily cutting off crucial military aid.Trump has pledged to broker a swift ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, but these efforts have largely stalled as Moscow rejects a 30-day truce supported by Washington and Kyiv. Despite these delays, Trump has yet to exert additional pressure on Russia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coogler&apos;s &apos;Sinners&apos; has vampires, blues and Michael B.

So far, twelve million people have been displaced as the country enters its third year of civil war.
Today, diplomats from around the world are meeting in London at a conference seeking to end the conflict, and provide more humanitarian relief. The UK and Germany have both announced new funding for aid organizations working in the region. However, neither of the warring parties are at the summit.
As hunger and atrocities continue to mount it looks as though Sudan may be split into two rival administrations.

His remarks came during an Oval Office meeting where multiple officials in President Donald Trump's administration said they were not required to bring him back, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order saying they must facilitate the Maryland resident's return.

I love European people," Vance told news and opinion website UnHerd on Monday in rare favourable comments about the European Union and Britain."It's not good for Europe to be the permanent security vassal of the United States," Vance said, echoing his previous rebukes of EU states for alleged security and economic dependence on the United States."I don't want the Europeans to just do whatever the Americans tell them to do. I don't think it's in their interest, and I don't think it's in our interests, either."In the past few weeks, US President Donald Trump has upended the global economic order by imposing and then partially walking back sweeping global tariffs.From the war in Ukraine to claims over Greenland, Trump's policies are testing relations with long-standing American allies.Just weeks after taking up his post, Vance made headlines after launching a withering attack against Europe on culture war issues at the Munich Security Conference.According to Vance, it is "good for the United States" if Europe is more "independent" -- allowing countries to "stand up" to US foreign policy decisions."I think a lot of European nations were right about our invasion of Iraq," said the vice president. "If the Europeans had been a little more independent, and a little more willing to stand up, then maybe we could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq."Seeking to allay fears of further trade wars and economic insecurity, Vance said Trump's policies "will lead to a lot of positive trade relationships with Europe".However, he said that would be trickier to achieve for some countries like Germany, which he said was "heavily dependent on exporting to the United States."But the vice president was singing praises of the UK, saying "there's a good chance that... we'll come to a great agreement that's in the best interest of both countries".British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been seeking to appease the new administration and secure a favourable trade deal -- with King Charles III inviting Trump for a rare second state visit."The president really loves the United Kingdom. He loved the queen," said Vance. "He admires and loves the king. It is a very important relationship."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is the &apos;Buy Canadian&apos; movement working?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5WoXEnT-30</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M5WoXEnT-30?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump's tariffs and threats to annex Canada have spurred Canadians to boycott U.S. products and cancel trips south of the border. The "Buy Canadian" movement has become a rallying cry for the country, but one economist says there could also be a significant economic impact — to the tune of $10 billion annually.

Most Chinese exporters Reuters spoke with said U.S. orders have either been delayed or stopped coming - a bad sign for the world's second-largest economy, whose growth last year relied heavily on running a trillion-dollar trade surplus.
No other country comes close to matching China's sales of more than $400 billion in goods to the U.S. each year.

Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt any purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies, the people said. The move is part of the broader tit-for-tat trade war that’s seen US President Donald Trump levy tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods and Beijing unveil retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American goods.

Roughly half the nation's export income originates from oil."If such tariff wars, and we are seeing an escalation of tariff wars, continue, it usually leads to a decline in global trade, the global economy, and possibly even the demand for our energy resources," Nabiullina said in remarks reported by state media."There are risks here, but we need to watch how the situation unfolds," Nabiullina added.Although Trump pressed pause on the tariffs he announced last week on multiple countries—with the notable exception of the levies on China—global markets have shuddered since the president's "Liberation Day" on April 2.Since January 15, the price of Brent crude has fallen from $83 a barrel to $64 today, with West Texas Intermediate tumbling from $78 to $60 in that period.Russia's economy is battling inflation and bloated by defense spending, as the Kremlin's invasion of neighbor Ukraine rages on. By one measure, Moscow is spending more on its military than all of Europe combined. Russian President Vladimir Putin will likely head off any spending cuts reaching the military for as long as possible, analysts told  earlier this month.The tariffs have already had an impact on Russian oil prices, dropping steeply on April 2 and struggling to rise since, said Aura Sabadus, an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank and a senior journalist specializing in energy markets with the London-based Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).Prices are roughly $10 a barrel lower since April 2 and are likely to stay put, Sabadus told . Russia is "worried," she added."While President Trump's goal of imposing tariffs was probably not to crash oil prices, low oil prices will, in the long run, negatively affect Russia's economy," said Kari Liuhto, a professor of international business at Finland's University of Turku."However, the price of oil would need to remain low for a couple of years in order to influence the actions of Russia's leadership," he told .In 2022, the G7 nations, Australia and the European Union implemented a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian crude oil to limit how much Moscow can make from its crude oil exports. The EU is a "non-enumerated" member of the G7 bloc.Europe broadly rushed to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February that year. A host of sanctions have attempted to cut off Moscow's access to its lucrative and vital oil revenues, although Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers designed to ferry Russian oil around the world and skirt sanctions makes up roughly 17 percent of the world's total number of oil tankers,  reported in December.The G7 said in December 2023 that a year of the crude oil price cap had reduced Russia's tax revenue from oil and petroleum products exports by almost a third between January and November of that year.British newspaper reported on Sunday that the U.K. and other G7 countries were weighing up lowering the $60 cap after prices fell below this threshold for the first time in years.Russia's Tass state news agency reported on Thursday that Urals, Moscow's benchmark for oil export pricing, had dropped below $50 per barrel for the first time in nearly two years.Ray Dalio, a prominent U.S. billionaire hedge fund manager, warned over the weekend that the U.S. was "very close to a recession" over Trump's tariffs and stock market turbulence, and could be staring down "something that is much worse than a recession.""The fall in the price of oil because of the expected recession in the United States is significant and will have a large impact on Russian oil revenues," said Eric Golson, an economic warfare specialist and associate professor of economics at the U.K.'s University of Surrey.Oil prices have dipped by about 25 percent so far compared with the average for last year, Golson told , equating to an expected yearly revenue loss of $50 billion for Russia."Overall, we can expect the tariffs, if they do induce a recession, to be significant net negative for Russia," Golson said.Russia has managed to relieve some of the pressure of oil sanctions by selling crude oil to third countries, such as India, which is then purchased as refined oil products from these nations by Western countries, Liuhto said. "Russia has been able to find many buyers, particularly China and India," added Sabatus.Russian Gas 'Really Suffering'While oil is a larger chunk of Russia's revenues, tariffs could also hit Russian gas exports, namely of liquefied natural gas, or LNG."Even though America didn't introduce any tariffs on Russia specifically, it is affected indirectly as a result of the impact on oil prices, and then also on gas," Sabatus said. "It's on gas that Russia is really suffering."Russia accounted for up to 40 percent of European gas imports before 2022, a figure now hovering at roughly 11 percent, including LNG, she added. Other players like the U.S. and Qatar have stepped into the European market in the years since.Some in Europe have started flirting with the idea that the continent could restart some Russian gas imports once a ceasefire in Ukraine is inked. Currently, only one pipeline—running through Turkey—can directly supply Russian gas to Europe. The Nord Stream pipeline was blown up in 2022 and Ukraine refused in January to renew a transit deal allowing Russian gas to travel to EU states. Another linking Russia to Poland via Belarus is not operational.Didier Holleaux, executive vice president at French energy company Engie, told Reuters in an article published on Monday that if there is a "reasonable peace in Ukraine," Europe could "go back to flows of 60 billion cubic metres, maybe 70, annually, including LNG."In that scenario, Moscow could furnish between 20 percent and 25 percent of the European Union's needs, Holleaux told the news agency.Others wonder whether Russian oil could return in significant quantities back into Europe as part of a deal designed to make Moscow atone for its invasion of Ukraine, and have Ukraine benefit from this flow. There are no pan-European sanctions on Russian gas imports said Jack Sharples, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, during a conference at the RUSI think tank on Thursday.The EU has delayed announcements on its plans to phase out Russian natural gas imports by 2027.Skepticism does still largely rule. There would be many hurdles to reinstating Russian gas flows through Europe, not least arbitration cases against Russia's state-owned gas giant Gazprom.Also in the mix are tariffs slapped on Beijing, meaning much of the LNG heading for China is being diverted toward Europe, Sabatus said.China has put 125 percent tariffs on U.S. imports, battling against the 145 percent levies the Trump administration has fixed on Chinese goods. Beijing's commerce ministry said last week it would "fight to the end" against the "blackmailing nature of the U.S."These supplies making their way to Europe, as well as American LNG supplies muscling into the market, lessen the demand for Russian exports, Sabatus said. However, there are some concerns in Europe broadly about how much the continent can depend on the U.S., from providing military capabilities to energy.Russia's prospects of "sending more LNG to Europe—potentially regaining some market share by resuming pipeline exports to Europe—is fading away, at least for the foreseeable future," Sabatus said.Update 4/15/25, 6:27 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US-China trade war: Xi’s goal on tour of Southeast Asia | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3GzMFKdFg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2c3GzMFKdFg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 08:25:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping has signed dozens of agreements with Vietnam, including trade deals, as the tariff dispute with the US continues.

On Friday the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops. But these goods remain subject to other levies.

This is what happened to Michel Barnier, 74, who held office from September to December 2024. The list grows longer if you look back. Even so, it’s still unusual for two of them to meet by chance in a restaurant. “How are you? Everything okay? I’ll call you one of these days,” Barnier says, seated at a table in a central Parisian restaurant, to fellow former prime minister François Fillon. “I lasted a little less than him,” he jokes in an interview with journalists from the European alliance Lena, which includes EL PAÍS.Barnier — a former minister, European commissioner, but known above all as the famed EU chief negotiator of the Brexit agreement — was also the oldest politician to occupy the Hôtel Matignon, official residence of France’s prime minister. He holds the record for being the occupant who lasted the shortest amount of time there. He also has enough irony to accept this fact and calmly reflect on the causes that led to it, closely linked to a certain end of an era in French politics. His downfall was the result of the chaos sown by President Emmanuel Macron after the dissolution of Parliament in June 2024. But it was also because the political left, he notes, failed to accept that it lacked a majority. Today, from a calmer perspective yet without concealing his ambition to become president of the Republic if he has enough support, Barnier reflects on the trade war with the United States and the EU’s new rapprochement with the United Kingdom following the divorce he himself helped to certify.Why do you think Trump’s America is taking such a hostile stance toward the EU? Trump is surrounded by billionaires and speculators who don’t like Europe because we are a union of 450 million people based on principles of regulation, governance and stability. We have an independent central bank, rules, banking supervision, and control mechanisms. Trump would like to make separate deals with each country, to divide and conquer. On the other hand, [Vladimir] Putin doesn’t like us either. He knows that the EU is a force of democratic attraction.You believe that the response to the international crisis must be European. Why? These days, we must learn how to adapt, to react quickly, but above all, to defend our interests in an unstable world. The first lesson of our time is that we must be European. I have always been patriotic—I admit it—but also deeply European. It is precisely in times of crisis that the need to react together is truly felt. If anyone today is looking for a reason to be European, it is there: in our collective capacity to face challenges. To do so, we must rely on our greatest asset, whether we are French, Polish, German, Italian, or Spanish.What is that common asset? The single market. During the Brexit negotiations, I firmly defended it, even against those who wanted, as they say in Germany, to “dance at two weddings at once”: to take advantage of the benefits without accepting the obligations. But the single market is immutable. It’s not just a free trade area; it’s much more. It’s an ecosystem with common rules, standards, shared regulations, coordinated oversight, and a common jurisdiction. It’s what gives us strength in global economic competition. And in a world of trade wars and geopolitical instability, it’s our greatest asset. You insist on the need for unity. Is it really possible today?European unity doesn’t just fall from the sky. As a Brexit negotiator, I can say that it’s cultivated. It requires constant political effort. And it’s that unity that brings us respect, even in the face of powers like the U.S., China and Russia. I’m convinced that Donald Trump will end up respecting Europe. For now, he respects almost no one, judging by his words and methods. But they will respect us because we are the single market, the largest and wealthiest in the world. And you only enter it by respecting its rules.How can we defend European interests? Methodically. European unity isn’t decreed, it’s built as we did during Brexit. It would require a clearly identified figure who speaks on behalf of the three EU institutions—the Commission, the Council and Parliament—who is accountable to everyone and takes the time to explain and convince.Should we be prepared to adopt more trade sanctions against the U.S.? Yes, we must prepare. There is, for example, the European Anti-Coercion Instrument, which would allow us to temporarily close our market to certain American products. It’s an extreme measure, but it must remain on the table. We mustn‘t announce it too soon, but we must prepare it seriously. We must avoid hasty or disorderly responses. Don’t give in too quickly. And above all, don’t be fazed. I’m clear on one point: there was embezzlement. Four and a half million euros were stolen, and there must be sanctions. There’s no room for debate about that. And I recommend not questioning the independence of the judiciary. However, the general framework can be questioned: the law provides that a disqualification ruling can be enforced before all appeals have been exhausted. This is an important institutional issue that deserves serious debate in Parliament, and not fast-tracked to resolve a particular candidate’s situation.Should this provision be reviewed? Perhaps. Not for Le Pen, but for the future. I’m against circumstantial laws. But is it fair that a defendant, whoever they may be, can be hit with a disqualification sentence before the end of the proceedings?What are the main lessons you have learned from your time at Matignon? First, the fragmentation of the parties: today there is no longer a stable majority, as there was during the Fourth Republic, but there is also no spirit of compromise. The Socialist Party (PS) refused any discussion from the start. They told me: “We’ll vote for the motion of no confidence because you’re not left-wing.” Second lesson: how difficult it is to reactivate the state in France when it has come to a standstill.Don’t you have the feeling that the Fifth Republic is exhausted, with a president who has lost some of his power? No, I don’t think the Fifth Republic is dead. It works, but we need to return to its original spirit: a president who presides and a government that governs.What were the reasons for your short-lived tenure? There was no majority. I knew I could fall at any moment. That’s why I didn’t move to Matignon with my wife. I was cautious. The Socialist Party had no real reason to censure me, except for its commitment to [La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc] Mélenchon: to vote against any prime minister who wasn’t “left-wing.” It was an ideological position.Wasn’t that a mistake on President Macron’s part? Should he have appointed someone from the left? He should have tried a coalition with the Republicans (LR) much earlier. He appointed me at the last minute, against the ropes.Is there a real rapprochement between the EU and the UK? There are signs of that, and it’s as much in their interest as it is in ours. I’ve always considered Brexit a grave mistake, contrary to the British national interest. I don’t know of any other nation, in peacetime, that decided to abandon the single market and the customs union. They could have left the EU and stayed in the single market, like Norway. But they quit everything, solely for ideological reasons and political rhetoric. And today they are paying the price.What specific areas of cooperation do you see with London today? At least five or six: European security, the fight against terrorism, defense organization and financing, foreign policy, cooperation in Africa. To this I add two more with an economic dimension: energy and artificial intelligence. Could the UK then participate in the major European investment plans, especially in defense? Of course. Several companies are already Franco-British or Euro-British. It’s in our interest to cooperate in armament, industrial capacities and research. The United Kingdom already participates in certain European research programs. And I think that, given the Ukrainian crisis and the new U.S. attitude, it’s time to organize this cooperation politically. I propose the creation of a European Security Council. An intergovernmental body, outside the European Union’s institutions, that would include the United Kingdom and, for example, Norway. This Council would coordinate our common security and defense policy. It could bring together countries that so wish, starting with those that contribute the most to the European budget: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain.Is U.K. reintegration a medium-term option?It’s their decision. The door remains open. They can return to the customs union, to the single market, or even to full membership in the European Union. But they know the conditions. The further they move away from European rules in time and form, the harder it will be to return. Because you don’t return to the Union without accepting its rules.Do you want to play a role in the future presidential campaign? I’m not going to tell you I don’t have the ambition. When you’ve been prime minister, you’re always ready to serve.You can’t build a European coalition with extremes. In some countries, there may be local, temporary alliances, but at the European level, it would be a strategic and moral error. The values of the EPP are not compatible with those of Vox or the National Rally. A self-respecting right cannot ally itself with those who deny the rule of law, reject Europe, or sympathize with [Vladimir] Putin. This isn’t a tactical debate; it’s a question of political identity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Tariffs: Can the US and the EU Strike a Trade Deal?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC1Z51eJpnM</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QC1Z51eJpnM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 05:51:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maros Sefcovic, met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday.

Meta is accused of trying to eliminate competitors when it acquired Instagram and Whatsapp in 2012 and 2014. 
Authorities in the US say the only way to remedy the situation is for Meta to sell both companies. If Meta is found guilty, it will result in a corporate breakup the likes of which has not been seen since the telephone company AT&T was forced to give up its monopoly in the US 40 years ago.

Xi’s visit, marked by a 21-cannon salute, comes as China positions itself as a stable trade partner amid what it calls "erratic U.S. policy" under President Donald Trump. The U.S. recently imposed — and then paused — sweeping tariffs on countries including Vietnam, its top export partner. Xi urged Vietnam to uphold global supply chain stability and resist trade pressure. Meanwhile, Trump dismissed the talks, telling reporters: “I don’t blame China. I don’t blame Vietnam. They are trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America,” adding that the European Union “was formed to hurt the United States on trade.” Xi’s trip marks his first overseas visit of the year, aimed at countering U.S. influence.

Normally during a chaotic trading situation, anxious financiers run to what has long been the safest of investments: dollars and dollar assets, like U.S. government debt. That drives the value of the dollar up and the interest rate on debt down.Instead, we are seeing the opposite: The dollar is falling against other currencies, and interest rates on American debt are increasing. As yet, these movements are relatively modest, and may represent nothing more than chaos in the market. However, they do indicate a likely weakening of confidence in the stability and security of the dollar as a global reserve currency—which given Trump’s deranged behavior, ought to be expected. A country that elected a senile criminal madman  is not to be trusted.Wit that the European Union just might have a once-in-a-century opportunity to provide that stability and security to governments and investors, and swipe some or all of the dollar’s status. But it won’t happen automatically, and it will require permanently ditching the traditional European allergy to debt and printing money.A reserve currency, of course, is one that is used to settle international transactions. Today, the dollar makes up about 60 percent of foreign currency reserves; the euro about 20 percent. For years now, various people have predicted the collapse of the dollar, upset by the American addiction to cutting taxes on the rich and the resulting government borrowing. But in fact, this is one reason why the dollar is so useful, and a reason why nothing has replaced it. In order for a currency to be used internationally, it—or assets based on it—must be available in large quantities. Massive borrowing means trillions of dollar assets available around the world in the form of U.S. government bonds.That is why until now the American government could borrow cheaply despite its enormous debt. But as Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein explain in their book , this “exorbitant privilege” comes at a heavy cost. Structurally high demand for the dollar pushes up its value relative to other currencies, making American exports less competitive. This was a major factor, in addition to the low wages in the nations to which U.S. corporations offshored their production, behind American deindustrialization in the late 20th century. American elites compounded this problem with the neoliberal vogue for “structural adjustment” programs pushed on developing countries suffering currency crises. American-backed agencies like the IMF and the World Bank would sweep in and demand austerity in exchange for a bailout, causing those countries to accumulate massive dollar hoards to protect themselves—pushing up the exchange rate further.The vast, probably multitrillion-euro EU rearmament and reinvestment effort currently under way could be financed essentially for free.Running a reserve currency also comes with responsibilities. During the 2008 financial crisis, and again during the COVID pandemic, the Federal Reserve let central banks in Germany, France, Switzerland, the U.K., Japan, and other nations use its “swap line” facilities, through which they could exchange their currencies for dollars—essentially granting them access to the dollar printing press, at a modest price. Close U.S. allies could thereby rely on the dollar, knowing that if a general crisis struck, the Fed would serve as a global lender of last resort, and stave off a general currency crisis.All that may sound like displacing the dollar is a bad move. Actually, it would come with many benefits, and there are strategies the EU could use if it steps up to position the euro as the reserve currency that could help it avoid damaging its own industrial base. Besides, if the dollar does fall,  has to replace it, and better the EU than anyone else.How to go about it? Silvia Merler outlines the basic idea at Bruegel (an economic think tank based in Belgium). The key strategy would be to issue a lot of EU bonds; rather than individual member countries borrowing, the debt would be backed by the union as a whole. Then, rather than spending the money on tax cuts for the rich as America has done, plow it into the ongoing EU military buildup.Indeed, the EU has already issued such bonds during the pandemic to the tune of €600 billion, with another €150 billion as part of an EU rearmament program, and demand is high. “On a weighted average, EU bond issuance has been 8.3-times oversubscribed since 2020, and yields remain lower than those paid by most EU members—signaling a structurally strong demand for EU debt,” Merler writes. They would be even more attractive if they were based on some kind of fiscal union (not just the monetary union that currently exists), which could begin with a small tax paid by all countries into a central pot. But a third of the pandemic-era bonds are set to expire soon, more than offsetting the new debt. To replace dollars, many, many more euro-based assets—likely into the trillions—will be needed.This might even be a wise step for European self-protection. Should a global financial crisis develop, leading to a panicked stampede for anything that seems safe, people will likely buy up any euro cash or euro-based asset they can find, driving its value through the roof.Additionally, the European Central Bank would be wise to set up its own swap lines, and make them formal and explicit rather than opaque and ad hoc like those at the Fed. This would alleviate anxiety among eligible nations so they don’t have to build up defensive euro hoards and push up the currency’s value, damaging EU exporters.There would be stiff political obstacles to accomplishing this, of course. Europeans, especially Germans, are historically allergic to borrowing and printing money, much less fiscal union.

The vast, probably multitrillion-euro EU rearmament and reinvestment effort currently under way could be financed essentially for free, and the EU would take its rightful place as the leader of the free world.It took many years for the dollar to get where it is. During the 19th century, the British pound sterling was the reserve currency, and it took the American economy growing far larger than Britain’s, plus two shattering world wars, for the dollar to displace it. Now, Donald Trump may well be doing the work of a century of economic upheaval and Hitlerian destruction in a matter of weeks. But America’s catastrophic self-inflicted loss may be Europe’s gain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>El Salvador&apos;s Bukele says he can&apos;t return wrongly deported man to US | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwPbZvYt5Vs</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HwPbZvYt5Vs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:05:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he had no plans to return a man mistakenly deported from the United States as he met with President Donald Trump at the White House.

Bukele said. "I don't have the power to return him to the United States."Top Trump administration officials at the same meeting suggested they would not comply with Xinis' demand that officials facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, despite the district and Supreme Court orders.The Trump administration claims the married father of three is a gang member, pointing to a 2019 statement by a U.S. immigration judge.U.S. Reps. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., at left, and Juan Vargas, D-Calif., hold pictures of Kilmar Abrego Garcia during a news conference to discuss Abrego Garcia’s arrest and deportation, at the Cannon House Office Building in Washington, April 9, 2025.The administration also argues it has no legal responsibility to get him backOn Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld Xinis' original order that the administration "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return but asked her to clarify it.Xinis quickly did so, and on Friday told the Trump administration to give her daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia and about its efforts to get him back.Bukele suggested he would not send Abrego Garcia to the U.S. even if Trump asked. "I mean, we're not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country," the Salvadoran president said."We just turned the murder capital of the world into the safest country in the Western Hemisphere and you want us to go back into releasing criminals so we can go back to being the murder capital of the world?" Bukele said."That's not going to happen."Trump then said that the media would "love" to have criminals released into the U.S., adding that the media are "sick people."He also said he wants Bukele to accept as many criminals as possible.After insulting the CNN reporter who asked about Abrego Garcia, Trump had tossed the question about his return to Attorney General Pam Bondi.Bondi said Abrego Garcia — who has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S. — had been determined in the courts to be a member of the gang MS-13 who was in the country illegally.Xinis has said there is no evidence that he is a gang member."That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us," Bondi said.She said the Supreme Court's ruling on Abrego Garcia only requires that the Trump administration "facilitate" his return, "meaning provide a plane," if El Salvador decides to return him.Trump then asked top White House advisor Stephen Miller to weigh in."He's a citizen of El Salvador," Miller said. "So it's very arrogant, even, for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens."Secretary of State Marco Rubio nodded along at Miller's interpretation of the Supreme Court's ruling.After Bukele said he would not release Abrego Garcia, Rubio said, "I don't understand what the confusion is.""This individual is a citizen of El Salvador," Rubio said. "He was illegally in the United States and was returned to his country. That's where you deport people back to their country of origin.""The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the President of the United States, not by a court," Rubio said. "And no court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy in the United States, it's that simple. End of story."When the CNN reporter attempted to ask Trump a follow-up question, the president replied, "How long do we have to answer this question from you?""Why don't you just say: Isn't it wonderful that we're keeping criminals out of our country?" Trump said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Back to Russian gas?

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, he said: “The mistake was letting the war happen, if Biden were competent, and if Zelensky were competent, and I don’t know that he is, we had a rough session with this guy [Zelensky]. “He just kept asking for more and more that war should have never been allowed to happen. That war, I went four years and Putin wouldn’t even bring it up. And as soon as the election was rigged, and I wasn’t here, that war started. There was no way that war should have been allowed to happen, and Biden should have stopped it.”Asked if he spoke to the Ukrainian about his offer to purchase more Patriot missiles, he added: “Listen, when you start a war, you got to know that you can win the war, right? You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump welcomes El Salvador&apos;s President Nayib Bukele to the White House</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxmqXXPM_r4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gxmqXXPM_r4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:14:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump is hosting Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a critical lynchpin of the U.S. administration’s mass deportation operation.

Denmark recorded one of the sharpest drops, which could be linked to Trump’s widely criticized proposal for the US to take ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory.Travel from Ireland, Germany, and Norway saw even more dramatic drops—each plummeting by more than 20%, according to ITA figures cited by the .Worst Decline Since Pandemic-Era ChaosIn total, overseas travel to the US dropped by 12% last month compared to March 2024 figures, marking the sharpest monthly decline since 2021. That year, the global travel industry was still reeling from pandemic-related restrictions. Experts now suggest the current downturn stems directly from Trump’s political and economic stance.Experts Point to “Reputation Damage”“In just two months [Trump] has destroyed the reputation of the US, shown one way by diminished travel from the EU to the US,” said Paul English, co-founder of travel website Kayak. “This is not only one more terrible blow to the US economy, it also represents reputation damage that could take generations to repair.”Adam Sacks, president at Tourism Economics, added: “It’s very clear something is happening . . . and it is a reaction to Trump.” He pointed to data from US airports and land crossings from Canada as evidence of the shift.Airlines and Hotels Feel the ImpactTransatlantic routes, long considered among the most profitable for airlines, are now feeling the squeeze. Virgin Atlantic warned of a “modest” slowdown in demand last week, while Air France-KLM’s CEO Ben Smith said the airline had slashed economy-class transatlantic fares due to a “slight softness” in the market.Sébastien Bazin, chief executive of French hotel group Accor, blamed border detentions for generating a “bad buzz” around travel to the US. He told  that European bookings for US destinations had dropped 25% this summer.Personal Stories Reflect Growing ConcernGloria Sync, an artist from England, canceled her trip to San Francisco scheduled for May after hearing reports of detained tourists. “The borders seem unsafe,” said Sync, who is transgender. “I don’t know if I’ll ever go back, to be honest,” she added, citing concerns about “unwanted attention” at the border.Paul Harrington, a British retiree living in Paris, also scrapped his upcoming trip to Washington DC. “I am now contacting my US friends to visit me in Paris,” he said. “I will not visit the States until Trump is gone.” Harrington pointed to Trump’s tariffs and the dismantling of the US foreign aid agency USAID as reasons for his decision.Canadians Also Staying AwayIt’s not just Europeans. Visits from Canada have also declined, with travel analysts tying the trend to Trump’s divisive approach. “These are all unforced errors, and they have a significant effect on sentiment towards the US, and therefore travel,” Sacks said.As travel demand sours, especially on once-thriving transatlantic routes, the ripple effects could hit US airlines, hotels, and local economies hard. The steep drop in European travel presents a serious warning to a sector already grappling with post-pandemic recovery—and the numbers suggest the damage may not be easily reversed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hungary passes a constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ public events</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/hungary-pride-ban-amendment-orban-gay-rights-lgbtq-155ec12cbbde7cc6be0f96adb323de77</link><author>/u/Throwsims3</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:42:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Prayer service near White House for Kilmar Abrego Garcia</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSXxL3e6Uvo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LSXxL3e6Uvo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:33:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[People gather for a prayer service for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as US President Donald Trump prepares to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a leader praised by the administration for opening his country's prison system to alleged gang members and detainees Trump wants out of the United States. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was sent to El Salvador's so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, on March 15 despite an order protecting him from deportation, has drawn particular attention. The Supreme Court upheld an order directing the administration to "facilitate and effectuate" his return but said the term "effectuate" was unclear and might exceed her authority.

He is an influential figure in the MAGA world with ties to people in Trump’s orbit, including former Congressman Matt Gaetz and Elon Musk. His crackdown on El Salvador’s gangs has inspired many in the U.S. conservative movement, and he has even become a key player in Trump’s mass deportation strategy.

I tried to explain, ‘You can’t look for something in the middle. There is an aggressor and there is a victim. The Russians are the aggressor, and we are the victim,’” he added.In response, Vance’s press secretary Taylor Van Kirk said Zelenskyy’s comments “are counterproductive to the goal of achieving peace for his country.”“Instead of mischaracterizing Vice President Vance’s rhetoric, President Zelenskyy should be focused on bringing this conflict to a peaceful conclusion,” the statement adds.During the infamous White House meeting, Zelenskyy urged Vance to visit his country to survey the damage inflicted by Russia across Ukraine.“I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President,” Vance shot back at the time.Zelenskyy, the Trump administration’s criticism of him, including the president calling him a “dictator,” reflects “the enormous influence of Russia’s information policy on America, on U.S. politics, and U.S. politicians,” according to the translation provided by CBS. Elections have been suspended in Ukraine due to the war.The wartime leader has extended an invitation to Trump to visit Ukraine before engaging in further negotiations to broker peace between the two countries.“Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,” he told CBS’ Scott Pelley. “Come, look, and then let’s — let’s move with a plan how to finish the war.”Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin on Friday in Russia as Trump called on Moscow to “get moving.”“Too many people [are] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war,” he wrote on Truth Social.Witkoff’s meeting with Putin lasted for over four hours, according to the Kremlin.Zelenskyy, who conceded he hates Putin, told Pelley the Russian president can’t be trusted, as he laid out what was at stake in this critical juncture in the war.“Putin’s ultimate goal is to revive the Russian Empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection,” Zelenskyy said, according to CBS’ translation. “And the United States being part of NATO means it will be involved in any potential conflict. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.”Trump lashed out at CBS on Sunday evening following the broadcast of the “60 Minutes” episode. He, once again, said the Ukraine war would have never started if he were in charge, before calling for the network to lose its license.“They are not a ‘News Show,’” the president wrote, “but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing.”We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Ukrainian officials said cluster munitions exploded in midair, killing 34 people—including two children—and injuring at least 117.Instead of condemning the strikes, Trump suggested the attack was unintentional. “I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake,” he told reporters Sunday on Air Force One. “But I think it’s a horrible thing. I think the whole war’s a horrible thing.”He then launched into a 90-second monologue about how if the 2020 election hadn’t been “rigged” and he had been president in 2022, when Russia invaded, “We wouldn’t have had the war in Ukraine.” Even then he couldn’t bring himself to use the active voice or name the aggressors. He didn’t once say the name “Putin,” and the one time he used the word “Russia” was to describe the war as the “Russia-Ukraine situation.” “This country would have never allowed that war to have started if I were president,” he said. “That war is a shame. Millions of people are dead that should be alive, cities are being destroyed all over Ukraine, the whole culture is gone—or very certainly very severely hurt.” Although the war has been devastating, the death toll appears to be much lower than the “millions” that Trump cited.The best estimates put Ukrainian troop casualties at about 80,000 and Russian losses at up to 200,000, according to the . About 60,000 Ukrainian civilians have died or gone missing, not including more than 19,500 children forcibly deported to Russia, according to the . Hundreds of thousands of people have also been injured and millions have been displaced. Asked to clarify his comment that the Sumy attack was a “mistake” in the sense that it was “unintentional,” Trump said, “They made a mistake—I believe it was—look you gotta ask them.” “This is Biden’s war. This is not my war,” he added during another 40-second rant that, again, did not include the words “Russia” or “Putin.” “That war would have never taken place,” he repeated. “But remember this: This is Biden’s war.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia &apos;mocking&apos; US ceasefire efforts by attacks on Sumy, Kryvyi Rih, Polish FM says</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/polish-fm-slams-russian-attacks-urges-trump-to-see-putins-mockery-of-ceasefire-efforts/</link><author>/u/AdSpecialist6598</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:39:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on April 14 condemned Russia’s recent deadly attacks on Ukrainian cities, accusing Moscow of mocking U.S.-led ceasefire efforts and escalating violence despite Ukraine’s commitment to peace."I just want to say how appalled I am by the latest spate of Russian attacks on Ukraine," the minister said upon arrival at a European Union foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg."Ukraine unconditionally agreed to a ceasefire over a month ago. The heinous attacks on Kryvyi Rih and Sumy are Russia's mocking answer."A Russian strike on Sumy on April 13 killed at least 34 people and injured 119. U.S. President Trump called the attack a "horrible thing" but suggested it may have been a "mistake," without elaborating.Another Russian strike on Kryvyi Rih on April 4 killed 20 people, including nine children, and injured over 70.Sikorski urged Trump and his administration to take action, saying, "I hope that President Trump, the U.S. administration see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill, and I hope the right decisions are taken."The comments come more than a month after Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire during talks in Jeddah on March 11. The proposal required mutual agreement, but Russia rejected it unless foreign military support to Ukraine was halted, a condition Kyiv has deemed unacceptable.Though a narrower agreement was reached on March 25 to suspend attacks on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea, that truce has largely failed to hold. The Kremlin has linked its implementation of the Black Sea truce to the lifting of some Western sanctions, while both Ukraine and Russia accuse each other of violating the energy ceasefire.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also condemned the Sumy strike, saying Europe can only secure peace through collective strength."The horrific attack on Sumy shows once again that the Russian president continues to seek the destruction of Ukraine – and with it, continues his attack on European peace," Baerbock said in Luxembourg. "It is now clear: whoever wants peace must protect Ukraine, must support Ukraine."Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys called the Sumy attack "barbaric" and a "war crime," urging the EU to move forward with a 17th sanctions package against Moscow."(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is once again challenging everyone — especially those dedicating their time for a good reason," Budrys said.Austria’s Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger stressed that Ukraine has shown willingness for peace, while "Russia continues the war with brutality. We want peace — but not a dictated one."Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said recent attacks prove "Russia does not want peace" and called for more pressure on Moscow and stronger support for Ukraine, including action on frozen Russian assets.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot condemned the Sumy attack as a "Palm Sunday massacre," calling it evidence of Putin’s disregard for civilian lives and international law. "Putin must be constrained," Barrot said. "The EU must impose the harshest sanctions, and the U.S. should reinforce pressure if peace is to be achieved."Since the March 11 proposal, Russia has launched 70 missiles, 2,200 Shahed drones, and 6,000 guided aerial bombs against Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on April 11.Despite U.S.-led diplomatic efforts, Russia has continued to list maximalist demands in negotiations and has shown little willingness to move toward a comprehensive peace deal. Ukrainian officials say Kyiv remains committed to a full ceasefire if Moscow agrees to do the same.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Map of high schools in Istanbul uprising against the Erdogan regime</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jyxqws/map_of_high_schools_in_istanbul_uprising_against/</link><author>/u/turkish__cowboy</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:34:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bangkok celebrates Thai New Year</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd5Y6gcBgYo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cd5Y6gcBgYo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:30:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of revelers, including foreign tourists armed with plastic water guns, flooded Bangkok’s streets to celebrate Thailand’s traditional New Year in the sweltering April heat.

The dollar weakened to a six-month low on concern that the confusion around the Trump administration’s tariff policy will drive traders away from US assets. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index rallied, while futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 advanced at least 1.5%. Apple shares jumped in premarket trading. The late Friday tech tariff exemption is temporary and a part of the longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. Trump doubled down on the plan Sunday. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said in a social media post Sunday. Our big guest of the morning - famed economist Nouriel Roubini on everything trade, tariffs and markets. 

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

The administration on Friday exempted phones, computers and chips from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. But the President added that no-one is 'off the hook,' pledging that he will still apply tariffs to popular consumer electronics — making the reprieve seem temporary and part of the longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. 

This comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping has started his sweep across Southeast Asia with a visit to one of the countries hardest hit by the shakeup of global trade: Vietnam. Xi Jinping's trip is seen as an attempt to form alliances against the US in the trade war. 

Meanwhile, Bloomberg understands that the US and Iran are expected to hold their second round of nuclear talks on Saturday in Rome. It follows their first meeting in years in Oman over the weekend.

He has, however, paused for 90 days an additional "reciprocal" rate on U.S. trading partners to give time for trade negotiations, such as those about to take place with Japan.Separately, Trump imposed a 25-percent tariff on foreign steel, aluminum, and autos, which remains in place.Goods trade with Japan was worth $227.9 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).U.S. goods exports to Japan in 2024 were $79.7 billion, with trade the other way worth $148.2 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $68.5 billion for the U.S.Trump points to America's trade deficits as evidence of an imbalanced and unfair relationship, and is using tariffs to force negotiations on new terms.Japan's trade profile with the U.S. is concentrated in exports of automobiles and high-tech electronics, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.Top U.S. exports to Japan include liquefied natural gas, pharmaceutical preparations, meat and poultry, industrial machines, medicines and medical equipment, civilian aircraft, engines and parts, and corn.Japan maintains relatively lower tariffs overall, but protects sectors like agriculture and leather goods through non-tariff barriers and quotas identified in the USTR's 2024 National Trade Estimate report.In March, Trump spoke critically of a long-standing security treaty that obliges the U.S. to defend Japan if it comes under attack, in exchange for allowing American bases on Japanese soil. Tokyo must also defend the U.S. if it is attacked in a Japanese territory.While Ishiba has not proposed altering the pact, tensions around tariffs and strategic partnerships remain intertwined.Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday: "I'm not of the view that we should make big concessions for the sake of wrapping up negotiations quickly…In negotiating with the United States, we need to understand what's behind Trump's argument both in terms of the logic and the emotional elements behind his views."Riley Walters, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute research organization, wrote in March: "U.S.-Japan negotiations will be an interesting case study. In some ways, other governments can learn how to negotiate with the Trump administration on trade and economic matters."But the relationship between the U.S. and Japan is also unique. Most countries do not share the same level of economic, security, or political relations that exist between the U.S. and Japan."U.S.-Japan trade talks begin on Thursday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Protest in Hungary against ban on LGBTQ+ Pride events</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUC_1z7sPUw</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XUC_1z7sPUw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:58:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Protesters rally outside the Hungarian parliament as lawmakers vote on a constitutional amendment that would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities.

It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s security or sovereignty.

There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,” he said, adding that Americans can look forward to “more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us” as a result of his agenda.Trump also said that the National Security Tariff Investigations will be reviewing “the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.”Correspondingly, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that semiconductor tariffs were “not really an exception,” in an interview on CBS News’ “Face The Nation.“We certainly need to have semiconductors, and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is- it’s not really an exception. That’s not even the right word for it,” Greer said. “So, it’s not that they won’t be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They’ll just be under a different regime. It’s shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.”On the other hand, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump’s tariff exemption on imported electronics is only temporary.According to Lutnick in a Sunday interview on “This Week” with Jonathan Karl, electronics will be included in semiconductor tariffs, which will likely be enforced within a month or two. Trump, Greer and Lutnick’s remarks on Sunday come in direct contrast with communication from U.S. Customs and Border Protection late on Friday that claimed imported electronics, such as smartphones, laptops and more, would be exempt from Trump’s tariffs.“We can’t be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need,” Lutnick added. “So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. [Trump is] just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries. These are things that are national security that we need to be made in America.”The exemption would have been great news for big tech companies that manufacture many of their products abroad — as Apple does in China. According to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, “These companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.”“President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That’s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia,” Leavitt said in the statement, according to CNN on Saturday. The news is the latest in Trump’s tariff back and forth with dozens of other countries. Trump announced a bulk of his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on April 2, a day which he dubbed “Liberation Day.” Days later, however, he then implemented a 90-day pause on the Liberation Day tariffs, leaving behind a basic 10% tariff on most countries. But Trump has put 145% tariffs on China.People in the business world took to social media in response to Lutnick’s interview and Trump’s ever-evolving tariff policies, according to Mediaite.Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino said on X that CEOs and investors he has talked to have called Trump’s tariff policies “a sad, scary and at times, silly spectacle.”“Plus they will say Howard Lutnick is a horrible spokesman for whatever trade regime the White House comes up with,” Gasparino added.We Don't Work For Billionaires.

If this was serious industrial policy, the main thing you want is certainty: ‘Here’s the tariff, it will be in place for the indefinite future, and you should plan accordingly,’” Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank, said, according to The Washington Post. “Here, it’s basically: ‘Come back next week and see what we’ve got.’ That’s no way to run an economy.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Israel-Gaza border seen from southern Israel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfq8N8ij7tY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Dfq8N8ij7tY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 08:43:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A view of the Israel-Gaza border seen from southern Israel.

Xi will hold talks with Vietnam's prime minister and he's expected to urge a coordinated response to President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Trump hit Vietnam with a tariff rate of 46 percent, but that has been paused for 90 days. Vietnam is a key player in the supply chain that delivers products to the US. Many companies shifted production there after Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese firms during his first term as president.

Alison Hicks, an associate professor in library and information studies at UCL, interviewed 10 UK-based school librarians who had experienced book challenges. One “spoke of finding propaganda from one of these groups left on her desk”, while another “was directly targeted by one of these groups”. Respondents “also spoke of being trolled by US pressure groups on social media, for example when responding to free book giveaways”.It is “certainly possible that the scale of censorship we’re seeing in the US will influence the debate over here”, said Jewell. However, the level of influence to date is far from clear, particularly because the nature of censorship requests in the UK seems to differ from those brought forward in the US.Censorship by pupils in UK schools, including “vandalising library material, annotating library books with racist and homophobic slurs”, and damaging posters and displays was identified in Hicks’ study, which she wrote about in the spring issue of the SLA’s journal, The School Librarian. Such censorship “is not something I have seen in the US”, she said.The types of books targeted may also differ. “Almost all the UK attacks reported in my study centred on LGBTQ+ materials, while US attacks appear to target material related to race, ethnicity and social justice as well as LGBTQ+ issues,” said Hicks.While the study was small, the “LGBTQ focus of book challenges was undeniable”, wrote Hicks. Challenges were levelled against Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper series, about the love story of two British schoolboys, and “coded” narratives in books such as Billy’s Bravery by Tom Percival, about a boy who wants to dress up as his favourite superhero, Nature Girl.This supports the findings of an Index on Censorship survey last year, in which 28 of 53 librarians polled reported that they had been asked to remove books from library shelves, many of which were LGBTQ+ titles. In more than half of those cases, books were taken off shelves.However, a 2023 study by Cilip, which found that a third of UK librarians had been asked by members of the public to censor or remove books, did identify themes of race and empire as among the most targeted, along with LGBTQ+.While there may be differences in how the challenges are playing out, “this should not take away from the huge impact these attacks are having” in the UK, said Hicks. “My research demonstrates that UK school librarians are facing equivalent levels of distress and hostility in the face of book ban challenges such as these.”In the US, book banning measures have been enacted across a number of states in recent years. “Library leaders in the UK are paying close attention to what’s happening in the US and there’s definitely a strong feeling of solidarity with American librarians,” said Jewell. Coiffait-Gunn of Cilip added that the profession “looks on with deep concern at the increasingly polarised and political debate” in the US about “what people, especially children, are allowed to read”.One cause for concern in the UK is the “lack of robust evidence” about how widespread censorship is, said Coiffait-Gunn. “It’s hard to evidence what doesn’t happen and which books are not available.” The government does not tally how many school libraries or librarians there are, “let alone track book bans”.Most UK libraries follow the Cilip ethical framework, which states that published materials should not be restricted on any grounds but the law, said Jewell. “That gives them the confidence and assurance to reject demands” for censorship.“What we must guard against is a climate where libraries avoid stocking certain books – or holding talks or activities – for fear of negative publicity, threats or intimidation,” he added. “It’s vital that libraries feel able to provide access to a wide range of perspectives if they are to facilitate the free exchange of ideas.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech stocks lift Asian markets, but confusion reigns over US tariffs | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfayc08Oo1U</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zfayc08Oo1U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:38:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shares in Asian tech companies that are major suppliers to companies like Apple rose after the US government granted temporary exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China

And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing," Trump told reporters on board Air Force One while headed back to Washington.Asked to clarify what he meant by a "mistake," Trump said that "they made a mistake... you're gonna ask them" -- without specifying who or what he meant.The American leader's National Security Council (NSC) had earlier Sunday called the Russian strike "a clear and stark reminder of why President Donald Trump's efforts to try and end this terrible war comes at a crucial time."Neither Trump nor the White House named Moscow as the perpetrator of the attack, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier offered condolences to the "victims of today's horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy."The Sumy strike came two days after US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and push Trump's efforts to end the war. Zelensky on Sunday urged the US president to visit his country to better understand the devastation wrought by Russia's invasion."Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead," the Ukrainian leader said in an interview broadcast on US network CBS.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Daniel Noboa is reelected Ecuador&apos;s president by voters weary of crime</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6SA4WmpXMw</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q6SA4WmpXMw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 06:30:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ecuadorian voters weary of crime reelected President Daniel Noboa, a conservative young millionaire with a divisive no-holds-barred crime-fighting record, by a wide margin Sunday, but his opponent vowed to seek a recount over what she described as “grotesque” electoral fraud.

He faces serious charges of orchestrating a rebellion and has been accused of serving as the "ringleader of an insurrection."
Yoon arrived at the Seoul courthouse in a convoy, greeted by a crowd of cheering supporters gathered outside. He was impeached last December after declaring martial law and allegedly ordering South Korean troops to storm the National Assembly.
Under South Korean law, the crime of insurrection carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or even death. Yoon has denied all allegations, defending his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance.

It will not be theater.""You can go exactly where you want, in any city which (has) been under attacks."Trump is pushing for a quick end to the more than three-year war, with the United States holding direct talks with Russia despite its unrelenting attacks on Ukraine.Washington has also held talks with Ukrainian officials on a potential truce, while European nations are discussing a military deployment to reinforce any Ukraine ceasefire.Kyiv has previously agreed to a US-proposed unconditional ceasefire but Moscow has turned it down."Putin can't be trusted. I told that to President Trump many times. So when you ask why the ceasefire isn't working -- this is why," Zelensky said."Putin never wanted an end to the war. Putin never wanted us to be independent. Putin wants to destroy us completely -- our sovereignty and our people."Zelensky spoke to CBS Friday in his hometown Kryvyi Rig, where a Russian strike earlier this month killed 18 people, including nine children.The Ukrainian leader said he had "100 percent hatred" for Putin, asking "how else can you see a person who came here and murdered our people, murdered children?"However he added that the animosity "doesn't mean we shouldn't work to end the war as soon as possible."As negotiations continue over ending the war, Zelensky said that a just peace would be "to not lose our sovereignty or our independence," and pledged to eventually reclaim any territory currently held by Russia."We, no matter what, will take back what is ours because we never lost it -- the Russians took it from us."(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Says He&apos;s Exploring Tariffs on Chips</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYEsGj_cLjU</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lYEsGj_cLjU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 03:05:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that certain electronics are still subject to existing tariffs of 20% and that the administration is looking into levies on the whole supply chain for the goods.

Eric Lombard said the measure would be part of efforts to find €40 billion next year, mainly from savings, to bring the public deficit to 4.6% of GDP in 2026.Lombard said tens of thousands of French high earners would have to pay more each year as the country battles a debt mountain that has worried markets and ratings agencies. Individuls earning more than €250,000 a year and couples with a joint income of more than €500,000 will this year pay a minimum 20% income tax. The government said last year that the special "contribution" would be temporary. But Lombard told France's BFMTV: "I hope that this contribution will be lasting," adding that it had brought in €2 billion for 2024.His ministry had started work to "verify that the mechanisms which allow the reduction" of taxes for the wealthiest "work in a more equitable manner," he added, also noting that special tax on major companies that brought in €8 billion would not be repeated."On the other hand, the two billion contribution from the high-revenue earners... we want to work on this, either maintain it or improve it," he said. It was "a question of financial resources – two billion is a lot – and a question of fairness. We are asking a big effort from everyone," said the minister, who insisted it would only be a tax on revenues.Lombard's office told AFP that the aim of the new measure would be "to combat tax over-optimization." France is "on budget alert," Lombard told French television station BFMTV, blaming the country's "cumulative deficits." The €40 billion cut in spending would focus "mainly" on "savings," he added, but "it could also be an increase in revenues linked to growth."France's debt rose by €202.7 billion to €3.3 trillion last year, accounting for 113% of GDP, according to the official statistics agency and Lombard has acknowledged that this was a threat to France's financial stability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bernie Sanders makes surprise appearance at Coachella 2025 music festival</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzAJ3OhJmJk</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BzAJ3OhJmJk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:30:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders made a surprise appearance at the Coachella music festival Saturday night in Indio, California.
