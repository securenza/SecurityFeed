Speaking during a visit to Egypt, Macron added that he thought the tariffs were a bad idea and France would retaliate.

The Ministry urges Chinese nationals to carefully assess safety risks and increase their awareness of potential challenges when selecting U.S. states, particularly those affected by the new restrictions.The ministry's alert, issued on Wednesday, highlights concerns over the worsening China-U.S. economic and trade relations, as well as the domestic security situation in the U.S. It advises Chinese tourists to carefully evaluate the risks of traveling to the U.S. and exercise caution.The move follows steep declines in global markets, driven by growing concerns that the trade war could cause widespread economic damage well beyond the U.S. and China.In April, President Trump imposed tariffs on numerous American trading partners, prompting many to retaliate with their own measures.The updated travel guidance by China comes as Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Germany, France and the U.K. have all issued new travel guidance for those wishing to travel to the U.S. in response to President Trump's crackdown on immigration and trans rights.Beijing's motivation is centered around the opening rounds of a renewed trade war with the U.S.China announced it will raise tariffs on U.S. imports to 84 percent in response to President Donald Trump's latest tariff hike on Chinese goods, adding 50 percent to the previous rate of 34 percent, after Trump's increase to 104 percent as of Wednesday.Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries went into effect on Wednesday.These new duties, announced on April 2 during a speech from the White House Rose Garden, are in addition to the 10 percent tariff the president imposed on all global imports starting on April 5.The administration claims the measure will address long-standing global trade imbalances that have hurt the U.S. and encourage companies to move their manufacturing operations to the country.President Trump said in a speech to the NRCC on Tuesday night: "After all of the abuses they've perpetrated, China is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs...That's why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place, effective midnight tonight, at 104 percent."Until they make a deal with us, that's what it's going to be. I think they'll make a deal with us at some point. China will. They want to make a deal, they really do...they just don't know how to get it started.""The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system," China's finance ministry said in a statement.There are no indications that the U.S.-China trade dispute will deescalate anytime soon, with both sides maintaining a firm stance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China Is Only Country Escalating on Trade, Says Treasury Secretary Bessent</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf3gvEnUSY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UJf3gvEnUSY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 14:16:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the only country escalating when it comes to tariffs is China.

China has called for the world to unite against Trump's tariffs as the country's exporters reel from the crippling new levies. "Global unity can triumph over trade tyranny," declared an editorial in the state-run newspaper China Daily, noting Beijing's collaborations with Japan, South Korea and other Asian economies. A separate piece called for the European Union to work with it to "uphold free trade and multilateralism". Beijing "firmly opposes and will never accept such hegemonic and bullying practices," foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Wednesday. The tariffs come at a difficult time for China's sluggish economy: domestic consumption remains weak and exports are still a major driver of growth. The sweeping nature of Trump's tariffs has also left Chinese businesses scrambling to adjust their supply chains - with most countries affected, firms say it's hard to find a way out of this uncertainty.The tariffs will shrink "already razor-thin profit margins", said the owner of a Chinese business that handles cross-border logistics for e-commerce, as well as air and sea freight. He did not wish to share his name."Higher tariffs raise costs for freight forwarders like us, as well as for factories, companies, and sellers. It just means everyone earns less."Watch: Trump says tariffs will be 'legendary' ahead of 104% tax on ChinaAny tariff upwards of 35% will wipe out all the profits that Chinese businesses make when exporting to the US or South East Asia, said Dan Wang from the Eurasia Group consultancy."Growth is going to be much lower since exports contributed to 20% to 50% of growth since the Covid pandemic," she added. The Chinese government has not announced retaliatory measures but Beijing is reportedly considering banning Hollywood films and suspending fentanyl cooperation with the US, according to Chinese blogger Liu Hong, who is a senior editor at state-run Xinhua news.But that would offer little comfort to firms like Fuling, which sells disposable tableware to US fast food restaurants like McDonald's and Wendy's.It said the additional tariffs will "significantly impact" its business. Fuling noted that nearly two-thirds of the company's revenue in 2023 and the first half of last year came from the US.To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Fuling, which is headquartered in China's Zhejiang province, started a new factory in Indonesia late last year. But Trump's new tariffs have introduced more uncertainty for Chinese exports from Indonesia are now subject to a 32% levy, the company said in a corporate filing. Indonesia was hit along with much of the world in President Trump's announcement of expansive tariffs last week, which he claimed would allow the US economy to flourish. But economists have warned of a US and global recession. The tariffs have also shaken world markets and drawn criticism from billionaire CEOs, including Trump's ally Elon Musk. Trump's import taxes include a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US, and higher custom tariffs for what he calls the "worst offenders". These include Cambodia (49%), Vietnam (46%) and Thailand (36%), developing economies that have benefited from strong exports.  After Beijing announced tit-for-tat tariffs, Trump raised the levies on Chinese imports, more than doubling them to 104%. The owner of the logistics firm told the BBC he is holding out hope that China will be able to negotiate away some of these taxes: "Only when a final decision is made can we plan our next steps."While China has left the door open for talks, Trump has not spoken to Chinese leader Xi Jinping since returning to the White House.Such broad, sweeping tariffs will cause more harm than good, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said in a note to its member companies on Wednesday. "This level of upheaval is unprecedented, and it remains unclear how the current measures will benefit consumers in either nation or the broader economy," read the note signed by Chair Alvin Liu and President Michael Hart.Some analysts believe the levies will force China to restructure its economy and rely heavily on domestic consumption, which it has been struggling to boost. Otherwise, the tariffs will not be sustainable for China in the longer term, Tim Waterer from brokerage KCM Trade said.  "The tariffs are aimed at suppressing China," said the manager of a Chinese freight company, who asked to remain anonymous.He added that many of the South East Asian countries that have been hit with steep tariffs are "exactly where many Chinese businesses have relocated", such as Vietnam and Cambodia. The Tianjin-based company plans to negotiate with some of its American clients to share the burden of the tariffs. "Every case is different, but overall, the impact has been quite substantial," he said. Another freight company manager Wu Changchun, whose firm mainly operates on shipping routes between China and Cambodia, said he is already seeing a fall in freight volume. Several construction projects in Cambodia have also come to a halt after Trump's tariffs announcement, he said."If the tariffs were at 10% or 20%, businesses might still be able to absorb the cost by optimising supply chains, cutting margins and sharing the burden. Trade could still go on... [But at 104%] that's no longer something trade-offs can fix," said Mr Wu, a general manager at Maritima Maruba."That's full-on decoupling. Trade would basically come to a standstill."Additional reporting by Annabelle Liang ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Jared Isaacman’s confirmation hearing to lead NASA</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoV10JoaSFM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XoV10JoaSFM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 12:18:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as Jared Isaacman, President Donald Trump’s nominee for administrator of NASA, appears before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Most critically, the president plans to forge ahead with what would amount to a 104% levy on many Chinese goods. A selloff in longer-dated US Treasuries accelerated, worsening the slump in bond equivalents across the globe, as an escalation in the trade war sowed doubts over the haven status of US government debt. Every sector in Europe was down at the market open, but drugmakers are the biggest decliners so far after Trump’s comments that the US would be “announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals”.  The Stoxx 600 Health Care Index has dropped to the lowest since October 2022. Weight-loss and diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk slumped along with AstraZeneca, GSK stocks also falling.

More than one million Rohingya are sheltering in Bangladesh after fleeing persecution in neighboring Myanmar. Many rely on the World Food Programme to survive. With a 40 percent slump in donations last year – and no guaranteed future funding – the agency fears it will be forced to slash its food rations. DW visited the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazar to meet families who rely on that food, and who now fear for their future.

US President Donald Trump's ‘reciprocal’ tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104% duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war and spurring more widespread selling across financial markets. 

Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and wiped trillions of dollars off the market value of major firms.

According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. exported $143.5 billion of goods to China in 2024, while importing products worth $438.9 billion.The Trump administration announced a sweeping new tariff policy last week, warning other countries not to retaliate. Some nations, including Japan, have seemed willing to negotiate on tariffs, but China appears to be taking a more hard-line stance and quickly announced a countertariff.After China's initial response to the April 2 tariff rollout, Trump announced an additional 50% hike, putting the total level for import taxes on Chinese goods at 104%."It's unfortunate that the Chinese actually don't want to come and negotiate, because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Wednesday after China's latest announcement. "They have the most imbalanced economy in the history of the modern world, and I can tell you that this escalation is a loser for them."The U.S. had already imposed new tariffs on China before it rolled out its full trade policy in April. China, along with Canada and Mexico, was hit with new levies at the start of Trump's second term as part of what the administration said was an effort to stop fentanyl from entering the U.S.The trade war has spooked investors around the world by increasing the odds of slower economic growth, higher inflation and lower corporate profits, sparking a sharp sell-off in April. The S&P 500 finished Tuesday down nearly 20% from its peak, putting the U.S. large-cap stock index in a bear market. South Korea's Kospi Index fell into a bear market of its own on Wednesday. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong are also down sharply since the U.S. tariff announcement on April 2.Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

He imposed levies on China as high as 104% along with import taxes on roughly 60 trading partners. China held off on immediate retaliation to the new tariffs after hitting back within minutes in February and March. 

Meanwhile, treasuries extended their declines and European stocks plunged after Trump hiked trade tariffs to a 100-year high. The yield on 30-year Treasuries surged to the highest since November 2023 amid growing doubts about the haven status of US sovereign bonds. Europe's stock benchmark fell more than 3%. Oil sank to a fresh four-year low.

In their current form, rising prices are inevitable."We are therefore convinced that fair competition, open markets, and partnership relations with the United States are in the interest of both sides and continue to rely on the U.S. government to strive to maintain a strong and growing economy and an attractive climate for businesses." contacted the media section of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office for comment via email outside of normal business hours.The comments underscore what many economists have warned about tariffs—that they will drive up inflation because they function as a tax on American consumers.Higher costs for businesses and consumers threaten to trigger a recession in the U.S., and such fears are driving sharp losses in the stock markets.Advocates of tariffs say these costs are worth it to rebuild America's manufacturing sector, create high-paying jobs, and keep supply chains secure from a national security point of view.The best way to avoid the tariffs, Trump has told businesses, is to make goods inside the U.S.EU officials had suggested sector-specific zero-for-zero tariffs with the U.S., such as in industrial goods and autos, but Trump rejected the idea.Asked if this was "enough" by a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday evening, Trump replied: "No, it's not.""The EU has been very tough over the years, I always say it was formed really to do damage to the United States in trade, that's the reason it was formed," Trump said.The president said the EU is taking advantage of the U.S. through its reliance on American defense spending via NATO and because of the trade deficit.He wants the European bloc to open its market more to American companies. He sees the current trading relationship as strongly imbalanced in the EU's favor."We're paying them to guard them militarily and they're screwing us on trade, so that's not a good combination," Trump said.Senior European officials are urging their companies not to invest in the U.S. as a consequence of the tariffs, calling for a unified response.Trump: I'm Defending U.S. From Trade CheatersOn Tuesday evening, as his tariffs were about to take effect, against a backdrop of sharp stock market losses and rising borrowing costs for the U.S. government, Trump accused America's trading partners of having "cheated.""I'm proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers," Trump said in a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in Washington D.C."The president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.

The first delivery is scheduled for 2026, followed by ongoing deliveries to the Swedish Armed Forces. FMV has emphasized the importance of short lead times in this procurement in order to deliver operational capability to the armed forces in a limited timeframe. The radar systems are expected to enhance both air and maritime situational awareness and provide increased operational mobility due to their inherently mobile configuration. According to FMV project manager Per Schylström, the ability to rapidly reinforce radar coverage in prioritized areas is a key operational benefit of the new system.The GM200 MM/C acquisition is linked to a pre-existing Letter of Intent between Sweden and the Netherlands. This framework includes provisions for information exchange, harmonization of technical requirements and contractual terms for future procurements, the alignment of maintenance agreements and system development, and coordination of industrial cooperation. FMV considers supply security a central factor in this procurement, aiming to distribute delivery risks and meet the need for high production capacity.Sweden becomes the fifth NATO country to select the GM200 MM/C radar. The system, produced by Thales Nederland, was introduced in 2024 and was developed in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Army. The radar is part of the Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission (GM200 MM) family and shares technology with land-based GM200 and naval NS100/200 systems. The GM200 MM/C is optimized for Counter Battery and Weapon Locating operations and supports missions ranging from Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) to Medium Range Air Defence (MRAD). It is deployable in less than two minutes and is transportable by road, rail, or tactical aircraft.The radar uses 4D Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology, which features dual-axis multi-beam capabilities allowing unrestricted beam steering in both azimuth and elevation. It operates in the S-band frequency and incorporates full Doppler waveforms, Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM) capabilities, and Gallium Nitride (GaN) transmitters. It also integrates cyber protection and is interoperable with NATO secret networks. The GM200 MM/C provides an instrumented range of over 400 kilometers, elevation coverage up to 80°, and ceiling coverage up to 100,000 feet. It is designed for 24/7 availability in environments without GPS or in the presence of electronic warfare interference.Detection capabilities of the GM200 MM/C include Air Breathing Targets (ABTs), hovering helicopters, cruise missiles, sea surface targets, rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), and unmanned aerial vehicles ranging from Class I (Mini) to Class IV (High Altitude Long Endurance). The radar offers automatic detection, tracking, and classification of targets, including simultaneous support for air surveillance and counter-battery operations. It supports functions such as point of origin and point of impact determination and kill assessment for ground-based air defense missions. The system features software-defined radar architecture, enabling future capability expansion without requiring major upgrades or prolonged service interruptions.The unit price for the GM200 MM/C is approximately €14.5 million, based on the Danish procurement of five radars in 2022 for a total of DKK 540 million. Other confirmed operators of the GM200 MM/C include the Netherlands, which ordered 26 units; Denmark, with five units ordered in 2023; Norway, with eight units ordered across 2021 and 2022; and Lithuania, which selected the radar in 2023 for installation on Mercedes-Benz Zetros 6×6 trucks. Brazil also ordered the GM200 MM/A variant in 2024. The United Kingdom has signaled interest in procuring the GM200 MM/C for the Serpens Project, potentially to be installed on mission modules for the Boxer vehicle.The GM200 MM/C system’s design enables use in both fixed and mobile configurations and supports rapid redeployment, with full mobility and “sense and scoot” functionality achievable in under five minutes. The radar is platform-independent and can be operated either locally or remotely. It features standard interfaces for integration with existing systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China Braces for Trump&apos;s 104% Tariffs | Bloomberg: The China Show 4/9/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvjFyKDtLqM</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yvjFyKDtLqM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 05:18:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Bloomberg: The China Show” is your definitive source for news and analysis on the world's second-biggest economy.

            Despite rattled financial markets, threats of retaliation and some of President Donald Trump’s biggest supporters encouraging him to back off his signature economic policy, he didn’t give in. His administration piled on heaps of new “reciprocal” tariffs Wednesday on dozens of American allies and adversaries alike, aiming to — as he claims — restore fairness and boost American manufacturing.
    
            Goods from China, by far the biggest target, are now subject to at least a 104% tariff. Trump tacked on even higher tariffs than initially announced after Beijing didn’t back off its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs Tuesday.
    
            The reciprocal rates, which aren’t exactly reciprocal, were calculated by dividing a country’s trade deficit with the US by its exports to the country and multiplying by 1/2. They range from 11% to a whopping 50%. Barring Mexico and Canada, America’s other top trading partners were hardly spared in this round. The EU was hit with a 20% reciprocal tariff, China at 34%, Japan at 24%, Vietnam at 46% and South Korea at 25%.
    
            These new rates come just days after Trump imposed a 10% universal tariff on all countries’ imports, aside from Mexico and Canada. (The 10% rate is not additive for countries on the reciprocal tariff list. For instance, Japan’s tariff rate increased by 14% on Wednesday given the 10% was already levied over the weekend.)
    
            “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years. But it is not going to happen anymore,” Trump said last week when announcing the tariffs, the highest the nation has seen in over a century.
    
            Hours before the tariff went into effect Tuesday, Trump made similar comments, adding that other countries, especially China, have “left us for dead, frankly.”
    
            Now, Americans and people across the world are set to pay a steep price. Importers, not the countries Trump targeted, will pay the tariffs, and those costs often get passed on to wholesalers, retailers and ultimately consumers. But businesses abroad won’t be off the hook either, with Americans likely to source goods from countries with lower tariff rates.
    
            Ultimately, Trump’s tariffs threaten to escalate a global trade war. On Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry promised to take “resolute and effective measures” to safeguard its rights and interests, even as it held back from announcing any immediate retaliatory measures.
    
            With several trillion dollars in the market value of US stocks wiped away in the days since April 2 “Liberation Day,” forecasts of an outright global recession have grown.
    
            JPMorgan has raised the chances of a global recession to 60% by the year’s end, from 40%, if Trump carries out the full plan he laid out last week.
    
            “The tariff hikes since the start of the Trump administration now amount to the largest US tax hike in nearly 60 years,” the bank’s economists said in a note last week. “This would have direct ramifications on household and business spending and ripple effects through retaliation, a slide in business sentiment, and supply chain disruptions.”
    
            American consumers will pay at least $2,100 more a year on average because of Trump’s tariffs, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation says.
    
            Since returning to the White House, Trump has been busy. Even before last week, he had previously announced a 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and 25% tariffs across all steel, aluminum and car imports.
    
            Meanwhile, earlier in the week, Goldman Sachs upped its forecast for a US recession in the next 12 months to 45%, a 10-percentage-point increase from prior predictions. In a note titled “Countdown to a Recession,” the bank’s economists said they “had expected the White House to announce a more aggressive tariff at first and then scale it back somewhat.”
    
            Unless all of the enacted tariffs are significantly revised, Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College, predicts the US economy will enter a recession by the second quarter of this year. Even more concerning, tariffs could ignite stagflation, a scenario when economic growth declines significantly and inflation heats up.
    
            “The probability of stagflation is 100%,” he told CNN, adding that inflation from Trump’s tariffs will hit consumer price levels by May and accelerate further in June and July.
    
            Not everyone is predicting a recession, though. Morgan Stanley analysts on Tuesday said the US would avoid recession – because they believed Trump would ultimately strike deals with countries to lower tariffs. And Trump’s chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told Fox News Monday evening that he guaranteed the US economy would not plunge into a recession.
    
            Despite dozens of countries offering to negotiate, it’s not clear that deals can be worked out quickly — if at all. Trump and members of his administration have said that what they consider non-tariff trade barriers — which include currency manipulation, tax policies viewed as unfair and the use of sweatshop labor — are more important than tariffs. That’s why they’ve rejected various nations’ offers to set their tariffs to 0% on US goods in exchange for the same treatment.
    
            Trump’s tariffs have hit the world’s second-largest economy, China, the hardest. Now Beijing is going head-to-head with its larger rival, the US, in a full-blown trade war.
    
            When Trump’s first term ended, the US charged an average tariff rate of 19.3% on Chinese goods, according to a Peterson Institute for International Economics analysis.The Biden administration kept most of Trump’s tariffs in place while also adding others, bringing the average rate to 20.8%.
    
            Both China and the US have benefited from decades of trade. But since Trump’s first term, the US has looked to other countries for goods it had previously imported from China.
    
            Mexico has been a top beneficiary, having overtaken China to become America’s top source of imports in 2023, a position that it maintained last year. Several Asian countries, including Vietnam, South Korea and Taiwan, have also seen trade flows to the US surge since Trump’s first term.
    
            That’s not to say the 104% tariff on Chinese goods won’t matter — it very much will — and they could easily go even higher. Even with pre-existing tariffs in place, China was still the second-biggest source of foreign goods last year, according to US Commerce Department data.
    
            China shipped a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024, while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The country also remained the top foreign source of several items.
    
            The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs.
    
            If Trump were to cancel his tariffs, which he’s repeatedly vowed not to do, much of the economic damage could be undone “but certainly not all,” Colin Grabow, associate director at the Cato Institute’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, told CNN.
    
            “Trump’s actions have significantly hurt US credibility, not only through the tariff’s flimsy justifications but also the violation of long-standing free trade agreements with US trading partners,” he said. “Businesses need a certain degree of certainty in which to operate, and Trump’s chaotic approach is not providing that.”

Sitting next to Israel's Prime Minister, Donald Trump said the US was holding direct talks with Iran. The aim: a deal over Tehran's nuclear program. Trump unilaterally pulled out of the last Iran nuclear deal in 2018, during his first presidency. The White House has confirmed that negotiations are set to continue on Saturday in Oman and will be led by the man seemingly tasked with solving all the world's crises - special envoy Steve Witkoff. 

The great danger that Donald Trump is alluding to there is potential military action. He's threatened to bomb Iran if it fails to agree to a nuclear deal. Iranian officials today were sceptical about Saturday's talks, but they have agreed to take part. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said they would be indirect, likely with Omani mediators shuttling between the parties. He said Tehran wants to see concrete gestures from the US before any officials talk face-to-face.

He told a fundraising gala for House Republicans at the National Building Museum that the US was earning "$2 billion a day" and cast his sweeping levies as "legendary," despite them prompting a large market selloff and spurring predictions about a looming recession.

Many in Mexico viewed the designation as moving the United States toward its first military strike on neighboring Mexico in more than a century.Sheinbaum has agreed to stepped-up military and Central Intelligence Agency surveillance flights over Mexico in a bid to gather intelligence on cartel operations, officials have said.But military strikes would probably cross a red line and could trigger a sharp deterioration in U.S.-Mexico relations — and, experts say, could result in curtailed cooperation in battling illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and resolving other cross-border issues.“Unilateral U.S. strikes on Mexican soil would be devastating for the bilateral relations and could be detrimental to the objective of fighting drug cartels,” Gustavo A. Flores-Macías, professor of government at Cornell University, wrote via email.“The Mexican government would face tremendous domestic pressure to respond in the strongest possible terms — including severing diplomatic relations with the U.S. and collapsing binational cooperation on migration and security, among other topics,” wrote Flores-Macías.The issue of U.S. interference is an extremely sensitive one in a country that lost more than half of its national territory — including present-day California — in the 1846-48 Mexican-American War, a conflict widely viewed here as an act of U.S. imperial aggression. Mexico also endured 20th century incursions, including the 1914 U.S. military occupation of the port of Veracruz and the unsuccessful 1916-17 expedition to capture Gen. Francisco “Pancho” Villa, the Mexican revolutionary leader. Although drone strikes would undoubtedly produce the kind of kinetic optics that President Trump favors, experts have questioned their use against Mexican cartels — highly atomized operations that often produce clandestine drugs in primitive laboratories that can be easily replaced. Sheinbaum has won widespread praise at home and abroad for her administration’s “cool-headed” talks with the Trump administration on the contentious issue of tariffs. The White House has imposed duties on imports of automobiles, steel and aluminum from Mexico, but has largely maintained the free-trade regimen of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, signed in 2020, during Trump’s first White House term.But Trump has also charged that Mexico is “essentially run by the cartels” — an assertion rejected by Sheinbaum, who has said that Mexico would defend its sovereignty against “violations by land, sea or air.”Under the leadership of Sheinbaum, who took office in October, Mexico has stepped up actions against organized crime, arresting scores of alleged traffickers, making record busts of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and shipping 29 purported cartel capos to the United States to face trial. She has quietly dropped the “hugs not bullets” approach of her predecessor and mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who reduced U.S.-Mexico coordination on anti-drug efforts and was widely criticized for not taking a more aggressive stance toward cartels that dominate wide swaths of Mexican territory.Trump has praised Sheinbaum’s actions, calling her a “marvelous woman.” But the U.S. president has still insisted that the United States should “wage war” against drug cartels.Special correspondent Cecilia Sánchez Vidal contributed to this report. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reciprocal Tariffs Go In Effect At Midnight | Balance of Power: Late Edition</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qjrqU0Vun4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9qjrqU0Vun4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 23:28:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Balance of Power: Late Edition" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business.

Polling conducted by Savanta on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, found that six in 10 (59 per cent) adults would support a campaign to buy more British-made goods following sweeping tariffs imposed by the US president. Those of pension age were the most likely to support a ‘Buy British’ campaign with a staggering 81 per cent of those over the age of 65 saying they backed such a movement. Just 13 per cent of the public said they would oppose a campaign of this nature.It comes after the ‘Buy Canadian’ movement in Canada sparked a surge in people buying locally produced goods, with prime minister Mark Carney urging people to do so wherever they can. But speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Ms Reeves said that “ratcheting up barriers to trade, ratcheting up tariffs will not be in our country’s interests, whether that’s in inflation or indeed for supply chains”.She added: “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions.“What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking, because if every country in the world decided that they only wanted to buy things produced in their country, that is not a good way forward.”Asked if the prime minister would echo his chancellor’s sentiment, Sir Keir’s official spokesman said: “Of course. We’re an open-trading nation.“That is something the prime minister and the chancellor have previously said, and we want to see fewer trade barriers around the world, such that we’re continuing to support our economy.“At the same time, we also continue to prioritise and support British manufacturers, British producers.“We have a significant programme of support, whether it’s farmers, whether it’s manufacturers, as yesterday with supporting the car industry. So, we can take a two-pronged approach.“We can be an open-trading nation whilst also supporting British producers and manufacturers.”Pressed on whether the PM can sympathise with public support for a ‘Buy British’ campaign, the official said: “No. That goes against our agenda as an open trading nation. Business have been very clear they don’t want to see a knee-jerk reaction, that includes retaliation. “We’ll keep all options on the table but we want to see lower trade barriers, not higher trade barriers.”The Liberal Democrats have piled pressure on the government to launch a campaign urging people to shop local and back British-made goods, with Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper urging the PM to “listen to the public” and launch a “national effort to back British businesses”. Ms Cooper added: “This would send a collective message to the White House that we are not prepared to simply cower in the corner while Donald Trump takes a wrecking ball to people’s jobs and living standards.“That needs to be combined with a clear plan to unleash the potential of our businesses and high streets, including scrapping the disastrous jobs tax and reforming the broken business rates.”The trade taxes Mr Trump imposed on goods from most countries resulted in the value of US stocks dropping sharply when markets opened on Monday, following falls in London and across Europe and Asia earlier.The UK government is currently attempting to negotiate a deal which would exempt British industry from the sweeping tariffs, with Downing Street saying the talks are at an “advanced stage”.But asked by reporters in the White House if he was open to pausing tariffs to allow for negotiations, the US leader said: “We’re not looking at that.”Mr Trump also suggested that the levies could be both a negotiating tool to extract concessions out of other countries, as well as a means to raise cash for US coffers.Savanta interviewed 2,170 UK adults online between April 4 and April 6 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks Hit by Wild Volatility on US-China Threats | Bloomberg: The Close 04/08/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mac_vE-p5As</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Mac_vE-p5As?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 23:02:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg Television brings you the latest news and analysis leading up to the final minutes and seconds before and after the closing bell on Wall Street.

Many said the priority was to launch negotiations and avert an outright trade war."We need to remain calm and respond in a way that de-escalates. The stock markets right now show what will happen if we escalate straightaway. But we will be prepared to take countermeasures if needed to get the Americans at the table," Dutch Trade Minister Reinette Klever told reporters.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a press conference in Brussels that the EU stood ready to negotiate a "zero-for-zero" tariff pact for industrial goods."Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the US and find a mutually acceptable compromise," EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič told a news conference.He also said the EU would start collecting a first tranche of targeted retaliatory duties on US imports from 15 April and a second wave from 15 May, in reaction to the US tariffs on European steel and aluminium.Watch: Ursula von der Leyen says Trump tariffs having 'massive impact' on global economyEU ready to fight back if neededHe also made clear that while preferring to negotiate the removal of the tariffs with the US, the EU was ready to step up its response. This could include the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow it to target US services or to limit US companies' access to public procurement tenders in the EU."We are prepared to use every tool to protect the single market," he said, echoing the views of French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin.But some EU countries, particularly exposed to trade with the United States, urged caution.Tánaiste Simon Harris described the ACI as "very much the nuclear option" and said he believed most EU countries were not ready to go near it, at least for now.Outgoing German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the EU should realise it was in a strong position - if it was united."The stock markets are already collapsing and the damage could become even greater ... America is in a position of weakness," he said in Luxembourg.Mr Habeck added that Trump lieutenant Elon Musk's hope of zero tariffs between Europe and the United States reflected this point.The EU is likely to approve this week an initial set of countermeasures on up to $28 billion (€25.5) of US imports ranging from dental floss to diamonds, in response to Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs rather than the broader reciprocal levies.But even that move has proven fraught, with Mr Trump threatening a 200% counter-tariff on EU alcoholic drinks if the bloc goes ahead with an earmarked 50% duty on US bourbon. France and Italy, major exporters of wine and spirits, have expressed concern.The 27-nation bloc is expected to produce a larger package of countermeasures by the end of April, as a response to US car and "reciprocal" tariffs.However, in a war of tariffs on goods, Brussels has less to target than Washington, given US goods imports into the EU totalled €334bn ($366.2bn) in 2024, against €532bn of EU exports.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ralph Macchio is now a Black belt in karate</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pa-A3LmoAo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2Pa-A3LmoAo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 20:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ralph Macchio finally holds a black belt in karate.

The index is now 18.9 per cent below its most recent high on Feb. 19, close to the 20 per cent decline that defines a bear market.S&P 500 companies have lost $5.8 trillion US in stock market value since Trump's tariff announcement last Wednesday, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark was created in the 1950s, according to LSEG data.Global markets had previously posted gains on hopes that Trump might be willing to negotiate down the array of country- and product-specific trade barriers he is erecting around the world's largest consumer market.Japan's Nikkei saw a broad sell-off on Wednesday morning and other Asian markets were braced for falls, hours before the tariffs were set to take effect.The administration has scheduled talks with South Korea and Japan, two close allies and major trading partners, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to visit next week."These are tailored, highly tailored deals," Trump said at a White House event, where he signed executive orders aimed at boosting coal production. "We've had talks with many, many countries, over 70, they all want to come in. Our problem is, can't see that many that fast."But the White House made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 per cent would nevertheless take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET, as planned.WATCH | How China is fighting Trump's tariffs: Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 per cent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week. China has refused to bow to what it called "blackmail" and has vowed to "fight to the end."Administration officials said they would not prioritize negotiations with the world's No. 2 economic power.The U.S. will itself face new tariffs at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday — from Canada — of 25 per cent, on fully-assembled vehicles that aren't compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), when imported into Canada from the U.S. Fully assembled vehicles that are CUSMA-compliant will also be hit with 25 per cent tariffs on their non-Canadian and non-Mexican content, when brought into Canada from the U.S.Prime Minister Mark Carney had telegraphed that Canada would bring these countermeasures forward, and Canada's finance minister confirmed Tuesday that these were moving ahead."Canada continues to respond forcefully to all unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian products," Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.'Not doing exemptions … in the near term'Trump's sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades."Right now, we've received the instruction to prioritize our allies and our trading partners like Japan and Korea and others," White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Fox News.Trump's tailor-made approach to negotiations with individual countries could take into account foreign and military aid as well as economic factors, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.Trump's lead trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Congress that his office is trying to work quickly but is not facing a particular deadline."The president has been clear, again, that he's not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term," Greer told lawmakers.At an evening speech to Republican lawmakers, Trump said he would soon announce "major" tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, arguing the duties would push drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S.Trump's sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades.China is bracing for a war of attrition, and manufacturers are warning about profits and scrambling to plan new overseas plants. Citing rising external risks, Citi cut its 2025 China GDP growth forecast to 4.2 per cent from 4.7 per cent.Three out of four Americans expect prices to rise as Trump's tariffs kick in, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Chipmaker Micron told customers it will impose a tariff-related surcharge starting on Wednesday, while U.S. clothing retailers said they are delaying orders and holding off on hiring. Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for $155 US will cost $220 US when Trump's 46 per cent tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group.Consumers are stocking up while they can. "I'm buying double of whatever — beans, canned goods, flour, you name it," Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart.Broad-based price hikes may not show up immediately, as tariffs will not apply to goods that were already in transit before they took effect.The market slide has prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course. Global oil prices steadied after falling to four-year lows.The European Commission, meanwhile, is considering countertariffs of 25 per cent on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list. Officials said they stood ready to negotiate.The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20 per cent tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks.European pharma companies, also fearful of the tariff fallout, warned the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a meeting that Trump's tariffs would expedite the industry's shift away from Europe and toward the United States.WATCH | Global markets rebound temporarily:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Trump to sign executive orders to boost US coal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGdVvLV2w2U</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KGdVvLV2w2U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 19:54:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump will sign executive orders to boost the coal industry.

The move marks an escalation of the Canada-U.S. trade war in the middle of a federal election campaign, and could increase the price of U.S.-made autos by as much as 25 per cent.The countertariffs are the first imposed by Mark Carney since he became Prime Minister, and the first enacted during Canada’s 45th general election campaign, which ends with voting on April 28. Responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and his repeated talk of making Canada the 51st state has been central to Mr. Carney’s strategy in the campaign, in which his Liberals are polling ahead of their Conservative competition.Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced the retaliatory auto tariffs would apply as of 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The federal government had promised this response after Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles, including from Canada, but had not yet followed through until Tuesday’s abrupt announcement.“Canada continues to respond forcefully to all unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian products,” Mr. Champagne said in a statement. “The government is firmly committed to getting these U.S. tariffs removed as soon as possible, and will protect Canada’s workers, businesses, economy and industry.”Canada had already imposed countertariffs on about $60-billion worth of U.S. imports in response to levies enacted by Mr. Trump earlier this year on a broad range of goods, including Canadian steel and aluminum.A trade dispute involving the North American auto sector will not only cost consumers more, but also threatens to damage the structure of an industry that relies on an integrated supply chain across the United States, Canada and Mexico.Up to 60 per cent of cars purchased in Canada each year are imported from the United States, according to Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. He said Canada is the among the largest export markets for American-made cars, and estimated about 1.2 million vehicles are imported from the United States every year.The tariffs will be 25 per cent on the portion of each vehicle imported from the U.S. that did not originate in Canada or Mexico, in cases where the manufacturing complies with the rules of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA). It will also be 25 per cent on each fully assembled vehicle imported from the U.S. where the automobile’s manufacturing does not comply with USMCA rules.These countermeasures will remain in place until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against the Canadian auto sector, the federal Finance Department said in a statement.The government said duties collected will be used to benefit the Canadian auto sector. Vehicle imports from the U.S. totalled $35.6-billion in 2024, Finance said. Last week, Mr. Carney estimated these retaliatory tariffs would collect $8-billion on an annual basis.Mr. Volpe said Canadians could end up paying 15 per cent to 25 per cent more for a vehicle imported from the United States depending on what portion of the automobile is not Canadian or Mexican content.On April 3, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of 25 per cent on Canadian automobiles and light trucks and vowed another 25-per-cent tariff on some Canadian auto parts starting May 3. The tariffs on Canadian-made autos will be reduced based on their U.S.-made content. Most of the vehicles assembled at Ontario’s plants have about 50-per-cent U.S. content.Mr. Volpe said he believes Canada’s retaliation is justified, even though it will increase prices for cars in Canada. “It will hurt,” he said, but he added that the U.S. will feel the pressure too. “It’s important not to leave these things unanswered,” he said of U.S. protectionism.He noted that Ottawa’s retaliation, at least for now, does not include counter-tariffs on U.S. auto parts.The caretaker convention guides the federal government after Parliament has been dissolved and an election called. This means government is supposed to limit itself to routine matters or urgent events but generally not take steps that bind a future government.Brian Clow, who served as deputy chief of staff to then-prime minister Justin Trudeau, defended Mr. Carney’s decision to impose tariffs during an election campaign.The Prime Minister was responding to new U.S. tariffs imposed on Canada during the campaign, he noted.“It’s well-established that the Prime Minister and cabinet can act during a crisis, and I would say that this is a clear crisis,” Mr. Clow said.Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, was in Washington on Monday and Tuesday, lobbying for an end to all the tariffs imposed on Canadian cars and trucks, steel and aluminum – and for the scrapping of the American plan, set to go into effect May 3, to impose 25-per-cent tariffs on non-U.S. auto parts.In an interview, Mr. Fedeli said he met with automotive industry representatives from both sides of the border and two Republican members of Congress – New York’s Claudia Tenney and Indiana’s Rudy Yakym. He also met with officials in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.He says that in addition to making the case against all of the President’s tariffs on Canada, he is also focusing in the short term on convincing the U.S. to leave Canadian auto parts untouched by additional levies.Mr. Fedeli says his message to U.S. officials is that this will be far too complicated and too damaging to the auto industry’s integrated supply chains that see some car parts cross the border multiple times.“Nobody can figure out how to do that. It’s so complicated that what we’ve said to them is ‘Look, leave the parts the way they are.’ This is really our message,” Mr. Fedeli said. “You really can’t delve into trying to unscramble that omelette.”He said so far, the U.S. officials he has met with seem receptive and understand Ontario’s point of view.Echoing Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s comments last week, Mr. Fedeli said he supported Mr. Carney’s move to impose retaliatory 25-per-cent tariffs on the non-Canadian portion of U.S.-made cars and trucks.“The people of Canada expect that. We did that last time, in Trump 1.0, we put reciprocal tariffs, we fought back,” Mr. Fedeli said. “And I think they’re a step in the right direction, of course.”A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association. It is the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association.

The loss of market capitalization worldwide has reached $10 trillion (€9.2 trillion), according to Bloomberg. That is a figure equivalent to just over half of the GDP of the European Union. For part of Monday’s session, the S&P 500 index, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, accumulated three consecutive drops of 4% for the first time since the Great Depression. The session-by-session collapse was also the largest since the Black Monday crisis of 1987, surpassing the losses recorded during the outbreak of the Covid pandemic (13% in three sessions), the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (13.9%), or the losses of 1998 (11.7%). In 1987, the U.S. stock market plummeted 26% over the course of three days.While stocks have felt the impact globally, value destruction operates on a different scale in the United States. The so-called Magnificent Seven (Apple, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Tesla) are the global companies that have lost the most stock market value, totaling €1.5 trillion since Thursday. The leaders of five of these businesses attended Trump’s inauguration: the top executives of Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Google (Sundar Pichai), Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Apple (Tim Cook), and, of course, Tesla (Elon Musk). These five companies have incurred losses of €1.26 trillion in three days due to Trump’s tariff policy.Apple leads the list, with losses of more than half a trillion dollars. Nvidia comes next with $385 billion, followed by Amazon, with $262 billion, ahead of the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Tesla has lost the least value, but that is because it is the least valuable of the group. Apple’s value drop has been very large in percentage terms (16.8%) and in absolute value, as it is directly impacted by the tariffs; analysts expect sharp price increases for its devices, which are manufactured entirely in Asia. In contrast, Meta and Google, which are both software-focused companies, have lost less than half that amount in relative terms. “This sudden volatility comes after a long period of calm in the stock market,” according to the wealth management group Mirabaud, “which makes the recent sell-off even more striking.” According to this asset manager, private investors have abandoned technology, and hedge funds have followed suit.Coming behind the Magnificent Seven in terms of stock market losses is the leading non-U.S. stock, the Saudi state oil company Aramco, which lost €126 billion, albeit only 8% in value. Then come the giants of the traditional U.S. economy: JP Morgan, Eli Lilly, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Bank of America... Icons of the great America championed by Trump, who have nevertheless suffered firsthand from the president’s attempts to reverse globalization and have hemorrhaged more than €50 billion in three days. UBS analysts have remarked that the spike in volatility is fundamental and could be long-lasting: “This won’t suddenly fade away unless we start to see signs that the U.S. might not enter a recession or tariffs begin to ease.”European companies are typically smaller than American ones, which is why their market capitalization losses have also been more modest. So far, the European stocks that have lost the most market capitalization are British companies: HSBC and Shell, followed by Siemens (Germany), LVMH (France), Total (France), and SAP (Germany). Companies from Denmark (Novo Nordisk), Ireland (Accenture), and the Netherlands (ASML) are also on the list of the biggest losers. Other companies include some from China (Alibaba), Japan (Toyota and Mitsubishi), Taiwan (TSMC), which lost €78 billion in value in just one session (last week was partly a holiday in the country), and Samsung, with €35 billion in three days.Without trade negotiations or concessions on the horizon, the market seems headed for more jitters and instability, a scenario with an end-of-an-era feel that is being echoed in investment banking reports. “Investors must now confront the possibility that Pax Americana (American peace, in Latin), an era of relative stability and global order under the influence of the United States after World War II, is coming to an end,” reported Muzinich & Co., an investment firm whose CEO was Undersecretary of the Treasury in Trump’s first term.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Set to Hit China With Sweeping 104% Tariffs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAd8yLEzxc</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/veAd8yLEzxc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 18:20:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The White House says President Donald Trump will impose sweeping 104% tariffs on many Chinese goods on April 9 at 12:01 am ET.

Most iPhones, Apple’s best-selling and most important product, are manufactured in China, which is in line for tariffs of 54%.

- Robinhood (HOOD) is on the move this morning after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight to overweight. In a tougher macro backdrop with greater need to hedge risks, the firm sees risks for retail dis-engagement to pressure trading revenue at Robinhood, leading it to cut EPS estimates.

- Tesla (TSLA) shares have climbed along with the market today. It comes as Joel Levington, Director of Credit Research for Bloomberg Intelligence, writes this morning that Elon Musk's pursuit of ambitious and high-risk bets such as the Cybertruck -- are now falling well short of sales goals even with aggressive lease discounts - and the elusive RoboTaxi are taking a toll on Tesla's fundamental performance at a critical juncture in the auto market.

- Walgreens (WBA) is rising after it reported quarterly profit that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, marking a strong performance in what is likely one of its last quarters as a public company. It's welcome news for investors of the second-largest US pharmacy chain, who have been concerned about the ability of Walgreens to make enough money amid declining insurance payments for prescription drugs, and increased competition from online retailers and big box stores.

They’re bombing — I don’t know what’s happening there. That’s not a good situation,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The president made these remarks in response to a question about why his new tariff plan excluded Russia. Trump explained that the US is “not doing business, essentially, with Russia, because they’re at war.”Trump claimed that American officials are engaged in discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, suggesting they are “getting sort of close” to an agreement, though he did not specify whether this meant a ceasefire was imminent.The White House had previously attributed the absence of new tariffs on Russia to ongoing US negotiations with Moscow aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.Trump’s dissatisfaction with Russia’s ongoing bombardment of Ukraine follows a deadly Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih that killed at least 19 people, including nine children, on 4 April. Reports indicate this was one of the deadliest attacks in the war this year.Trump also told officials earlier this month that he was “pissed off” during a recent call with the Russian leader, who rejected Trump’s proposal for an immediate and complete ceasefire in Ukraine.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has acknowledged that Russian forces are violating the truce in Ukraine and warned that “Trump will not fall into the trap of endless negotiations.”You could close this page.

The EU plans to charge import duties of up to 25 per cent on a number of products sold from the US, in the bloc’s initial response to massive tariffs on global trade introduced by US president Donald Trump.The European Commission is now planning a further package of tariffs, beyond the measures EU states are due to vote to approve on Wednesday. It would take a qualified majority of EU leaders voting against to rescind the proposed levies. The European commission is the EU’s executive arm that formulates the bloc’s trade policy, The list of US products and goods that are to be hit with tariffs by the EU has been the subject of intense lobbying between national capitals over recent weeks. Bourbon, wine and US dairy products had been in the firing line, but France, Italy and Ireland lobbied hard against their inclusion, over fears their domestic spirits and agricultural industries would in turn be drawn into the middle of the EU-US dispute. Mr Trump had warned that if the EU taxed bourbon, he would respond by putting 200 per cent tariffs on Irish whiskey, French champagne, Italian wine and other European spirits. The Government had also been concerned about Ireland’s large exports of butter to the US, if Mr Trump was angered by tariffs put on US cheese. The final list of products the EU plans to raise tariffs on includes soybeans, almonds, an extensive range of steel and clothing products, as well as motor-powered boats. The EU will also target US exports of oranges, poultry, sausages, raspberries, kitchenware, door and window frames, and non-alcoholic beer. The tariffs, which are effectively taxes to import goods, will range from between 10 and 25 per cent. The EU had been drawing up this initial package of counter-tariffs since Mr Trump announced tariffs of 25 per cent on imports of steel and aluminium from the EU and elsewhere in mid-March. Those were followed by similar US tariffs on imports of automobiles and car parts. Why did Irish pharma exports escape the tariff guillotine?Then came Mr Trump’s sweeping levies on nearly all trading partners last week, which saw the president hit EU states with blanket 20 per cent tariffs on imports to the US. The European Commission had drawn up the range of US products to hike trade levies on. EU states will now vote to approve the retaliatory measures on Wednesday. The tariffs will impact about €21 billion worth of US trade with the EU. Initially some €26 billion worth of trade had been in the commission’s crosshairs. However, it reconsidered import duties on bourbon and other products, on foot of lobbying from capitals. Barry Cowen, a Fianna Fáil MEP, said the decision to not tariff US bourbon and dairy was welcome. The final list of US products set to be subject to tariffs would be “less economically disruptive” to EU states, while still putting pressure on the US to negotiate. The series of tariffs announced by Mr Trump will raise the cost of importing €380 billion worth of goods into the US from the EU. Government delays Spring economic statement amid tariff uncertaintyCommission officials are examining a number of options, which include targeting the trade of services – such as the output of US tech and social media giants – as well as goods. The Government is opposed to dragging US tech multinationals into the fray, given the high concentration of the companies with European bases in Dublin. Commission officials continue to stress that the EU wants to cut a deal with the US, to end the cycle of tit-for-tat tariffs Mr Trump has kicked off. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: White House press briefing</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1t2_xZqgUg</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/w1t2_xZqgUg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 15:06:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as President Donald Trump's White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt briefs the media.

The U.S. has one military base on the island called the Pituffik Space Base and began stationing forces here after Denmark was invaded by Germany during WWII. So why did the U.S. exit the territory in the first place and what level of involvement do they have on the island today?

WSJ explains Denmark’s efforts to boost defense here with dog-sleds and drones – and why the U.S. abandoned several military bases there decades ago.

"What do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them."The comments come a day ahead of the U.S. raising its duties on China and dozens of other nations as part of so-called reciprocal tariffs whose purpose, Bessent said, is to bring trading partners to the negotiating table and jobs back to the U.S.So far, he said Japan has been at the forefront of countries eager to negotiate, and the White House expects a multitude of others."I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly," Bessent said. "If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals."Ultimately, the hope would be to generate both jobs and revenue from the tariffs, he added."If we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs," Bessent said. "If we're successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you're taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline."In return, President Donald Trump said he will slap another 50% charge on Chinese imports if the tariff is not withdrawn. The U.S. in 2024 ran a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China, or about one-third of the entire imbalance.With the tariffs, Trump is hoping to open up more markets for American products and reshore manufacturing operations to the U.S. However, the administration is not simply focusing on absolute tariff levels from other nations but rather nontariff barriers such as currency manipulation, Europe's value-added tax and other methods the White House says undermine fair trade."Everything is on the table," Bessent said. "The academic literature shows that it's actually the nontariff barriers which are harder, both harder to quantify and ... they're more insidious because they're hidden, they're obfuscated."Stock market futures, which already had been indicating a strong open on Wall Street, added to gains after Bessent spoke.Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

Trump and his allies have long argued that his tariff policy will boost the US economy and protect jobs.But economists have warned that this would cause major disruptions to international supply chains, push up prices for consumers and bode disaster for all trade.In the wake of the tariffs announcement, financial institutions have warned of heightened risks of a recession, both in the US and globally.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Indigenous Brazilians protest in capital over land</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcGhxlQQHcI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LcGhxlQQHcI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 12:54:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of Indigenous peoples gather in Brazil's capital Brasília to defend their land.

This would have allowed them to watch it unfold in real time.The findings are consistent with revelations by The Telegraph that found Russia carried out online research of fire protocols at a Berlin factory owned by a defence firm just before a suspected sabotage attack.The Telegraph also disclosed in March that German authorities suspected a string of terror attacks committed by foreigners, in the run-up to the February 2025 German elections, may have been orchestrated by Russia.During that period, five deadly attacks were carried out in the cities of Solingen, Mannheim, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich by foreign citizens, most of them failed asylum seekers.The ZDF investigation was supported by Steven Broschart, a forensic data analyst who helps German law enforcement agencies.“We actually find search queries from Russia about the perpetrator in advance, including the perpetrator’s name, and that is very, very unusual,” Mr Broschart told ZDF.There is no proof that the Mannheim attack was arranged by Russia, ZDF reported, but German politicians have said the findings were still significant.Konstantin von Notz, the chairman of the intelligence committee of the Bundestag, the German parliament, told ZDF: “I think it is quite obvious that these digital traces, and their examination and evaluation, are important building blocks in getting to the truth of what happened and in that respect they should be taken into account.”Earlier in 2025, The Telegraph revealed that suspected Russian agents carried out internet research of fire safety protocols at a factory in Berlin owned by Diehl, a German arms firm, before it burst into flames.European security sources said the research, such as the type of fire engines on standby near the factory, was carried out several weeks before and after the blaze.The sources said Russia may have deliberately left traces of that research to send a clear signal to the West that it was targeting German arms firms which support Ukraine as part of its hybrid warfare campaign.The Telegraph also revealed in March that German authorities are exploring the theory that some of the terror attacks committed by foreigners in the 10 months before Germany’s last election may have had Russian involvement.The theory suggests that Russia attempted to recruit mentally ill asylum seekers and other extremists to commit the attacks, in an attempt to boost the popularity of the pro-Kremlin Alternative for Germany (AfD) before polling day.“Some of these attacks happened when the AfD had a low curve in its popularity,” a German security source said at the time. “We know the Russians are using second-hand agents, little guys on the street, to make it more difficult to understand who is behind it.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

They're bombing — I don't know what's happening there," Trump said.His remarks came a day after similar comments on April 6, when he said, "I don't like the bombing."The recent escalation includes a deadly missile strike on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky's hometown, on April 4. The attack killed 20 people, including 9 children. On April 6, a Russian ballistic missile strike on Kyiv killed one and injured three others.Ukraine on March 11 agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire, but Russia rejected the deal unless it curtailed foreign military aid and imposed restrictions on Ukraine's armed forces.Trump's renewed criticism follows limited progress in U.S.-mediated talks held in Jeddah on March 11. The sides settled on a partial ceasefire focused on energy infrastructure and the Black Sea.Just two days after the agreement, Ukraine accused Russia of violating the deal by striking power facilities in Kherson. Moscow denied the attack but warned it "reserves the right" to exit the agreement if Ukraine fails to comply. The Kremlin also accused Ukraine of striking the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast, a claim Kyiv dismissed as an attempt to justify further attacks.Despite his role as mediator, Trump has not taken punitive measures in response to Russia's renewed aggression. He reiterated on April 7 that Moscow had avoided U.S. tariffs only because "we're not doing business, essentially, with Russia, because they're at war."Trump's new tariff regime, announced under the "Liberation Day" policy, slapped duties on most major U.S. trading partners — including a 10% tariff on Ukraine. The European Union was hit with 20%, and China with 54%. However, Russia, Belarus, North Korea, and Cuba were not included.NBC News reported on March 30 that Trump is "pissed off" at Russian President Vladimir Putin's personal animosity toward Zelensky, while the Telegraph wrote on March 23 that he is increasingly angry over Russia's refusal to de-escalate the war.Although Trump has repeatedly voiced disapproval over the violence, he has yet to introduce sanctions or direct measures to pressure the Kremlin, which continues its offensive operations across Ukraine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Senate hearing on Trump&apos;s trade policy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2jRu2XVETc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/f2jRu2XVETc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 12:23:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies before the Senate Finance Committee on President Donald Trump’s trade policy.

Harry, King Charles' younger son, is trying to overturn a decision by the Home Office - the ministry responsible for policing - which decided in February 2020 he would not automatically receive personal police security while in Britain.
 
Last year, the High Court in London ruled that decision was lawful and refused him permission to challenge that ruling in a higher court. However, the Court of Appeal agreed to hear the case following a direct application from Harry's lawyers.

China refused to bow to what it called "blackmail" from the United States as a global trade war ignited by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs showed few signs of abating on Tuesday, even as battered stock markets steadied.

2. Prince Harry made a rare public appearance in Britain on Tuesday at London's Royal Courts of Justice to fight the government over changes made to his security after he stepped down from royal duties, which his lawyer branded unfair and unjustified.

3. World markets won a reprieve on Tuesday after three days of heavy selling that wiped trillions of dollars off the value of shares, but the mood was cautious with a focus on whether Washington might negotiate on some of its aggressive tariffs.

4. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed Donald Trump to pursue deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members using a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration, but with certain limits.

5. Leading contenders began to throw their hats in the ring on Tuesday as South Korea officially set June 3 for a snap presidential election triggered by last week's removal from office of impeached leader Yoon Suk Yeol.

            Speaking to Fox News last Thursday, Vance defended President Donald Trump’s market-hammering tariffs and railed against the “globalist economy.”
    
            “What has the globalist economy gotten the United States of America? And the answer is, fundamentally, it’s based on two principles – incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us,” Vance told news show “Fox & Friends.”
    
            “To make it a little more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture.”
    
            Asked about Vance’s comments at a regular news briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: “It’s both astonishing and lamentable to hear this vice president make such ignorant and disrespectful remarks.”
    
            CNN has reached out to Vance’s office for comment.
    
            Clips of Vance’s interview made their way to the Chinese internet this week, drawing an intense backlash in a country where factory floors are lined with industrial robots, cities are embracing homegrown electric vehicles and remote counties are connected by a nationwide web of high-speed railways.
    
            “This true ‘peasant’ who came out of rural America seems to have a lack of perspective,” said Hu Xijin, the influential former editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times, in a post on microblogging site Weibo. “Many people are urging him to come and see China for himself.”
    
            A hashtag on Vance’s remarks became the top trending topic on Weibo on Monday night. By Tuesday afternoon, it had racked up 140 million views.
    
            “Look, this is their true face — arrogant and rude as always,” said a comment with 2,900 likes.
    
            “We may be peasants, but we have the world’s best high-speed rail system, the most powerful logistics capabilities, and leading AI, autonomous driving, and drone technologies. Aren’t such peasants quite impressive?” another said.
    
            Others noted the irony of Vance’s comments given his own working-class upbringing as depicted in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”
    
            In the book, Vance chronicles a childhood plagued by poverty, abuse and his mother’s drug addiction and spent partly in Appalachia, a corner of the United States he felt had been forgotten by wealthy elites. The book by Vance –  a venture capitalist before his foray into politics – caused a sensation after Trump’s first election win and was widely seen as an explanation for the billionaire’s rise among the White working class.

No further clashes were reported, but Seoul said it is maintaining heightened vigilance in response to what it called a "serious provocation."The incident comes amid a spike in tensions on the peninsula, as North Korea continues a series of weapons tests while ignoring diplomatic overtures from U.S. President Donald Trump. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to restart talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang, however, has remained silent, accusing Washington of intensifying hostile policies despite the change in administration.The incident underscores ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where high-level diplomatic efforts have stalled and military posturing has intensified. While similar border violations have occurred in the past—such as one in June 2024 that also prompted warning shots—they rarely result in direct conflict. The current intrusion comes amid heightened political instability in South Korea and continued provocations from the North.South Korea is navigating the fallout from the dramatic ouster of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week. Yoon was removed from office after his controversial decision to impose martial law in the wake of mass protests—a move that was widely condemned at home and abroad. The leadership vacuum in Seoul has further complicated the already fragile security situation on the Korean Peninsula.The Demilitarized Zone stretches 248 kilometers (155 miles) across the peninsula and is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) wide. It remains one of the most fortified borders in the world, layered with barbed wire, land mines, tank traps, and combat units. The DMZ was established as part of the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, which never formally concluded with a peace treaty.Tuesday's incursion follows a pattern of similar low-level violations that have not escalated into major flashpoints. South Korean authorities have previously assessed such movements as accidental, especially in regions with dense vegetation and poor visibility of boundary markers. Last year's incident involved North Korean soldiers carrying construction tools, and officials at the time concluded there was no deliberate attempt to provoke confrontation.The South Korean military did not attribute a motive to the North's movement but reaffirmed its readiness."Our military issued warnings and fired warning shots, and the North Korean soldiers retreated," a South Korean  official told reporters."We are closely observing the North's military status and taking necessary measures to plan our strategy."South Korean political analysts suggested the North may be testing reaction times or unintentionally breaching the boundary due to ongoing construction or terrain challenges. However, no official comment has been released from Pyongyang.North Korean leader Kim has deepened ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and continued to expand his country's nuclear capabilities. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed interest in restarting talks with Kim, though Pyongyang has yet to respond and continues to denounce Washington's policies.Regional observers expect the Korean Peninsula to remain volatile, with both militaries maintaining heightened alert status amid leadership changes and shifting alliances.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Britain&apos;s King Charles and Queen Camilla visit Italy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR1099hW02M</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uR1099hW02M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 09:47:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[King Charles and Queen Camilla began a a four-day state visit to Italy during which the British monarch will address the Italian parliament in Rome.

In Cairo, he met with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah to discuss efforts to revive the ceasefire in Gaza that collapsed last month. In a joint statement, they said Gaza must be ruled by a strengthened Palestinian Authority, once its war with Israel is over. Macron said that militant group Hamas must no longer have any role in governing Gaza or continue to pose a threat to Israel. The three also held a joint phone call with US President Donald Trump.

At the same time, aerospace giant Boeing may find it hard to find foreign buyers for its sixth-generation F-47, the centerpiece of the United States Air Force‘s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) system of systems.Some of America‘s closest allies are already exploring other options. Two competing sixth-generation fighter programs are underway, and now one could expand.Will Australia and Canada Join GCAP?According to a recent report from aviation trade magazine, an official with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has received an “informational briefing [on] the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) consortium—a trilateral initiative between the UK, Italy, and Japan to develop a sixth-generation fighter.”Originally known as the Tempest in the UK, the program aims to field an aircraft by the mid-2030s, replacing Japan‘s F-2 and the Eurofighter Typhoon used by the UK and Italy. The fighter is expected to feature optional manning, an augmented reality cockpit, “Loyal Wingmen” support, and possibly directed-energy weapons and AI co-pilots.Last October, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, the UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey, and Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto met on the sidelines of the Group of Seven defense minister meeting in Naples. It announced that the GCAP International Government Organization (GIGO) would be set up to oversee the development of the next-generation fighter.As reported by , Australia has expressed interest in joining the effort and could be joined by Canada. Following the Trump administration‘s decision last month to impose a 25 percent tariff on Canadian imports and the president‘s repeated calls to make the neighbor to the north the “fifty-first state,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney launched a review into Ottawa‘s deal with Washington to purchase eighty-eight F-35s.Ottawa has reportedly explored alternatives, including the French-made Dassault Rafale and the Swedish Saab JAS 39 Gripen. Meanwhile, Canberra has also been reviewing its options, following Washington‘s 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the land down under.Australia and Canada are members of the Commonwealth of Nations (AKA the British Commonwealth) and have deep ties with the UK. They have “Royal” air forces, the RAAF and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which have operated British-designed/made fighters.Last month, David Chadwick, a British Liberal Democrat MP for Brecon, Radnor, and Cwm Tawe, called for the UK‘s Ministry of Defence (MoD) to invite Canada to join the GCAP program. UK Defence Minister Maria Eagle responded that the consortium members would be open to Canada‘s cooperation on the program if it would not delay or otherwise impede it. also reported it signaled “a potential pathway for Canadian involvement, and analysts have noted that Canada may be a suitable candidate due to its membership in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and strong defense ties with the UK. Additionally, Canada‘s recent procurement of the F-35A aligns its fleet with those of the GCAP nations, all of which operate or plan to operate the same aircraft.”Australia already operates the F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, and is a member of the Australia, United Kingdom, United States (AUKUS) consortium with the UK and the U.S. While it calls for closer ties between the three states, including the development of defense technology, its tier one program, centered on nuclear-powered submarines that all three nations could operate, has been criticized by President Donald Trump in the past.Given these facts, Australia and Canada could likely become junior partners in the GCAP program.  About the Author: Peter Suciu is a Michigan-based writer.

A statement from China’s Ministry of Commerce added that the new US tariff's were groundless and a typical "unilateral bullying practice.” 

Beijing promised countermeasures after some Asian stock markets re-opened with slightly better results following a volatile day of trading on Monday. Japanese, Australian and South Korean shares improved their positions. The Nikkei index opened around two percent better and continued to improve. 

The news comes on top of a week of turmoil started by US President Donald Trump aiming to correct what he calls unfair trade practices.

The Barents Observer counted the number of verdicts issued by military courts in the northern regions of Russia.In Russian criminal law, military refusal to serve is divided into several categories. Unauthorized abandonment of a unit (Article 337 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) is when a serviceman leaves his place of service without permission, but without the clear intention to completely evade service. Desertion (Article 338) is a more serious crime: a conscious and final departure with the intent not to return. Sometimes the investigation starts the case as desertion, but courts often reclassify it as unauthorized absence — especially if the serviceman returns voluntarily.Faking illness (Article 339) is another way of evasion, where a serviceman tries to avoid service by pretending to have health problems. However, cases under this article are not initiated very often.The difference between the articles is primarily in the wording and maximum terms: desertion carries up to 15 years, unauthorised absence up to 10, and faking illness also up to 10 years.Military towns in the Kola PeninsulaThe Murmansk Region is the only region in the north where six garrison military courts operate simultaneously. This is directly related to the region's dense military presence: the Northern Fleet is based here along with strategic submarines, air defence units and coastal troops. Almost every second settlement in the region is a garrison town. Severomorsk, Polyarny, Gadzhievo, Zaozyorsk, Pechenga, Alakurtti, Vidyayevo - all these towns exist around military service. It was here that mobilisation and participation in the war was felt first and foremost, and it was here that there was a sharp increase in criminal cases against those who decided to refuse to fight.The Murmansk Garrison Military Court issued 152 sentences in the course of the two first years of full-scale war, mainly under the article on unauthorised absence from the unit. Only three cases concerned desertion, although prosecutors often try to initiate cases with this more serious article. One of the few sentences of desertion, the text of which was made publicly available, is the case of Yevgeny Safonov, a contract soldier of the Northern Fleet. He twice left the unit without permission. In one of the episodes, he returned, but instead of starting service, he climbed over the fence and left, not answering calls from the command. The court regarded this as failure to report for duty during mobilisation. Initially, he was accused of desertion, but the court mitigated the article and sentenced Safarov to three years in a general prison colony.In the Gadzhiyevo Garrison Court, there have been 46 sentences since February 2022. For comparison: in 2021, there were only two such cases, in 2020 — one, in 2019 — two. An increase of more than twenty times. In Severomorsk, where the headquarters of the Northern Fleet is located, 22 sentences have been issued since the start of the full-scale invasion. Before the war, there were only a few cases per year. In Zaozersk, there are another 113. In 2021, there were eleven cases here, in 2020 — two.In Severomorsk, there is also another legal body — the Northern Fleet Military Court. It hears appeals against decisions of lower courts in the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions. Since October 2022, the court has issued 272 decisions on “military” articles.Barents Observer spoke with one of the Russian 'refuseniks' — the 29-year-old Dmitry Vasilets, a former serviceman of the Northern Fleet. He spent a year and three months in a settlement colony to avoid returning to the war in Ukraine. According to Vasilets, he refused to carry out combat orders on moral grounds after the death of two close friends. In the interview, he said that in his brigade, at least five or six officers followed the same path, preferring to admit guilt and serve real terms — albeit minimal — rather than being sent back to the front.In the Arkhangelsk region, cases of refusal to serve are distributed among three garrison courts — in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk, and Mirny. Each of them reflects its military landscape: from coastal units to missile units and strategic facilities.The Arkhangelsk garrison court recorded 114 sentences under 'military' articles. It is the largest court in the region by the number of cases, considering cases of both contract soldiers and those mobilised from support and communication units.In Severodvinsk — a city where the Sevmash and Zvezdochka yards are located, building nuclear submarines for the Navy and carrying out their repairs — there is a separate garrison court. It has 94 sentences to its credit. Court decisions are not published, but the overall number shows that disciplinary and criminal pressure on those who do not want to serve remains high.In Mirny — a city near the Plesetsk Cosmodrome — the situation clearly illustrates how quickly the workload on the garrison court can change. In 2022, there were no sentences here. In 2021, 2020, and 2019 — one case per year. And since the beginning of 2023 — 59 sentences, almost all under the article on 'absence without leave'.In Komi, there is one military court in operation — the Vorkuta Military Court. After 2023, it started to publish decisions with the names of individuals involved. In total, there are 75 decisions on 'military' articles. One of them is the case of V.V. Napalkov, convicted for two episodes of leaving his unit during the mobilisation period. He initially hid for three weeks, returned, then disappeared again for two months, living with friends and family.The court sentenced Napalkov to 6 years and 6 months of imprisonment. He claimed he had received verbal permission to be absent, but the court did not believe him.The Petrozavodsk Garrison Military Court — the only military court in Karelia — has issued 136 sentences on military articles over two years of war. For comparison, in 2021, there was only one such case, in 2020 — none, and in 2019 — three. That is, over the entire preceding five-year period, there were only four sentences, but after the invasion — an average of five per month.This court publishes decisions with open names, and some materials remain available on the official website.Among these is the sentence of V.R. Nummert, a contract soldier who did not return from leave in the autumn of 2022 and hid with relatives for over a year, working in various jobs. In court, he explained his behaviour as a fear of going to war and a desire to "rest a little." The court did not accept these explanations and sentenced him to six years in a strict regime under Article 338 of the Russian Criminal Code.If we add up all the mentioned decisions by garrison courts in northern Russia, there are more than 800 court decisions under Articles 337, 338, and 339 of the Criminal Code, starting from the spring of 2022. This is a minimum, as many courts do not publish decisions or hide them under general terms. The northern regions, especially those with military bases, are now areas where military personnel flee, hide, and fake illness. And military courts are increasing the flow of sentences.The north is not the only region in Russia where mass refusals to participate in the war are recorded. According to an internal presentation for Russian officials, published by the Ukrainian community InformNapalm and analysed by Frontelligence Insight, the total number of documented cases of refusal to serve, including unauthorised absence, in 2024 amounted to 50,554. Most criminal cases were initiated in the Southern Military District — almost 12,000, of which 58% were mobilised from the so-called "LDNR," report newspaper Important Stories. BBC reported that in Ukraine, since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than 95,000 cases of desertion and unauthorised absence from duty have been opened. This is about 10% of the Ukrainian army. The human rights project “Go to the Forest” helps Russians who refuse to fight.“From the first days of mobilisation, we have been doing everything to help Russians evade conscription, leave the country, find asylum, and much more. Just so that as few people as possible pull the trigger. More than 46 thousand people have already received help,” state the human rights activists. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have fled the war</title><link>https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/tens-of-thousands-of-russian-soldiers-have-fled-the-warnbsp/427843</link><author>/u/Gjrts</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 06:25:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian garrison courts have busy days as the number of Russian soldiers fleeing war is soaring. Back in 2021, such cases were rare, but since 2022 - there have been tens of thousands across the country.

Whether running AI models, spinning up infrastructure, or just trying to keep your SaaS lights on, the cost of relying on US-based hardware and cloud will rise. A lot. In this issue, we explore how the tariffs will reshape Europe’s cloud and AI landscape—and what you should be doing  to protect your margins, roadmap, and resilience.  Read on for the full article. US tariffs are here—and they’ve landed squarely on the backbone of AI and cloud infrastructure.On April 2nd, the US government introduced sweeping tariffs on imports, notably from tech hardware manufacturing hubs in East Asia. In a nutshell, US hardware manufacturers and resellers - even as a service - will pay a lot more to maintain production in the short term.  The fallout? A sudden and potentially severe cost increase for European companies building or running anything in the cloud. At the time of writing, no reciprocal (re-reciprocal?) tariffs have yet been introduced by the EU, but it’s a distinct possibility.  This isn’t just a spreadsheet problem. It’s a strategic one. Let’s break it down. What’s Getting More Expensive?Data centre gear—servers, networking equipment, racks, switches, the whole lot—is about to get pricier. Think of enterprise-grade server hardware suppliers: Dell, HP, and many more. If designed or assembled in the US, the price increase will be passed on to EU buyers. US-based providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud may pass infrastructure cost increases to customers. Given that such providers already offer top-of-market pricing as a general rule, the days of cheap hyperscale cloud might be over—at least for Europe. GPUs (think Nvidia, AMD) are mostly fabbed in Asia but are still designed in the US, and some are caught up in the tariff dragnet. Even where there’s an exemption, future uncertainty makes long-term AI projects riskier to plan and even more expensive to execute. Finally, a silver lining. Tariff-driven cost increases could tip the scales in favour of European cloud and AI providers—assuming they can scale up fast enough. We may see a minor renaissance in EU cloud adoption purely out of necessity.  Here are a few EU alternatives to the big three US-based cloud providers:  France, Netherlands, Poland  Germany, Finland, Singapore, USA Organisations that are already multi-cloud or experimenting with sovereign or local clouds have a head start. This is the moment for strategic decoupling from US services—if possible in your stack. Data centre expansion plansBetween tariffs on steel and electronics, the cost of building AI-ready infrastructure just jumped. Microsoft has already scaled back projects, and others are expected to follow. It should be mentioned that the scaling back of data centres is also impacted by the proliferation of cheaper Chinese AI models, not just international trade wars. Startups and small playersAre you a European startup selling into the US, using AWS, paying for Nvidia compute, and backed by American VC? These are three pressure points now affected by tariffs or looming countermeasures. Expect reduced margins, longer sales cycles, and a harder pitch. US VCs may withdraw from Europe, and European corporates may delay AI and cloud spending. If the EU retaliates with restrictions on US digital services, that fog of uncertainty only thickens. What about AI Agents, specifically?Increased Development Costs: AI agents need much computing power for training and operation. This power comes from servers, GPUs, and other specialized processors.  Tariffs on servers and other hardware will increase the cost of this kit, directly increasing the cost of developing and deploying AI agents. Higher Operational Expenses: Many AI agents operate in the cloud, utilizing services from providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. This means that the ongoing operational costs for AI agents that rely on this cloud infrastructure will also rise. Increased costs can lead to reduced investment in research and development. If acquiring the necessary hardware and cloud resources becomes more expensive, companies may have to scale back their AI agent projects, potentially slowing down innovation in the field.Impact on Specialized Hardware: Advanced AI agents often require specialized hardware, such as high-performance GPUs. The tariffs on these components will likely affect the cost and availability of these crucial components, further hindering development. What Should You Be Doing?Review your cloud spend exposure. You're at risk if you’re an EU company and your stack is 100% US hyperscaler. At minimum, map your dependencies. More realistically, have at least a plan to migrate at least some of your workloads to EU-based providers. Ask your vendors how they’re responding. Will they absorb the costs, pass them on, or localise operations?Reexamine your hardware sourcing..Watch for EU countermeasures. These might include digital services tariffs, procurement restrictions, or new data localisation rules. This is more than a trade spat.These tariffs may be the starting pistol for a more fragmented AI and cloud market, where regional resilience becomes as essential as scale.  If your current strategy assumes infinite cheap GPU compute and seamless cross-border tech collaboration, it’s time to rethink. Start by asking: how much of your AI stack relies on infrastructure 6,000km away and suddenly 20% more expensive?  This isn’t a drill. It’s a new reality. Want to become strategically nimble enough to profit from the geopolitical climate?Temrel is an AI Automation and Workflow partner.

Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to meet face to face with President Trump since he announced his sweeping new tariffs. The two also discussed efforts to secure the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, as well as tensions with Iran.

"China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end."Last Friday, China's Finance Ministry announced 34% in additional tariffs on all goods imported from the U.S., starting April 10, in retaliation for Trump imposing new levies of 34% on China.The across-the-board tariffs followed two previous rounds of 10%-15% tariffs, targeting mostly agricultural and energy products imported from the U.S. The broadened tariff scope reflects the Chinese leadership's diminished hopes for a trade deal with the U.S., said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at Teneo.Trump's 34% tariffs on China were on top of the 20% duties rolled out since February, bringing the total new tariffs this year on China to 54%. The additional levies have lifted the U.S. weighted average tariff rate on China to as high as 65%, and could dent China's economy by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year, according to Morgan Stanley."Since China already faces more than 60% in tariff rate, it doesn't really matter if it goes up by 50% or 500%," said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting Beijing is prepared for a "full on" trade war with the U.S."China is on the defensive side, but basically the two sides are testing each other's limit," Xu said.As risks of an intense U.S.-China trade war rise, Beijing might resort to further retaliatory measures, such as stopping purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, matching U.S. tariffs, and further expansion of export controls on metals and minerals, Xu added.The People's Bank of China on Tuesday set the midpoint rate for onshore yuanat 7.2038 per dollar, the weakest level since September 2023, according to data provider Wind Information. The yuan is allowed to trade within a 2% band of this midpoint rate.The yuan's weakening is a "big signal," Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia," "this is Beijing politely saying this is getting a little too much, we are putting you on notice, we can devalue if we want and bigger things may come if you keep this up.""This is a clear shot across the bow of Washington," Brooks added.Chinese onshore yuan weakened as much as 0.39% to 7.3363 per dollar, while the offshore yuan was little changed.U.S. State Department did not respond to CNBC's request for comment."Escalation is probably the only short-term outcome, but negotiations will ultimately come as both sides feel the pinch of the economic slowdown," Xu said.At a regular news conference on Tuesday, Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said Beijing would take "necessary measures" against U.S. tariff threats, according to a CNBC translation of reports in Chinese state media.He reiterated the Commerce Ministry's statement, "If U.S. insists on waging a tariff war, a trade war, China will fight till the end."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;We lost everything,&apos; Congo flood survivors say | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uldn_FsyVfg</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Uldn_FsyVfg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 01:10:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Residents of Kinshasa recounted harrowing experiences of survival after severe flooding swept through parts of the Congo's capital, killing dozens and leaving many more displaced.

Here in Europe, Germany's DAX plunged 10% on opening, before finishing the day more than 4% in the red. And there were similar losses in France and the UK. 

Against the backdrop of crashing stock markets and economic uncertainty, EU trade ministers gathered in Luxembourg to discuss their response to Washington's new trade regime. Starting on Wednesday, the EU will face tariffs of 20% on almost all exports to the United States. 

Donald Trump's levies are causing anxiety and anger in European capitals. The transatlantic trade relationship is the biggest in the world, worth 1.5 trillion euros. European officials say they would rather talk than fight the US on tariffs, but if push comes to shove all options are on the table.

Implementation will begin on a staggered timeline, from April 15 through December 1. Some items, such as soyabeans and almonds, won’t be affected until December, following pressure from farmers concerned about animal feed costs.US President Donald Trump had previously warned that if bourbon were targeted, he’d respond with a 200 per cent tariff on European alcohol.EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, speaking ahead of the list being distributed to member governments on Monday, said the commission had taken national concerns into account. The result is a scaled-back response, covering fewer goods than the initial €26bn of US imports that were originally in scope after Washington’s blanket 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium.“We’re not here to match move for move or dollar for dollar,” Šefčovič said.EU governments are expected to sign off on the revised list by Wednesday.Meanwhile, Trump has declared plans for an additional 20 per cent tariff on all European exports.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that Brussels has consistently offered the US a tariff-free agreement on industrial goods, especially cars, stressing that “Europe is always ready to strike a fair deal, and that offer remains on the table.”Germany’s economy minister criticized what he saw as self-interested lobbying from fellow EU countries, saying the bloc should present a united front under the commission’s leadership on trade.“Markets are already reeling, and the damage could escalate,” said Robert Habeck ahead of an EU trade ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. “We must act with clarity and unity—and that starts with recognising our strength and America’s vulnerability.”“If each country defends its own niche—red wine here, whiskey or pistachios there—we’ll achieve nothing,” he added.Still, Europe’s drinks industry will welcome the revisions if finalized. Many producers are already suffering from Trump’s original tariffs, a sluggish global market, and trade tensions with China.France’s wine and spirits sector stood to lose the most from the planned duties, according to industry body Fevs, which warned that EU alcohol exports could fall by €1.6bn—half of that from France—impacting jobs and economic output.“This trade dispute produces only losers, on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Fevs president Gabriel Picard. “Our longstanding US partners are sharing this concern with their own government.”Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is expected to travel to Washington “in the coming weeks” as part of a broader EU effort to convince the US to walk back the 20 per cent tariffs, Italy’s foreign minister said Monday.Antonio Tajani added that Rome’s goal is a mutual “zero tariff-zero tariff” agreement, but as a step toward that, hopes the US might at least reduce its reciprocal tariffs on European goods to 10 per cent.The US spirits industry has also pushed back against global alcohol tariffs, highlighting that 86 per cent of American exports go to countries that have already eliminated tariffs on US spirits.“The US spirits sector has long been a model of open, fair trade,” said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, last week.In 2018, the EU imposed a 25 per cent retaliatory tariff on US whiskey, leading exports to fall by 20 per cent—from $552mn in 2018 to $440mn by 2021.Following the suspension of those tariffs, US whiskey exports to the EU rebounded nearly 60 per cent, rising from $439mn in 2021 to $699mn in 2024, according to industry data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Senator Warren Says Tariffs Putting US on Precipice of Recession</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSsnIRJgEzw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lSsnIRJgEzw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 21:31:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, criticizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and says Congress needs to step up and put a halt to the Trump administration's tariffs on "Balance of Power."

Demonstrators say the activists from Ireland, Poland and the US were unfairly targeted for their political activism. German authorities claim the activists resisted arrest during protests and engaged in supporting a banned terrorist group, but none of them have been convicted. It's the first time that German authorities are attempting to deport foreign nationals who are in Germany legally in connection with pro-Palestinian activism.

Das geht auch Dank großer Lagerbestände in den USA. 
Anders als viele andere deutsche Autobauer hat Audi keine eigenen Fabriken in den USA - sämtliche Fahrzeuge für den US-Markt muss das Unternehmen importieren. Nun hat Audi alle Lieferungen in die USA gestoppt. Grund sind die von US-Präsident Trump in der vergangenen Woche weltweit verhängten Zölle.
Laut einem Bericht der Automobilwoche gilt dies für alle Fahrzeuge, die nach dem 2. April in die USA geliefert wurden. Fahrzeuge, die davor eingetroffen sind, sollen demnach planmäßig ausgeliefert werden. Das Branchenportal berief sich dabei auf ein internes Schreiben an die Händler. Eine Unternehmenssprecherin hat dies inzwischen bestätigt.
Audi liefert seine Fahrzeuge in die USA aus Deutschland, Ungarn und der Slowakei. In Mexiko wird zudem das Modell "Q5" gefertigt - ein Verkaufsschlager in den USA.Mehr als 37.000 Audis in den USA auf Lager
Audi hat dem Bericht zufolge mehr als 37.000 Autos in den USA auf Lager. Diese Fahrzeuge sind nicht von den neuen Zöllen betroffen. Sie sollen im Bestand und beim Verkauf besonders gekennzeichnet werden. Das Unternehmen will den Händlern zudem in der kommenden Woche ein sogenanntes Zoll-Toolkit bereitstellen, das kurzfristige Kommunikationsstrategien und Verkaufsimpulse für den aktuellen Bestand liefern soll.
Audi will laut dem Bericht die Auswirkungen der neuen Importzölle auf das Geschäft analysieren. Das Unternehmen wolle sich darauf konzentrieren, die Auswirkungen auf Kunden und Handelspartner zu minimieren und das eigene Händlernetz bestmöglich zu unterstützen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Not Looking to Pause Tariffs for Negotiations</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dJN87ULuV8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_dJN87ULuV8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 20:04:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump says he's not looking to pause his tariffs plan.

When staff, including the night manager, attempted to persuade the agent to return to his room, the agent became physically aggressive. Police were then called. The agent engaged in an altercation with numerous police officers, leading to his arrest. The agent was released from police custody later that day after intervention by the U.S. Embassy.Four sources told the that Rubio’s protective detail is under severe strain and has been stretched to a near-breaking point by senior leadership. One source provided explicit examples of how resource stretches have led to vulnerabilities in protection. One State Department employee observed that “shift supervisors [on Rubio’s detail] have an incomprehensible workload. They are responsible for all the agents under them, scheduling, evaluations and a preposterous amount of admin work [as well as] performing the actual shift work. They work 6 to 7 days a week. I truly believe this [incident] was the result of incomprehensible strain [the agent] was placed under and, at the very least, [Diplomatic Security Service] owes [the agent] a very fair evaluation of these circumstances in their totality – looking deep into [DSS’s] own role [in what happened].”A State Department spokesman told the , “The Diplomatic Security Service is aware of allegations of an incident involving an employee in Brussels, Belgium on March 31, 2025. While we don’t discuss specific personnel matters, the allegations are being examined.” The Belgian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment. Brussels police initially said, “Are you requesting confirmation of the arrest? Please note that we cannot provide details about the circumstances,” but failed to respond to follow-up inquiries. The Hotel Amigo and its ownership did not respond to multiple requests for comment.DSS is responsible for protecting American diplomats and diplomatic compounds around the world and investigating crimes such as passport and visa fraud. But while once regarded as a highly prestigious law enforcement agency, DSS has suffered several embarrassments in recent years.As the has reported, these incidents have included numerous leadership failures. Field operations have also suffered. In December 2022, agents assigned to a full-time protective detail for former Trump administration U.S. Special Representative to Iran Brian Hook failed to prevent the theft of two of his vehicles from his driveway. One of those vehicles was later used in a homicide in Washington, D.C. Four active or recently retired DSS employees have told the  they believe one problem is the tendency of more senior agents to refuse to join or support “hump agent” domestic protective details alongside more junior agents. Last November, DSS agents on a protection detail for U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy were instrumental in detaining a serial killer in New York City. The agents responsible felt let down when leadership failed to give them due credit.Further, unlike local U.S. law enforcement agencies supporting security at last summer’s Paris Olympic Games, DSS failed to secure authorization for its agents protecting American athletes at the Games to carry firearms. DSS has also attracted controversy for expensive diversity, equity, and inclusion-related trips under former DSS Director Carlos Matus. Matus now serves as DSS’s senior-most official as the acting assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. Correspondence seen by theand conversations with both active and former DSS agents indicate that Matus has repeatedly failed to clarify for DSS personnel how their jobs and responsibilities may be affected by Trump administration policy changes. This includes a failure to respond regarding specific concerns raised by the DSS president for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.There is no indication that the incident on Monday caused Rubio’s security to be compromised. Still, it has reinforced sentiments inside and outside of DSS that it is only a matter of time until a protective mission failure occurs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tesla&apos;s Future Determined by How Elon Musk Handles the Next 90 Days: Dan Ives</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJAu7ByJje8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sJAu7ByJje8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 19:49:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tesla's stock price dropped 9.2% to $217.41 amid a global equity market selloff, contradicting Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's prediction that it would never fall below a certain price again.
The decline follows a 40% price target cut by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, citing Trump's trade policies and a brand crisis created by Elon Musk, and a weak first-quarter vehicle delivery report.
Analysts have lowered their estimates for Tesla's sales and earnings, citing concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs, particularly in China, where Musk's association with the US president may drive consumers to prefer domestic brands.

Dan Ives, Global Head of Technology at Wedbush Securities, joins to discuss Tesla’s fall, big tech movers and his recent note: “Tech Investors Tariff Policy Creates Mass Uncertainty/Pain”

Describing it as “a march towards independence,” Lagarde said Europe must build its own alternative to secure financial sovereignty. A fully unified capital market, she added, could pave the way for deeper fiscal integration — with a potential value add of up to €3 trillion annually.Speaking on The Pat Kenny Show, Lagarde underscored Europe’s dependence on foreign digital payment infrastructure. “Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Alipay are all controlled by American or Chinese companies,” she noted, arguing, “We should make sure there is a European offer.”Her comments come amid renewed focus on the Capital Markets Union (CMU) — a long-standing EU initiative aimed at creating a single capital market across member states. The goal is to improve the flow of investments and savings across the bloc, giving businesses better access to funding and citizens more efficient savings vehicles.Lagarde linked progress on the CMU to broader economic integration, saying it could ease the pressure on monetary policy and lay the groundwork for a future fiscal union. While the claim of €3 trillion in annual added value stems from a widely cited Reddit post, more official estimates suggest a slightly more conservative impact. According to the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS), deeper integration could generate over €2.8 trillion in additional GDP by 2032, with at least €321 billion attributed to completing the Economic and Monetary Union.Still, building a European alternative to Visa and Mastercard faces steep challenges. Among them:Lower interchange fees in Europe make profitability harder to achieve.Massive upfront investment is needed to create infrastructure that rivals global players.Adoption hurdles include shifting consumer and merchant behavior, and persuading banks to support a new system.Technical complexity, especially around security, fraud protection, and cross-border compatibility.Governance and coordination, as member states and institutions would need to align on execution and oversight.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Hakeem Jeffries holds a press conference</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejZ41i2HA5I</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ejZ41i2HA5I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 18:19:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and other leaders hold a press conference in Washington, D.C.
