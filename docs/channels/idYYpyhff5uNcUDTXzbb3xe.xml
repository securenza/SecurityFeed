US and Russian representatives have met in Riyadh. The Kremlin says it shares the US view that the war needs to end, but says there are many "nuances" to be worked out. Despite the talks, Russia and Ukraine have continued to trade drone and missile strikes. Ukrainian officials said a missile attack on Sumy in northeastern Ukraine wounded 65 people, including more than a dozen children. 

Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelenskyy said his country remains open to a ceasefire, but that those efforts are being blocked by Russia.

She and some colleagues are taking legal action to fight for the existence of VOA and its sister organizations. In an extensive interview with DW's Ines Pohl, she explains how the Trump administration's actions have resulted in the silencing of the Voice of America (VOA), impacting its role as a crucial source of information for a global audience. Widakuswara and her colleagues are taking legal action to challenge the administration's efforts to undermine VOA, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights and constitutes executive overreach.

She says that the absence of VOA leaves a significant gap in international broadcasting, which is being exploited by adversaries like Russia and extremist organizations, potentially spreading misinformation.

In her opinion the current situation poses a broader threat to journalism in the U.S., with increased restrictions affecting not only VOA but also other media outlets, contributing to a climate of fear among journalists. The discussion highlights the plight of vulnerable journalists, particularly those on J-1 visas, who face dangerous consequences if forced to return to their home countries due to job losses at VOA.

On Facebook, she had interacted with Katrin Ivanova and Biser Dzhambazov.We then found she was an airline worker.According to her Linkedin profile, she has held positions in ticket sales for travel companies. Bulgarian company filings say she is the sole owner of International Aviation Consult.Screen captures of travel data found on a hard drive belonging to cell leader Roussev were from airline industry software known as "Amadeus".On her LinkedIn profile, we found Ms Gencheva noted her proficiency with the software.After the BBC's research identified Ms Gencheva, a source confirmed to the BBC that she is known to the Bulgarian security services as being connected to the spy network. She is not charged with any offence.We contacted Ms Gencheva on a Bulgarian phone number she uses for real estate work. She hung up when informed the call was from BBC News and was being recorded, not even waiting for an explanation of what we were calling about.In response to a letter setting out the evidence relating to her, she said she did "not wish to comment on the case" and did not consent for her name to be used. Writing in Bulgarian, she claimed not to speak English well. However, her public LinkedIn profile lists her English ability as "full professional proficiency" and says she has studied in English to degree level.Ms Doncheva helped spy on the investigative journalist Christo Grozev in Vienna, occupying a flat opposite where he lived and operating a camera that took images of his home.She was paid to conduct an anti-Ukraine propaganda campaign, which included putting stickers on locations including Vienna's Soviet war memorial and was intended to make supporters of Ukraine appear like neo-Nazis.The BBC identified Ms Doncheva through her social media profiles after the Old Bailey trial heard about a "Tsveti" who had worked with the cell. Sources in Austria then confirmed her identity.In Vienna, she met at least three of those convicted of spying in the UK case - Vanya Gaberova, Biser Dzhambazov and Katrin Ivanova.Senior Austrian officials, including the head of the Secret Service Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, were among those selected for surveillance by Ms Doncheva, alongside the Austrian investigative journalist Anna Thalhammer, who has written about Russian espionage.Ms Doncheva, who is unemployed, was arrested by Austrian police in December.Court documents first reported by the Austrian magazines Profil and Falter, and later seen by the BBC, reveal she is "strongly suspected of having committed the crime of secret intelligence to the detriment of Austria".She told investigators she conducted surveillance after being asked by long-time friend Vanya Gaberova - one of the six Bulgarians awaiting sentencing. She said Gaberova provided her with a list of names, addresses and photographs.She initially told police she had been misled by the others, who first told her they were conducting a "student project" and later that they were working for Interpol. But Austrian investigators are recorded as saying it is "incomprehensible" that Ms Doncheva believed such "dubious stories".The documents say the intelligence cell in which Ms Doncheva operated was ultimately controlled by Jan Marsalek from Moscow on behalf of the Russian intelligence services and that evidence seized by investigators shows she was contracted by Marsalek and the UK cell leader Orlin Roussev.The documents say Marsalek directed that Anna Thalhammer be targeted. Ms Doncheva admitted to police she had photographed the journalist's then workplace and sought to watch her from a nearby restaurant.Ms Thalhammer, now editor of Austrian news magazine Profil, told the BBC she was first told about being spied on last year by police, and she is now aware of being watched for some time."She obviously sat in front of the office in a very nice fish restaurant. I really can recommend it. She complained that it's too expensive, that she needs more money. She got that money."She says "that woman" also spied on a number of "high-ranked people".Ms Thalhammer does not know where else she was followed, but that some of her sources were identified and attempts were made to break into their homes.She says "Vienna is the capital of spies" but no one has been sentenced in the city for espionage and the "law here is great for spies"."I'm frustrated and I'm also honestly a little bit scared," she added. "I live alone with my daughter. It's not so nice to know that the state doesn't take care if somebody is threatening journalists, politicians or anybody else."A prolific social media user - even her cat has a TikTok account - Ms Doncheva posted a photo of herself on Facebook in a Vladimir Putin T-shirt in 2022 and 2023. When someone commented that in Russia a large percentage of women want to have Putin's baby, Ms Doncheva replied saying not only in Russia, followed by a lip-licking emoji.Ms Doncheva denied being herself when approached by the BBC in a Vienna street and refused to answer questions, but we have verified that the woman was indeed Ms Doncheva.Watch: Tsvetanka Doncheva was approached by the BBC in ViennaWhen approached, she was wearing clothes and carrying items seen in Ms Doncheva's social media posts: a distinctive blue tracksuit, a pair of glasses, and a patterned mobile phone case. We also observed her entering Ms Doncheva's registered home address less than 20 minutes after she denied being Ms Doncheva.She has not responded to a letter offering her a chance to comment.The two women worked alongside the six Bulgarians who were convicted of conspiring to spy for Russia.A cache of almost 80,000 Telegram messages between Roussev and his controller Marsalek was recovered by UK police.The messages revealed multiple operations carried out by the cell in the years before February 2023, when their activities were disrupted by police.The UK-based spies even targeted Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military base in Germany. Roussev and Marsalek discussed kidnapping and killing journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov.Unlike the six spies convicted in the UK, Ms Doncheva and Ms Gencheva are not in custody and have not been convicted of any offence.The Austrian public prosecutor's request for pre-trial detention of Ms Doncheva was rejected and she was released.Austrian court documents state there is "no risk" of Ms Doncheva absconding because she is "socially integrated" in the country and cares for her mother, and that a risk of further crime is not particularly high given the imprisonment in the UK of others involved,Ms Thalhammer told the BBC she "can't understand" why the person who spied on her was released."Maybe [they] shouldn't believe everything a spy says." She said the Austrian secret service thinks there are other spy cells and that their activity has continued after the arrest of the six Bulgarians in the UK.Ms Gencheva has remained free in Bulgaria, publicly presenting herself as an experienced airline and travel industry professional.After being contacted by the BBC, Ms Gencheva changed her profile name on Facebook and LinkedIn. She continues to list her proficiency with the Amadeus airline software.If you have information about this story or a similar one that you would like to share with the BBC News Investigations team please get in touch.

Protesters gathered outside the Istanbul city hall for a sixth day of protest on Monday evening, in defiance of a ban on rallies. They're angry about the arrest of Ekrem İmamoğlu - the mayor of Istanbul and a key political rival of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Demonstrators accuse the Turkish president of trying to remove a major opponent ahead of elections in 2028. Mr İmamoğlu was taken into custody pending trial on corruption charges. 

With more protests in major cities expected, we've been hearing from people out on the streets of Istanbul.

"We obviously cannot take your word for it," Jarlov wrote in his post.He added that the US could scupper Copenhagen's use of the F-35 just by stopping the supply of spare parts — a similar dilemma that Ukraine faced when Washington temporarily paused military aid."I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse," wrote Jarlov, who is also his party's spokesperson for his stance on Greenland's affairs.Jarlov further accused the US of wanting "to strengthen Russia and weaken Europa.""Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible," he said."I encourage our friends and allies to do the same," Jarlov added.Denmark announced in 2016 that it was spending about $3 billion on 27 F-35s to replace its aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. Jarlov was serving as Denmark's defense committee chairman at the time.Copenhagen has received 17 of its orders so far.His comments come as President Donald Trump has said that he wants to buy or annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that's rich in minerals and can provide the US with a strategic location near the Arctic.Leaders in both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly resisted Trump's statements, saying their governments had no interest in the territory coming under US administration or rule."There is no threat from China against Greenland and China has no presence in Greenland," Jarlov wrote on Sunday. "The only threat against Greenland is the USA."Meanwhile, Second Lady Usha Vance, White House national security advisor Mike Waltz, and the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are expected to visit Greenland on Thursday.Denmark isn't the only country reconsidering its defense reliance on US exports. Leaders in Portugal and Canada have also said they are reviewing their willingness to buy the F-35 amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and its allies.At least 19 governments, including the UK, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Australia, and Israel, have agreed to purchase the F-35.The F-35 is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, and while it has several competitors, its stealth features have been dominant in the market. Other planes considered adjacent or similar in capability are China's Chengdu J-20 and the French Dassault Rafale, which a British think tank said has recently surged in popularity as US ties with its allies fray.South Korea is also developing the KF-21 Boramae, but its stealth systems are expected to be less advanced than the F-35's.Lockheed Martin, the State Department, the Pentagon, and Jarlov did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wildfires in South Korea lead to fatalities | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pvox7yGWuc</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-pvox7yGWuc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At least four people have died in wildfires in South Korea, with six others injured, five of them seriously.

He has been considered an important partner: a fellow populist at the heart of Europe, within NATO. Orban wants to show the world he still is important to President Trump. But it appears Trump doesn't need Orban within the EU - because he’s ignoring Europe. At the first pre-peace-talks meeting in Saudi Arabia in February, the US and Russia not only excluded Ukraine, they also didn’t invite the Europeans. And if Trump really does want a friend in Europe, these days there are other candidates to choose from. Orban may have been the trailblazer for illiberalism and radical populist policies in modern-day Europe. But he’s no longer the only one. And the others are in more important EU countries: Italy, and the biggest of all: Germany. DW's Senior International Correspondent Fanny Facsar travels to Washington D.C., Brussels and Budapest to explore the changing dynamics of the Trump-Orbán relationship in light of shifting geopolitical strategies.

The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.This is going to require some explaining.The story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis—an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam”—soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.This is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”The term  generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.One minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”That was the end of the Thursday text chain.After receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of  in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.The next day, things got even stranger.At 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”At this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”A person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”Then, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.At 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”The Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”A few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”The account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”At this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”That message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”After reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched . Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.I went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.On Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s  and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.There was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”Shane Harris contributed reporting. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine’s most dangerous city craves relief from killer drones | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYUGvy6gkI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1IYUGvy6gkI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:53:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ukrainian city of Kherson, continually targeted by Russian drone attacks, is seeking respite.

Two sworn statements filed in federal court late Wednesday show that the SSA has staffed up in recent weeks to include four special government employees and six more DOGE staffers on loan from other departments.

Their mission: detecting waste, fraud and abuse in the nation’s 90-year-old social insurance agency.
Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” and suggested this week that there could be as much as $700 billion a year in entitlement fraud. Critics have said he is setting up a move to cut the popular program. Others are concerned about Musk’s team having access to Americans’ most sensitive data.

Ernie Tedeschi, Director of Economics at the Yale Budget Lab, discusses the inflationary risks of rising federal deficits and debt, and explains why his team thinks the social security program will go broke if not properly addressed in the near-term. Ernie speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said."If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs," Trump said during a press conference at the White House. Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year."This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China," Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC. crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S.  crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87."We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation," analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.The U.S. was the second-largest destination for Venezuelan crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to Kpler. India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office. The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.Chevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told The Wall Street Journal. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting "irregular warfare" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.Federal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked Trump's calls for Boasberg to be removed.Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVEJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

This was a lie, yet the US President continued to amplify it.The President of Ukraine added that American officials began to believe Putin at his word, even when their own intelligence contradicted the Russian dictator's statements."I believe Russia has managed to influence some people on the White House team through information. Their signal to the Americans was that the Ukrainians do not want to end the war, and something should be done to force them," Zelenskyy stated.Witkoff's statements about 'referendum'It is also worth mentioning the recent scandalous statements by Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Witkoff claimed that the "biggest problem" in the full-scale war in Ukraine is "Donbas, Crimea, Luhansk, and two other (regions - ed.)." According to him, these territories are supposedly "Russian-speaking" and "referendums" were held there during which "the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Wants to Break Canada, Prime Minister Carney Says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmiHVNeDJq8</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rmiHVNeDJq8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:29:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says America will never own Canada. “Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us," Carney said on March 23.

India accounts for more than a quarter of cases - despite setting a goal of eliminating TB by the end of this year. 
Critics say that's unrealistic - thanks to low government spending and shortage of medicines. DW Correspondent Adil Bhat has been to Faridabad in the northern state of Haryana to meet patients fighting the disease - and the challenges that remain in combating this epidemic.

Demonstrators accuse the Turkish president of trying to get rid of a major opponent ahead of elections in 2028. Imamoglu was taken into custody pending a trial on corruption charges.

Kyiv supported a mutual halt on energy strikes but accused Russia of continuing attacks against Ukraine's civilian targets.Washington and Kyiv previously backed a broader 30-day ceasefire that would include ground operations, but Moscow rejected the proposal unless it included a halt on foreign military support for Ukraine and other conditions that would weaken Kyiv's ability to defend itself.Sources close to Trump told the Telegraph that he remains committed to brokering a ceasefire but is growing impatient.Despite this, White House officials, "those closest to the president," reportedly maintain a calm atmosphere and urge patience with the process.Meanwhile, Russian forces continue heavy attacks on Ukrainian cities. At least four people were killed and 13 injured in Russian strikes over the past day, regional officials reported on March 24.Kyiv has also reportedly launched strikes against Russia. Ukrainian drones attacked the Kavkazskaya oil pumping station in Russia's Krasnodar Krai on March 19, causing a fire that firefighters are still battling five days later, Russian authorities claimed.On March 21, Russia also accused Ukraine of shelling the Sudzha gas metering station in Kursk Oblast, a key transit facility for Russian gas exports to Europe. Ukraine's General Staff denied the claim, accusing Moscow of staging a provocation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>German AI boss: &apos;Drone wall&apos; on NATO eastern flank possible in a year</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/german-ai-boss-drone-wall-092424016.html</link><author>/u/treebeard87_vn</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:26:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[German defence company Helsing is calling for the swift establishment of an effective conventional deterrent on NATO's eastern flank using new types of combat drones."A drone wall could be erected within a year. You also need reconnaissance systems, satellites and probably reconnaissance drones," Gundbert Scherf, co-founder and co-chief executive of the Munich-based enterprise, told dpa on Sunday.However, Scherf believes the entire concept of modern-day defence would first need a major rethink."At the moment, the debate is still like the Cold War," he argued. "We're counting armoured systems, aircraft and ships on the other side and seeing if we can somehow get close to parity with a lot of money. And I think that's the wrong way round."Helsing specializes in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for the defence industry.It has developed the HX-2 drone - initially for use in Ukraine - which employs AI to guide explosive charges to a target and is less susceptible to electronic interference.The company has established a partnership with French space start-up Loft Orbital to monitor borders and troop movements using reconnaissance satellites.With the Swedish manufacturer Saab, preparations are being made to install an AI application for air combat in the Gripen fighter jet.Helsing also plans to present an autonomous system for use at sea soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greenland condemns planned visits by Usha Vance and Trump adviser</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0718g3jwo?xtor=AL-71-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bbbc.news.twitter%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bnews%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D&amp;amp;at_medium=social&amp;amp;at_link_id=DDA11C78-08A6-11F0-9109-9DB5C646837B&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;amp;at_format=link&amp;amp;at_campaign=Social_Flow&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=editorial&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=twitter&amp;amp;at_link_type=web_link&amp;amp;at_link_origin=BBCWorld</link><author>/u/sh0tgunben</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:20:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Greenland's politicians have condemned plans for high-profile US visits, in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.Second Lady Usha Vance will make a cultural visit this week, and a separate trip is expected from Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede described the plan as aggressive, and said the duo had not been invited for meetings. Meanwhile, the island's likely next leader accused the US of showing a lack of respect.Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.Watch: Greenland is 'in our future,' says TrumpIt governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest - and has had a military base on the island since World War Two.It is also thought Trump is interested in the island's rare earth minerals. His son Donald Jr visited Greenland before Trump's inauguration in January. Announcing Mrs Vance's visit, the White House said the second lady would visit historical sites and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.Her delegation - including her son - would be there to "celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity", the statement said.Waltz's trip was confirmed by a source who spoke to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He is expected to visit before Mrs Vance and to travel with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, according to the New York Times.  Outgoing PM Egede described Waltz's visit in particular as a provocation. "What is the security advisor doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us," he told Sermitsiaq newspaper. Speaking to the same paper, Greenland's probable next PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen accused the American officials of showing the local population a lack of respect.US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the United States has a vested interest in the Arctic, and so "it should not be a surprise the National Security Advisor and Secretary of Energy are visiting a US Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground". He said that the visit is also an opportunity to " build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation" and to "learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people". Trump appeared to escalate his campaign to take over the island during a conversation with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte earlier this month.Greenland was already on the defensive about Trump's talk of a takeover, but he sent further shockwaves by implying he might ask to take the island with support of Nato, a military alliance of which Denmark is also a part."You know, Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favourite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful," Trump said. "We'll be talking to you."When asked about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: "I think that will happen."The move prompted Greenland's leading political parties to issue a joint statement to condemn the American president's "unacceptable behaviour".The issue took centre-stage in the recent election, during which Egede's governing Inuit Ataqatigiit party was defeated in a surprise result by Nielsen's Democratic party, which favours a gradual approach to independence from Denmark.Earlier this month, during a speech to the US Congress, Trump said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future. "If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," he said.According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.Watch: Danish journalist on what Greenlanders think about Trump's comments]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Market Talk: PMI data does &apos;give some hope&apos; for Europe&apos;s economy | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tcp3lZcTI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M8tcp3lZcTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:06:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest PMI data showed that the euro zone business activity grew at its fastest pace in seven months in March.

Steve Daines, a close ally of President Donald Trump, laid out the condition in meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing over the weekend. 
That contrasts with China’s claim that it has already forcefully cracked down on the fentanyl trade.

            Greenland’s prime minister said a planned visit to the island by US officials, including second lady Usha Vance, is “highly aggressive,” plunging relations to a new low after President Donald Trump vowed to annex the autonomous Danish territory.
    
            But despite the backlash, Trump has insisted the visit is about “friendliness, not provocation” – and claims the US team was “invited.”
    
            Vance, the wife of US Vice President JD Vance, will travel to Greenland this week to watch the island’s national dogsled race and “celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” according to a statement from the White House. National security adviser Mike Waltz is also expected to visit the territory this week, according to a source familiar with the trip.
    
            Greenland Prime Minister Mute B. Egede called the US delegation’s trip to the island “highly aggressive” in an interview with Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq on Sunday, and raised particular objection to Waltz’s visit.
    
            “What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,” Egede said. “His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump’s mission — and the pressure will increase.”
    
            Trump claimed on Monday that people in Greenland have responded warmly to the US’s recent interest in the territory. “They’re calling us. We’re not calling them. And we were invited over there,” he said.
    
             “We’re dealing with a lot of people from Greenland that would like to see something happen with respect to them being properly protected and properly taken care of,” Trump told reporters following a meeting with his Cabinet.
    
            “I think Greenland is going to be something that maybe is in our future,” Trump added.
    
            The president said he believes Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be traveling to Greenland too.
    
            Trump’s idea to annex Greenland has thrown an international spotlight on the territory, which holds vast stores of rare earth minerals critical for high-tech industries, and has raised questions about the island’s future security as the US, Russia and China vie for influence in the Arctic. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in the US taking the island by force or economic coercion, even as Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected the idea.
    
            “I think we’re going to get it one way or the other,” Trump said during remarks to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.
    
            Egede, who has pushed for Greenland’s independence from Denmark, said Greenlanders’ effort to be diplomatic just “bounces off Donald Trump and his administration in their mission to own and control Greenland.”
    
            Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who is likely to be Greenland’s next leader after his party won the election, said the timing of the American visit shows “a lack of respect.”
    
            “The fact that the Americans know very well that we are still in a negotiating situation and that the municipal elections have not yet concluded, they still capitalize on the moment to come to Greenland, once again, which shows a lack of respect for the Greenlandic population,” Nielsen told Sermitsiaq.
    
            The White House presented Vance’s visit as a cultural one, and said the second lady “will travel to Greenland with her son and a United States delegation to visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland’s national dogsled race.”
    
            “Ms. Vance and the delegation are excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” the White House statement said.
    
            It is unclear whether the US has ever sent a delegation to the dogsled race, much less a group featuring a second lady.
    
            Denmark ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953, when the island achieved greater powers of self-governance. In 2009, it gained more powers pertaining to minerals, policing and courts of law, but Denmark still controls security, defense, foreign and monetary policy. Greenland also benefits from Denmark’s European Union and NATO memberships.
    
            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a written comment to Reuters that the visit of the US delegation is “something we take seriously.” She said Denmark wants to cooperate with the US, but that should be based on “the fundamental rules of sovereignty.”
    
            While Greenlandic politicians have repeatedly signaled they are opposed to annexation, they are open to deals with the United States for rare earth mining, expanding tourism, stronger diplomatic connections and other investments.
    
            A poll in January, commissioned by Danish and Greenlandic newspapers, found that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to become part of the US, with nearly half saying Trump’s interest was a threat, Reuters reported.
    
            The president’s son Donald Trump, Jr. made headlines with a visit to Greenland in January.
    
            “Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. Make Greenland Great Again!” Trump Jr. posted on social media at the time.

The Kyiv Post was unable to independently verify the video’s location or timing.The report specifies that the Ka-52 is an attack helicopter used by Russia for reconnaissance and striking ground targets. In contrast, the Mi-8 transport helicopters are deployed to move personnel and cargo and support ground operations.According to open sources, a Ka-52 helicopter costs approximately $16 million, and an Mi-8 around $8 million.As reported by Kyiv Post, the Kamaz Ka-52 Alligator is widely regarded by military analysts as one of the world’s top attack helicopters, thanks to its counter-rotating rotors, advanced targeting systems, heavy armor, and powerful weaponry.Designed for a two-person crew, the Ka-52 is heavily promoted for its Vikhr attack missile, which Moscow claims can destroy a tank from a distance of 10 km. This allows Ka-52 gunners to hit targets beyond the range of many battlefield point-defense systems such as MANPADS.According to Forbes, Ka-52 helicopters were likely responsible for some of Ukraine’s equipment losses during the 2023 counteroffensive, using their long-range missiles to engage targets while hovering over the battlefield.The Mi-8 (NATO designation: Hip) is a versatile twin-engine helicopter developed by the Mil Design Bureau in the early 1960s. It is one of the most widely produced helicopters in aviation history and is used extensively for both civilian and military operations.Equipped with advanced navigation, flight instruments, and radio systems, the Mi-8 can operate in both clear and challenging weather conditions, day or night.The helicopter comes in multiple configurations. The passenger version seats up to 18 people, while the transport variant features folding benches for up to 24 troops.The Mi-8MT military transport modification is designed for troop deployment and evacuation, fire support, precision bombing, and cargo transport, making it a key asset for airborne operations.As per the SSO, all helicopters were destroyed in an artillery missile strike on a concealed Russian jump pad - an improvised, camouflaged position used for rapid redeployment and surprise attacks against Ukraine’s Security and Defense Forces.“The enemy once again believed it was safe deep in the rear. We have once again proven that nothing is beyond the reach of the SSO,” the report read.This operation adds to a series of precision strikes carried out by Ukrainian forces in the Russian rear. On March 20, the HUR reported hitting multiple targets in Russian-occupied Crimea in recent days, including air defense systems, the tugboat Fedor Uryupin, and a Mi-8 helicopter.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police Officers Use Pepper Spray on a Demonstrator Wearing Dervish Clothes | Istanbul, Turkey</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jilyxo/police_officers_use_pepper_spray_on_a/</link><author>/u/arsenpontius</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 08:31:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: EU&apos;s top diplomat and Israel&apos;s foreign minister hold press conference</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jne6IsuGm0</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5Jne6IsuGm0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 08:31:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas hold a press conference in Jerusalem.

Vi må derfor se alvoren i øjnene og erkende, at hver eneste minut gælder for, at amerikanernes drøm om at annektere vores land ikke bliver til realitet, og der har vi brug for et handlekraftigt og beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, som kan træde til på vegne af befolkningen, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede (IA).Hvor bliver vores allierede af?Múte Bourup Egede mener, at de demokratiske lande og især Grønlands allierede er alt for tøvende med at erklære og udvise deres støtte til Grønland:- Indtil for nyligt kunne vi trygt stole på amerikanerne, som jo var vores allierede og venner, og som vi yndede at arbejde tæt sammen med. De har udvist respekt for os som et samfund, og vi har lavet gode samarbejdsrelationer, som gerne skulle holde i mange år. Men den tid er forbi, det må vi erkende, for den nye amerikanske ledelse er helt og aldeles ligeglad med, hvad vi hidtil har stået sammen om, for nu gælder det kun for dem at overtage vores land hen over hovedet på os, siger Múte Bourup Egede og fortsætter:- Ja, de vestlige allierede stod sammen og hjalp hinanden i tykt og tyndt, men det er endevendt nu med den siddende præsident i USA. Men at vores øvrige allierede i det internationale samfund føles at gemme sig i et lille hjørne og nærmest hvisker, at de støtter os, har ingen effekt, og hvis de ikke højlydt siger fra overfor, hvordan USA behandler Grønland, vil situationen eskalere dag for dag, og den amerikanske aggression vil tiltage. Så vi har behov for, at vores øvrige allierede klart og tydeligt kommer med deres støtte og opbakning til os, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede til Sermitsiaq.Mike Waltz-signalet er ikke til at misforståMúte Bourup Egede henviser til det forestående "private" besøg, hvor vicepræsidentens hustru, Usha Vance, med stor sandsynlighed vil have følgeskab af Donald Trumps sikkerhedsrådgiver Mike Waltz.Bourup Egede mener, at det er en meget klar provokation, og at det er en farlig en af slagsen:- Vi er nu på et niveau, hvor det på ingen måde kan karakteriseres som et harmløs besøg fra en politikerkone, der er udsigt til. For hvad skal sikkerhedsrådgiveren i Grønland? Det eneste formål er at vise magtdemonstration over for os, og signalet er ikke til at misforstå. Det er Trumps fortrolige og nærmeste rådgiver, og alene hans tilstedeværelse i Grønland vil helt sikkert få amerikanerne til at tro på Trumps mission, og presset vil tiltage efter besøget. Så kom nu med et beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, det er nu vi har brug for det, slutter formanden for Inuit Ataqatigiit, Múte Bourup Egede.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hundreds gather outside Tesla showroom in Boston to protest Elon Musk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCH6kjh2tlk</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dCH6kjh2tlk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 07:00:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Protests at Tesla dealerships across the U.S. continued over the weekend drawing hundreds of demonstrators calling for billionaire Elon Musk’s ouster from the federal government.

And so that’s what I fear — is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now,” Smith said in the telephone interview.Story continues below advertisement“‘I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials: ‘Let’s just put things on pause so we can get through an election. Let’s have the best person at the table make the argument for how they would deal with that,’ and I think that’s Pierre Poilievre.”Poilievre has been working to distance himself from the Republicans and President Trump, but an Alberta political analyst said Smith did him no favours.“We know that Danielle Smith has the potential to be a big liability for Pierre Poilievre. That’s been the case since she became premier and perhaps even before that,” said Lori Williams, a political analyst at Mount Royal University in Calgary.Story continues below advertisementAsked about Smith’s comments on Sunday, Poilievre avoided directly responding to anything she said but pointed out that Trump recently told Fox News he thought it would be easier to deal with a Liberal.The Conservatives have seen their lead in the polls evaporate in recent weeks as Trump and his trade war have become a top issue for voters, according to .The poll, published last week by Ipsos Public Affairs exclusively for Global News, found if a federal election were held now, the Liberals would secure 42 per cent of decided voter support, compared with 36 per cent for the Conservatives — widening their lead over the Tories by seven points in just three weeks.Story continues below advertisementPoilievre has shifted his overall messages as Canadian pride surged in the face of Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada.He’s putting less emphasis on the notion that “Canada is broken” and striking a more positive tone, vowing to “restore Canada’s promise” — the notion, he said, that “anyone from anywhere can achieve anything.”In the Breitbart interview, Smith also discussed how she felt former prime minister Justin Trudeau got Canada “into a ditch” after his trip to Trump’s Florida estate Mar-A-Lago following the U.S. Election in November.Smith said Trudeau made two blunders: by not ensuring Canada was meeting the two per cent military spending target for NATO, and making Canada appear fragile economically.Story continues below advertisementWilliams said the comments in the interview are another bad move by the premier.“Now that she has essentially suggested that the administration just pause the tariffs during the election — I think that in itself is problematic.“But to also say that Pierre Poilievre aligns with the values of the Trump administration — I think that becomes quite difficult for Pierre Poilievre,” Williams said, adding it it undermines his claim that Donald Trump wouldn’t want him as prime minister.Alberta Opposition leader Naheed Nenshi said Smith is putting politics ahead of Canadian unity.“Danielle Smith is more than happy to placate Trump during the worst economic crisis facing our country than she is willing to work with Canadians,” Nenshi said in a post on X Sunday afternoon.Story continues below advertisement“Calling for a pause on tariffs to politically benefit one party or another isn’t the right approach. But standing firm for Canada is.”With the federal election campaign officially beginning on Sunday, the Liberals are already using it against the federal Conservatives.“With respect to the premier’s comments: I take note of her alignment of Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump and would note that that’s one of the decisions that Canadians will have to make,” said Liberal Leader Mark Carney.In a statement to Global News on Sunday, the premier’s office said any suggestion Smith is asking the U.S. to interfere in Canada’s election is offensive and false.Story continues below advertisementSmith added she has been working with other premiers in order to convey to American officials how damaging tariffs could be – and how they need to be put on hold until after an election in order to properly renegotiate CUSMA.“Now that an election has been called I would reiterate my hope that the United States would refrain from placing tariffs on their closest ally and largest trading partner during the middle of the election,” Smith said in her statement on Sunday.Smith was scheduled to speak at the University of Alberta for an unrelated announcement on Monday. That event was postponed on Sunday afternoon.— with files from Sarah Ritchie, The Canadian Press, and Drew Stremick, Global News]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police clash with protesters in Turkey after arrest of Istanbul mayor</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTcEAg2cV7Q</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTcEAg2cV7Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 23:32:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Protesters clashed with police during a protest outside Istanbul's city hall Sunday night over the arrest of the city’s mayor, a key rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The national security adviser is supposed to be traveling earlier in the week with the U.S. energy secretary, Chris Wright.The prime minister, Mute B.

Germany has committed massive sums to European, as well as its own defense expenditure. On Friday, the upperhouse of the German parliament gave the green light to an almost unlimited increase in defense spending. In addition, lawmakers agreed to an infrastructure fund worth half a trillion euros. This decision came a day after the European Union agreed to increase defense spending by 800 billion euros.

Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Brösche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s US-Mexico border program, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he’s never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.“It’s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn’t make sense,” he said. “It doesn’t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions” they endured.“The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,” Rios said.Of course, tourists from countries where the U.S. requires visas — many of them non-Western nations — have long encountered difficulties entering the U.S.U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have recently been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren’t simply denied entry.Weekslong lockups fuel anxieties about tourist travel to U.S.The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the “evolving” federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of travel for spring break, warning “re-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.”Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Brösche, who was held for 45 days, “were deemed inadmissible” by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but “if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.” The agencies did not comment on the other cases.Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, U.S. authorities have wide discretion to still deny entry. Following the detentions, Britain and Germany updated their travel advisories to alert people about the strict U.S. border enforcement. The United Kingdom warned “you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.”Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler’s dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.“Mexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,” Tyler said.They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff’s 90-day tourist permit.When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, “Where are you going? Where do you live?” Tyler said.“English is not Lucas’ first language and so he said, ‘We’re going to Las Vegas,’ and the agent says, ’Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can’t do that,'” Tyler said.Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fiancé’s whereabouts.During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.“You are angry, you are sad, you don’t know when you can get out,” Sielaff said. “You just don’t get any answers from anybody.”He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.‘A blatant abuse’ of U.S. border authorities’ power, victims say“What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol’s power,” Tyler said.Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Brösche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.“She’s happy to be home,” Paschen said. “She seems very relieved if anything but she’s not coming back here anytime soon.”On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker traveling across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur on a U.S. work visa, was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.Before Mooney’s release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying: “It certainly reinforces anxiety that … many Canadians have about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.”The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration’s arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.“Nobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,” he said.Associated Press writer Rob Gillies reported from Toronto.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis discharged from hospital in Rome | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3_lHm-tto</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kh3_lHm-tto?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 17:08:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis has been released from Gemelli Hospital in Rome, after a five-week stay where he received treatment for a polymicrobial infection which had developed into double pneumonia.

To invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That’s why I’m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.”In addition to sparking a trade war with Washington’s northerly ally just days after taking office, Mr Trump has repeatedly insisted that Canada should become the 51st state of America, and on Friday even acknowledged that he had “totally changed” the political dynamic in Canada with his threats.Polls now suggest the Liberals, who had badly trailed the Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals – who have sought to portray Mr Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. In contrast, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections. Having served for years as his party’s go-to attack dog, the 45-year-old has carved a niche as a firebrand populist who says he will put “Canada first”, vowing to defund the country’s public broadcaster and refusing to allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.With a strong performance in predominantly French-speaking Quebec key to any victory, Mr Poilievre speaks flawless French, while Mr Carney recently stumbled at a press conference when asked to respond in French, misunderstanding the question before responding in English.Mr Poilievre’s party also raised questions about how Mr Carney transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust, and will have been encouraged last week by the prime minister’s bristly response to a reporter who asked about the trust and who Mr Carney accused of engaging in “conflict and ill will”.But while the Conservatives had sought to make the election about Mr Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged, Mr Carney is now hopeful that his combative approach to dealing with the White House will help him ride the wave of Canadian nationalism which has surged in response to Mr Trump’s annexation threats.He said on Sunday: “Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn’t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen.”Conversely, Mr Poilievre has recently been endorsed by Mr Trump’s ally Elon Musk, while his own conservative ally, Alberta premier Danielle Smith, told far-right outlet Breitbart earlier this month that Mr Poilievre would be “very much in sync” with the “new direction in America”.Launching his campaign on Sunday, Mr Poilievre said he would be respectful but firm with Mr Trump and would “insist the president recognises the independence and sovereignty of Canada”, adding: “I will insist he stops tariffing our nation.”“You are worried about your job and the sovereignty of our nation. And you are angry at the feeling of betrayal that these unacceptable words and tariffs have made us all experience. I share your anger and I share the worry about our future.”As evidenced by the focus of the two leading candidates’ remarks on Sunday, Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Canada’s Western University, said Mr Carney’s political inexperience may be of less consequence in the campaign as a result of the Trump factor.“There’s a different kind of comparison that’s being made right between the leaders and what are they going to be able to do,” said Professor Stephenson. “I have a feeling we’re going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign.”An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released on Monday put the Liberals on 42 per cent and the Conservatives on 37.

In videos published online, the vote was secured by the Russian military and under duress.Ukraine continues to control regional capitals Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, with the later being liberated in November 2022. Following the liberation of the regional capital, , while thousands of others who were forced to leave were able to return home.On the liberated territories, a number of Russian torture chambers were found.Equating Ukrainian Russian speakers to Russians who support the war and using language as a way to justify its war against Ukraine is a common theme of Russian propaganda.According to Witkoff, the problem around Russian-occupied oblasts is the Ukrainian administration's resistance to political fallout in case "the world (would) acknowledge that those are Russian territories.""Can (President Volodymyr) Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is the central issue in the conflict," Witkoff said.Witkoff also  that Ukraine will hold presidential elections. His statement came after Carlson echoed a Russian narrative, saying that Moscow considers Zelensky "not elected" and, therefore, "can't sign any kind of treaty."Witkoff alleged that Ukrainian leadership had "largely conceded that they are not going to be a member of NATO" but added the discussion is open on whether Ukraine could have a degree of NATO-member protection from the U.S. and European countries.Witkoff added that Russia "100%" doesn't want to wage a war in Europe or "absorb Ukraine" fully."(Russia) reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?" Witkoff added, not mentioning that Russia had made similar claims of not invading Ukraine prior to its full-scale invasion.Witkoff empathized that Trump is focused on reviving their relationship with Putin over the course of peace talks."Who doesn't want to have a world where Russia and the  are doing collaboratively good things together?" he said, mentioning the prospect of doing business as usual with Russia with "energy policies in the Arctic," selling natural gas to Europe and collaborating on AI."That is a complicated situation, including war and all the ingredients that led up to it. It's never just one person," Witkoff added.With regards to a partial ceasefire that would halt strikes against  and moratorium on maritime hits in the , Witkoff claimed that they are "going to be implemented in the next week or so."Witkoff also said that Putin claimed to have prayed for "his friend" Trump in a local church after an attempt on Trump's life in July 2024 and gave Witkoff a commissioned portrait of Trump as a gift for the U.S. president."This is the kind of connection that we've been able to reestablish (with Russia) through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy," Witkoff added."This might be the stupidest thing I've ever seen," right-wing commentator Richard Hanania  on X (Twitter) along with this segment of the interview.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Musk suspends accounts of Türkiye opposition candidates in X</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/musks-x-suspends-opposition-accounts-turkey-protest-civil-unrest-erdogan-imamoglu-istanbul-mayor/</link><author>/u/Ventriloquist_Voice</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:05:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk’s X has challenged a German court decision that instructed the platform to share data with researchers, the court confirmed to POLITICO.

Now, the U.S. says Canadians must build their own.</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haskell-free-library-and-opera-house-canada-u-s-cross-border-separate-entrances/</link><author>/u/CupidStunt13</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:50:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, a century-old tradition that allowed Canadians and Americans to freely access the front entrance of the Haskell Free Library and Opera House that straddles Vermont and Quebec will come to an end. Canadian members used to walk down the approximately 70 feet of American sidewalk with their identifying documents, such as a passport or license, and enter through the library's main entrance, which sits on the Vermont side. But last week, U.S. authorities said that this easy access will end, with most Canadians needing to enter through a separate entrance on Canada's side. "It's been in effect for 104 years, and suddenly, with this new administration, it's not," said Sonia De Paoli, 71, a Canadian who moved to the area from Montreal after she retired. De Paoli joined the library's board of trustees —  consisting of four Americans and three Canadians — a few years ago to help this "unique" private organization. Beginning Monday, Canadians with proof of library membership will still be able to use the front entrance on the Vermont side, but nonmembers will need to enter through the Canadian side, the library said. But by Oct. 1, all Canadians, including members, will be required to use the entrance on Canada's side — although once inside the library Canadians and Americans can still freely intermingle. The private library was founded in 1901 between Stanstead, Quebec, and Derby Line, Vermont, to encourage cooperation between the border towns. The historic building, which also houses a 400-seat opera house, has thick tape running throughout its interior, denoting where the U.S. border ends and the Canadian one begins.De Paoli said the U.S. government's unilateral decision to shut Canadians' access to the front door has left the community not feeling very good. She said some members were writing to the library and saying, "Why do we have to use the back door? We've been doing this forever, why do we have to do this?"A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Reuters that the U.S. decision was in response . "Drug traffickers and smugglers were exploiting the fact that Canadians could use the U.S. entrance without going through customs. We are ending such exploitation by criminals and protecting Americans," the statement said. CBS News has reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for further information on numbers relating to drug trafficking and smuggling near the library. A CBP spokesperson confirmed to the Associated Press that it had implemented the move to restrict Canadians from the Vermont entrance.   De Paoli said in the years since she'd lived in the Stanstead area, the "world had changed" very much, but library trustees and staff had regular meetings with CBP and Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police to ensure knowledge of any new border directives. There haven't been any custom or trafficking incidents involving library visitors of which the trustees have been aware, De Paoli said. And she noted they were even able to keep access to the front entrance open for both nations during World War I and World War II. "We do love our neighbors," said De Paoli, adding that American library members are just as upset and frustrated by the news as their Canadian counterparts.The library now needs to build out the new Canadian entrance to code — a blow to a not-for-profit organization that has existed on a limited endowment since 1908. Membership is free, says De Paoli, as are many of the other events it hosts for the rural communities surrounding the historic building. Other times, they will charge a few dollars to attend the opera or a local film festival. "For our film festivals, tickets are $5. We charge $1 for popcorn," De Paoli said, adding the surrounding communities are mostly rural farming areas. To build out the Canadian entrance, the Haskell has to create a parking lot with reduced mobility spots, install reduced mobility access ramps and entrances, and build another proper building entrance to the facility.The library will comply with the new directive, but said in a statement, "We refuse to let a border divide what history has built together."Costs are expected to top 100,000 Canadian dollars, De Paoli said. So far, they've raised more than half the funds through a GoFundMe page, and De Paoli said she has "been in tears seeing donations from the communities of $5, $10, $50 from people who don't have much money but are doing it because they care."Cara TabachnickCara Tabachnick is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

European officials previously clashed with Musk over concerns that  could be cut off in Ukraine.Earlier this year, the Italian government explored the possibility of an agreement with Starlink, but opposition officials denounced the idea of a contract with Musk, citing his comments on Ukraine. "It seems to me that everything has stopped ... the topic has moved from Starlink to the statements of and about the person," Crosetto .Negotiations are on hold for now, he said, and  will focus on what is "useful and safe" for the country in its defense contracts.Authorities in Italy are currently not working on a contract with  but will consider it in the future, Crosetto said. "The technical plan is not being discussed. When the controversy and the times have calmed down, there will be a technical approach."  officials voiced concern Starlink could cut off Ukraine's access to its internet service, following media reports that the U.S. had threatened to terminate Starlink service in order to pressure Kyiv to sign a minerals deal with Washington. Starlink internet access is crucial to Ukraine's battlefield communications. Musk and top White House officials clashed with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski over the legitimacy of such  on March 9.Musk denied Starlink access could be cut off in Ukraine following backlash from Ukraine's allies."To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will  its terminals," Musk said on March 9.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump makes NCAA men&apos;s wrestling championships his latest sports-focused trip</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXQfcDwcMiM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kXQfcDwcMiM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 13:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trump arrived at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Saturday night to loud cheers and U.S.A chants.

He added that the best response is not to get provoked. "On the day in which the Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky didn’t go particularly well, we were under pressure to come out very critically with, you know, flowery adjectives to describe how others felt," Starmer told the New York Times. Starmer instead called both sides to "try and get them back on the same page." He added that he has a good relationship with Trump and understands "what he’s trying to achieve."Oval Office clash on Feb. 28, Starmer sent his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, to Kyiv to advise Zelensky on how to repair relations with Trump. The British leader later updated Trump on Kyiv’s progress, helping set up a call between the two presidents that saw Zelensky openly back Trump’s peace efforts. Nonetheless, Ukrainian officials still remain skeptical of Washington’s attempts to cultivate a ceasefire. A U.S.-orchestrated 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure was agreed by Moscow and Kyiv on March 18, but Russia has continued to launch hundreds of drones at Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians. The spat between Zelensky and Trump on Feb. 28, caused outrage in Ukraine that only escalated when Washington temporarily cut off military intelligence aid on March 5. At the same time, Trump has done little to pressure Russia, apart from threats of sanctions. U.S. negotiators are set to separately meet Ukrainian and Russian delegates in Riyadh on March 24 to discuss the partial ceasefire proposal. Until now, the Trump team has only held bilateral talks with each side separately, including meetings with Russia in Riyadh on Feb. 18 and Istanbul on Feb. 27, and with Ukraine in Jeddah on March 11.Starmer, an ardent supporter of Ukraine, has called for countries to join a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine with a peacekeeping force. He warned that Putin will breach any peace deal unless security guarantees are in place. "It needs to be clear to Putin that there will be severe consequences if he breaches the lines," he said on March 20.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bandwagon Woes: DEI, EVs and Wall Street South</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdWnBog2Z0o</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OdWnBog2Z0o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 12:05:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when bandwagon movements are not as enduring as they were introduced to be?

As part of this, the Government aims to strengthen ties, secure a broad-based security pact and tackle barriers to trade with the EU.The President of the European Commission and the Prime Minister have met several times and have agreed to strengthen the relationship between the EU and UK. This is not about renegotiating or relitigating Brexit, but about looking forward and realising the potential of the UK-EU relationship.In particular, we want to work closely to address wider global challenges including economic headwinds, geopolitical competition, irregular migration, climate change and energy prices, which pose fundamental challenges to the shared values of the United Kingdom and the European Union and provide the strategic driver for stronger cooperation.There will be issues which are difficult to resolve, as well as areas on which we will stand firm. We have been clear we are not going back to the arguments of the past; we are not rejoining the single market or customs union and we will not return to freedom of movement. But we are committed to finding constructive ways to work together and deliver for the British people. This means we will respect international law and shared institutions. We are committed to implementing the Windsor Framework in good faith and protecting the UK internal market. And we are committed to staying in the ECHR.We will now work with the EU to identify areas where we can strengthen cooperation for mutual benefit, such as the economy, energy, security and resilience. We have been clear that the trading relationship can be improved. We have already said we will seek to negotiate a veterinary/SPS agreement to prevent unnecessary border checks and help tackle the cost of food and will work to help our touring artists and aim to secure mutual recognition for professional qualifications to help open up new markets for UK service exporters.We are working with the higher education sector to ensure our world leading universities continue to attract the brightest and best and support our economy. Having associated to Horizon Europe, the UK wants its scientists, researchers and businesses to continue to work together with partners in Europe and elsewhere.This is about turning the page – reinvigorating alliances and forging new partnerships with our European friends, rather than reopening the divisions of the past. We will work to improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade. And we will strengthen co-operation to keep our people safe.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visits the frontline in Kharkiv</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxzkZ1WbaIE</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CxzkZ1WbaIE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:11:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy paid a visit on Saturday to a series of defensive installations along the frontline around the Kharkiv region.

Ekrem Imamoglu will remain in custody pending trial on corruption charges. 
Imamoglu was detained earlier this week in a raid on his residence, triggering the largest anti-government demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade. Opponents of President Erdogan accuse him of trying to remove a major contender in the 2028 presidential election. Government officials reject the accusations. In a separate ruling, the court temporarily released him from terrorism charges pending a further investigation. DW's Dorian Jones reports from Istanbul.

At least two people were killed - one of them shot directly in the head. The Centre for Democracy and Development, a civil society organization, said the police's Rapid Intervention Unit fired live rounds at their team while they were observing the events. Opposition leader Venancio Mondlane had called for the day of protest on the 18th of March - to honor national heroes killed in earlier demonstrations, such as activist Azagaia, a rapper who sang about injustice in the country.
Demonstrators say President Daniel Chapo stole last year’s election, and though his government was sworn in in January, many business owners in the country still find themselves in limbo. 
Entrepreneurs are struggling to get back on their feet: Mozambique’s chamber of commerce estimates that at least 1,000 businesses are closed due to vandalism, looting, and disorder in the wake of the unrest, and says most of them will never recover.

Seeking to rebalance US-China trade and bring manufacturing jobs home, Trump imposed tariffs on China during his first term that were kept in place by the Biden administration. Chinese manufacturers priced out of the US had to search for alternative markets, while some moved production to other countries to evade duties.

Boosting exports became even more urgent when President Xi Jinping took steps around 2020 to deflate a property bubble. He then ramped up investment in manufacturing to bolster the economy, propelling China’s trade surplus to an all-time high of just under $1 trillion in 2024. While Xi’s government has signaled its intention to shift the economy more toward consumption, robust exports will still be needed this year to hit an ambitious growth target of about 5%.

The pain in countries such Indonesia is being felt in other emerging economies, and it’s only set to get worse: Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on China even higher, after hiking them by 20% since taking office in January. This means the country’s exporters, by far the most competitive in the world, are looking to replace any lost orders—a dynamic that risks unleashing an even larger flood of Chinese goods around the globe. 

Daniel Kurtz-Phelan, Editor of Foreign Affairs, offers his take on the US-China dynamic and whether the concept of globalism is a thing of the past. Dan speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

They're demonstrating against the detention of a prominent opposition politician. Ekrem İmamoğlu has been in custody over corruption and terrorism related allegations since Wednesday.  
Today he was taken to court under police escort to answer questions by prosecutors.  He denies the allegations against him. İmamoğlu supporters have been gathering in Istanbul and other cities for four nights in a row, defying a government-imposed ban on protests. Demonstrators accuse President Recep Tayipp Erdogan's government of trying to sideline his chief political rival in the run-up to presidential elections.

The new order affects over half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, who have a temporary legal status through a humanitarian parole program. It was granted under a scheme by Donald Trump's predecessor Joe Biden, and allowed migrants from certain countries to stay in the US for up to two years. Trump suspended the program when he took office.
