Former Governor Andrew Cuomo blasted his rival Zohran Mamdani’s candidacy in the race for mayor of New York City as “abhorrent” and the competition as a “battle for the soul” of the Democratic party.
“This is a civil war within the Democratic party where the extreme left is pulling the Democratic party and the moderates are afraid,” Cuomo said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “The Democratic Party is not anti-business, it’s not anti-police. That’s not who we are.”
Cuomo, 67, is running as an independent and is polling in second place behind Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, in a four-way race that also includes Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams.
Cuomo, who as governor led New York through the Covid-19 pandemic, slammed the 33-year-old Mamdani, a Queens assemblyman, as inexperienced.
“He’s going to run 300,000 employees, $115 billion budget. You wake up any morning, you could have a terrorist attack, you could have another COVID,” Cuomo said. “It just demeans government and demeans public service in a way that I just find abhorrent and I’m going to do everything I can to stop it.”
A Suffolk University CityView poll released Tuesday showed Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, leading Cuomo by 20 percentage points. The former governor lost to Mamdani by more than 12 points in the primary election.

Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, endorsed Cuomo in the primary and has contributed to a PAC supporting his candidacy.

His assertion that Ukraine could reclaim occupied territories has raised eyebrows around the world - and hopes - in Kyiv. So, is Trump really distancing himself further from Moscow? Or is this just another chapter in his unpredictable policy book? Trump is making it clear - not just at the UN, but across the board that it’s only his worldview that matters. At home, he continues to reshape the United States to his own vision. After the murder of far-right activist Charlie Kirk, the President is cracking down harder on his critics. The press - both domestic and international—is facing massive hostility. Critics warn that the U.S. may have already crossed the threshold into authoritarianism. So, today, on To The Point, we ask: Trump the Unpredictable: What’s His Real Plan for Ukraine and for Democracy?

Chris Wright, the former CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy, believes climate change is real but says there are worse problems plaguing the world. Wright is playing a leading role in Trump's efforts to boost fossil fuels and nuclear power while slashing grants and incentives for wind and solar.

Reuters Senior Energy & Environment Correspondent Timothy Gardner talks with Wright about his department's recent climate report, Trump's efforts to boost oil, gas, and coal, and how the US plans to deal with rising electricity demand – and energy bills - driven by power-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence.

"So by highlighting this it secures more funding to try to do more about it."The German defence minister used Thursday's conference to unveil a €35bn (£30bn) investment in the country's space programmes over the next five years.Mr Pistorius said it was important to hold talks on developing offensive capabilities in space as a deterrent to hostile actions.As he was speaking, he told delegates: "Thirty-nine Chinese and Russian reconnaissance satellites are flying over us... so be careful what you say".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No conclusive evidence linking acetaminophen to autism, says Health Canada in rebuke to Trump</title><link>https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/no-evidence-linking-acetaminophen-to-autism-says-health-canada-in-rebuke-to-trump/</link><author>/u/-Mystica-</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 12:22:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Updated: September 24, 2025 at 11:16AM EDTPublished: September 24, 2025 at 9:49AM EDT]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Satellites launched for Amazon&apos;s Project Kuiper</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59kQ0k5gIFI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/59kQ0k5gIFI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 12:19:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[United Launch Alliance launches a batch of satellites from Cape Canaveral, Florida, for Amazon's Project Kuiper.

General Assembly, and is due to hold talks later today with Donald Trump at the White House. The two leaders are seen as having a good rapport -- which Erdogan is hoping will help land him a key weapons deal. But Erdogan is less likely to move Trump on another issue dear to him -- pressuring Israel to end its war in Gaza.  Our Istanbul correspondent Julia Hahn takes a closer look at the two leaders' relationship.

            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s flight to the US took a circuitous route in an apparent effort to avoid countries that could enforce an outstanding arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes.
    
            Netanyahu left Tel Aviv on Wednesday evening to speak at the UN General Assembly and to meet with President Donald Trump.
    
            But his flight, which would normally overfly several European countries, instead flew the  length of the Mediterranean Sea and over the Strait of Gibraltar, according to flight tracking websites.
    
            The flight briefly overflew Greece and Italy, according to FlightRadar24, but it entirely avoided French and Spanish airspace, lengthening the duration of the flight.
    
            The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has not publicly said why they took the unusual route and CNN has approached them for comment.
    
            The PMO announced two weeks ago that some journalists and members of Netanyahu’s entourage would not accompany him for “technical arrangements related to seating and security.” The Jerusalem Post reported that it was a way of compensating for the additional fuel required.
    
            A French diplomatic source said France had accepted an Israeli request to fly over French airspace.
    
            “Eventually they decided to take another route and we don’t know the reason,” said the diplomat.
    
            Netanyahu’s last trip to the United States in July flew over Greece, Italy, and France, according to ADS-B Exchange, another flight tracking website.
    
            The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last November for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. If Netanyahu were to overfly European countries who are members of the ICC, he could be forced to land and arrested.
    
            Neither Israel nor the United States are members of the ICC.

In Delhi, cases spiked by 277% in just two years. A young girl reportedly died in a dog attack - prompting the Supreme Court this August to order all stray dogs in Delhi to be permanently put into shelters. This order was swiftly reversed, but the issue is now a highly divisive one. India’s stray dog crisis remains caught between fear and compassion, law and implementation. DW’s Manira Chaudhary reports.

"My goal is to finish the war," Zelensky told Axios in a new interview, saying Ukraine would hold presidential elections when the Russian invasion ends. Only part of Zelensky's interview was published. The rest is due for release on Friday, Axios said.has contacted the Kremlin for comment.Due to martial law invoked because of the Russian invasion, Ukraine cannot hold elections, a fact that Zelensky's opponents have used to criticize his leadership and question his mandate—including Moscow. But Zelensky’s comments suggest that despite the difficult security situation and Ukraine's constitution, a ballot was still possible, signaling he was open to a political shift in Kyiv to give a leader a new mandate to run the country after the war. Zelensky was elected in a landslide in 2019 and if it had not been for Russia’s invasion his five-year term would have ended in May 2024. Zelensky’s popularity has fluctuated from the highs of over 90 percent at the start of the war to still well above 60 percent.   Despite his popularity as a wartime leader, Zelensky faced the first major protests of the conflict in July after his allies in Parliament tried to weaken the country’s independent anti-corruption agencies, before the move was reversed.  Rumors of an election go back months, with David Arakhamia, head of Ukraine’s Servant of the People party, denying reports of a meeting in the President’s Office about preparations for a ballot. However, Zelensky’s comments to Axios suggest that a ballot could be on the horizon. "During the ceasefire, I think security can give the possibility to have elections," he told the outlet. If Zelensky endorsed a bill for elections, this would likely pass given his party’s large majority in Parliament.    Zelensky also told  that if Russia did not end the war, Russian officials should ensure they know where the nearest bomb shelter is.  The Ukrainian president reportedly said he had Donald Trump’s backing to hit Russian targets including energy infrastructure and drone factories in tit-for-tat strikes. He also said he told Trump of his desire for an additional weapon system to speed up the end of the war. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, to Axios: "we can use this period of time, and I can give this signal to the Parliament" for elections and that Ukrainians may want "a leader with ... a new mandate." He added: "During the ceasefire, I think security can give the possibility to have elections." Zelensky gave no time frame for an election but his suggestion that it might happen during a ceasefire means that are many obstacles ahead. A peace settlement that would end Russia's war is stuck on two major points: territorial concessions and the future architecture of Ukraine's security. Russia demands that Ukraine recognize its control of the territory seized during its invasion. It also says it will not agree to anything that deepens NATO's involvement in Ukraine, such as peacekeeping troops from allies such as France and the U.K.Update 09/25/25, 09:09 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further information. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brazil storms shut two Toyota plants</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A8bWPBdiNDM</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/A8bWPBdiNDM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 10:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Japanese carmaker Toyota was forced to halt production at two plants in Brazil on September 23 after heavy rain and winds severely damaged its Porto Feliz factory, the company said.

US EV pioneer Tesla continued its downward spiral. European sales of the brand led by Elon Musk dropped 22% in August, giving it a market share of just 1.9%. Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz all gained, while BYD outshone them all as it more than tripled deliveries, though sales still remain relatively low. In geopolitics, Denmark endured the second drone attack this week as authorities probe potential Russian involvement in the incidents and discuss how to involve NATO allies. Large professional drones spotted at five regional airports in Denmark disrupted flights and sparked a major police operation overnight. The airports are open now.

They also said they believe the drones are being operated by a -quote- 'professional actor', but that there was no evidence of a link to Russia. The defense minister called it the “most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date” and has reached out to NATO and the EU to discuss the incidents. 
Danish police said it was not possible to down the drones that were spotted at three airports and a military base, and that no one had been arrested. The incidents come a day after Copenhagen airport was shut due to drones, and follow a series of incursions of Russian drones and aircraft into EU airspace this month.

Apple added that Brussels was creating unfair competition as the rules were not applied to Samsung, the largest smartphone provider in the EU.Among the requirements of the DMA is that Apple ensures that headphones made by other brands will work with iPhones. It said this has been a block on it releasing its live translation service in the EU as it allows rival companies to access data from conversations, creating a privacy problem.Apple said the DMA should be repealed or, at a minimum, replaced with more appropriate legislation. It did not specify which products could in future be prevented from being distributed in the EU, but said that the Apple Watch, first released a decade ago, might not be released today in the EU.It is the latest clash between the California-based company and the European Commission. Earlier this year, Apple launched an appeal against a €500m fine imposed by the EU for allegedly preventing app developers from steering users to cheaper deals outside the app store.He said in a post on Truth Social: “I will stand up to Countries that attack our incredible American Tech Companies. Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology.“They also, outrageously, give a complete pass to China’s largest Tech Companies. This must end, and end NOW!”Apple said that under the DMA, “instead of competing by innovating, already successful companies are twisting the law to suit their own agendas – to collect more data from EU citizens, or to get Apple’s technology for free”.It said that rules under the act affected the way it provided users access to apps. “Pornography apps are available on iPhone from other marketplaces – apps we’ve never allowed on the App Store because of the risks they create, especially for children,” it said.The European Commission was approached for comment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the war changed media consumption and Ukraine&apos;s media landscape | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTAlcIG5aEQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NTAlcIG5aEQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 09:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While President Trump's support for regaining territory was a welcome boost for many people in Ukraine, few believe peace is around the corner.

The main literature prize, endowed with 10,000 euros, even bore his name, the Klaus-Michael Kuehne Prize. That was until 2022, when two nominees for the prize withdrew because of Kuehne’s refusal to deal with his firm and family’s Nazi past, and the prize was renamed. Kuehne’s foundation felt it was “treated extremely unfairly in the matter,” a spokesperson told the German newspaper  at the time. It soon stopped sponsoring the festival. It didn’t take place this year because the festival wasn’t able to find a major sponsor to replace the foundation.Author Sven Pfizenmaier was the first of the two nominees to withdraw from the prize. “I’m no fan of billionaires in general and billionaires who profited from Nazism, deny it, and whitewash themselves by funding art seems very bad, so that’s why I did it,” Pfizenmaier says by phone from Berlin.“We believe that being open, honest, and transparent in everything we do will build trust with our stakeholders,” reads the opening sentence on Kuehne + Nagel’s investor relations page. When it comes to the company’s dark history, Kuehne is anything but open and transparent. In April 2015 a regional TV channel in Germany broadcast a short documentary about Kuehne + Nagel’s role in the furniture operation. Shortly before the film aired, Kuehne wrote to the channel director, asking that the outlet reconsider broadcasting the 22-minute documentary, because “old wounds are being reopened.”Kuehne’s brazen request, which was declined, came only months after he had shelved the Handelsblatt Research Institute study sources say he had commissioned for Kuehne + Nagel’s 125th anniversary.In the run-up to the broadcast, the transportation firm published a defensive statement on its website. “Like other companies that already existed before 1945, Kuehne + Nagel was involved in the war economy and had to maintain its existence in dark and difficult times,” wrote the company in the German-only statement. “Kuehne + Nagel is aware of the shameful events during the Third Reich and deeply regrets that it carried out some of its activities on behalf of the Nazi regime. The conditions under the dictatorship at the time and the fact that Kuehne + Nagel survived the turmoil of war with all its strength and secured the company’s existence must be taken into account.” It remains the sole acknowledgment to date by the firm about its Nazi activities. Other than the statement, Kuehne + Nagel’s website doesn’t mention the past, as it doesn’t have a history section.While the firm has stayed silent on its past since 2015, Kuehne has since responded to the criticism that he and his company have not sufficiently addressed the company’s past involvement in Nazi crimes. “I would have understood if people had questioned these things 10 or 20 years after the war. Everything was still fresh in people’s minds then. The people who were responsible at the time were still alive. But to come back to it 70 years later. I find that strange,” Kuehne said in the  interview from January 2022. “At some point, one has to let the dust settle on things. That’s my basic attitude. It’s important to learn lessons from what happened back then.”V. THE TRUTH NEEDS TO BE TOLDO Sunday morning in early September 2023, about 300 people gathered on the waterfront in Bremen’s historical city center. The crowd was there for the inauguration of a monument commemorating the systematic looting of European Jews by Nazi Germany through the practice of Aryanization. The memorial’s chosen location was no accident. High above the waterfront, overlooking the monument, towered the German headquarters of Kuehne + Nagel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Italy sends second navy ship to escort Gaza aid flotilla</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-sends-second-navy-ship-escort-gaza-aid-flotilla-2025-09-25/?utm_source=reddit.com</link><author>/u/Massimo25ore</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 08:33:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Netanyahu leaves for New York to address the UN General Assembly</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdFhwpjlVAI</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FdFhwpjlVAI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 08:32:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left for New York early Thursday morning for a trip that will see him address the UN General Assembly.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, US futures edge higher after Wall Street takes a breather from the AI-driven rally. The Fed's Mary Daly says more cuts are coming, but the central bank should move cautiously.  

Bloomberg's learned that Intel has approached Apple about a potential investment in the struggling chipmaker, part of its comeback push after the US government took a stake. 

The US has formally cut tariffs on EU cars to 15%, with the lower rate backdated to the 1st of August, when the agreement was reached. Meanwhile, America sets the stage for levies on robotics. 

HSBC says it's achieved a world-first breakthrough in deploying quantum computing in financial markets. The bank used IBM's quantum processor to attain a 34% improvement in predicting bond trade prices. 

Today's guests: ICG CEO, Benoit Durteste

Ragasa was by far the strongest of 18 typhoons so far this year. Chinese emergency personnel are still in the throws of evacuation efforts, while trying to clear some 50,000 downed trees in the southern city of Yangjian alone. Sustained winds have dropped to from 265 kilometers per hour to about 60. In Taiwan, a barrier lake burst, flooding a residential area and killing 14 people. Cleanup of wreckage and mud there continues. Vietnam is now bracing for the arrival of the downgraded storm.

The recognition is part of a "co-ordinated international effort" toward a two-state solution, according to the Canadian and Australian governments.

Weather authorites say its the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the region this year. It made landfall in the densely populated southern province of Guangdong, where more than 2 million people have been relocated. It's now downgraded from a super typhoon, but earlier it caused floodwaters that surged through this hotel lobby in Hong Kong. On its path across the region, Ragasa has already caused massive damage in other areas, especially Taiwan. Authorities on the self-governed island say at least 14 people were killed when a lake created by an earlier landslide burst. Dozens of residents remain unaccounted for.

Pope Leo, who is forthright about his views on the new technology, also said that he had been asked for his authorisation to create an AI Pope."Someone recently asked authorization to create an artificial me so that anybody could sign onto this website and have a personal audience with 'the Pope'," said the pontiff. "This artificial intelligence Pope would give them answers to their questions, and I said, 'I'm not going to authorize that'."Pope Leo has previously said that he chose the name Leo partially as a tribute to Pope Leo III, the 19th century Pope best-known for Rerum novarum, a treatise on the exploitation of the working class during the Industrial Revolution. In one of his first addresses to cardinals, Pope Leo said AI is "another Industrial Revolution."In this latest interview, the Pope returns to the theme of human rights and dignity. "If we automate the whole world and only a few people have the means with which to more than just survive, but to live well, have meaningful lives, there's a big problem, a huge problem coming down the line," said Pope Leo.The Holy Father worries about “extremely rich people who are investing in artificial intelligence” but “totally ignoring the value of human beings and of humanity." He adds: "If the Church doesn't speak up, or if someone doesn't speak up about that—but the Church certainly needs to be one of the voices here—the danger is that the digital world will go on its own way and we will become pawns, or left by the wayside."The Pope says he's not against progress or new technology, but basically doesn't like the way things are going: "I think to lose that relationship will leave science as an empty, cold shell that will do great damage to what humanity is about. And the human heart will be lost in the midst of the technological development, as things are going right now."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: World leaders gather at UN General Assembly | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOulWyAP11k</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HOulWyAP11k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 01:20:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World leaders gather at the United Nations for the start of the 80th General Assembly high-level debate.

The Inspector General says that there has been a 15% rise in applications year on year. Young Germans can serve on a voluntary basis between 7 and 23 months. 

Germany abolished mandatory military service in 2011. But since Russia's invasion of Ukraine calls have grown louder to reintroduce it. The majority in Germany supports reintroducing mandatory military service. But a recent poll on whether Germans would be willing to take up arms in the event of a military attack painted a very different picture. Just 16% said they would 'definitely' defend the country. A further 22% said 'probably'. But a majority of 59% said they would ‘probably not or definitely not’ defend Germany if attacked.

But it is a step forward."When asked about Mr Trump's attack on climate action during his address to the UN on Wednesday, the prime minister refused to "give a running commentary" on the US leader.Australia's national targets are higher than a number of comparable countries like Japan, Canada and New Zealand.Members of the European Union failed to formally set a target for 2035 before the deadline last week, but EU President Ursula von der Leyen told the UN conference that the group's nationally determined contribution "would range between 66 per cent and 72 per cent"."We will formally submit our NDC ahead of [the climate change conference in Brazil next month]," Ms von der Leyen said."But in parallel, we are also looking ahead. We're working on a 2040 target of a proposed 90 per cent emission reduction. That is our way to climate neutrality by 2050."Mr Albanese told the conference that, 10 years after the Paris climate change agreement was struck, it is now "the decisive decade for acting on the environmental challenge of climate change but also seizing the economic opportunities of clean energy"."We all grasped the scale and the urgency of our task. We all understand the consequences of inaction for our environment."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;In Whose Name?&apos; director Nico Ballesteros on filming Ye for six years | AP interview</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTy7VxHq8cg</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YTy7VxHq8cg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:45:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After filming the artist now known as Ye for six years, Nico Ballesteros says his intimate fly-on-the-wall documentary "In Whose Name?" is about "confronting idolatry."

That's after Disney, the parent company of Kimmel's long-time network ABC, suspended the late night show following his comments on the reactions to the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.

ABC was threatened by regulators and the Trump administration, after Kimmel said the president's supporters were trying to score political points from Kirk's assassination. Disney brought Kimmel back on Tuesday, following public outrage about his suspension and a call to boycott Disney. When he took the stage last night, Kimmel didn't shy away from criticising his biggest critic, calling the president's attempt to coerce the affiliates who run his show illegal and un-American.

For many generations to come. Therefore, we have no alternative,” he said in a radio interview with Russia’s RBC radio station.Tuesday had seen Trump throw his weight behind Ukraine after a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, posting on social media that the country was “in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form”.Signalling his rapprochement with Russia was over, the US president said: “Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years, a war that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win”.Russia’s war was making it look like a “paper tiger” with a failing economy, he said.On Wednesday, Peskov pushed back against Trump’s “paper tiger” remark, insisting Russia was more of a “bear”. Though he conceded the economy, which is slowing after three years of rapid growth and with stubborn inflation, was facing some headwinds.He said it was wrong to think that Ukraine could recapture land taken by Moscow’s army. “The idea that Ukraine can recapture something is, from our point of view, mistaken,” he said.The Kremlin spokesman also poured scorn on Trump’s attempted rapprochement, which saw him welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska last month, saying it had yielded “close to zero” results.In a separate development on Wednesday, Russia’s finance ministry proposed raising the rate of value-added tax from 20 to 22 percent to finance “defence and security”, as analysts predicted the country’s rate of economic growth would plummet to around 1 percent, from 4.3 percent last year.After the Alaska summit and meetings with Zelenskyy and prominent European leaders at the White House, Trump announced he was arranging for direct talks between leaders.But Putin has not shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy, and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine, often targeting civilians in residential areas while committing a series of provocative violations of Eastern European airspace.Last week, Estonia said three Russian fighter jets violated its airspace, not long after 20 Russian drones entered Poland’s airspace, raising fears among Europe’s NATO countries of a spillover from the Ukraine war.On Tuesday, NATO had warned Russia about its actions, reminding the country of its “ironclad” adherence to Article 5 of the alliance’s founding treaty, which “commits all member states to mutual defence in the event of an attack on any one of them”.On Wednesday, Spain’s Defence Ministry said a military jet with Defence Minister Margarita Robles on board suffered a GPS “disturbance” that morning while flying near Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave on its way to Lithuania.No further details were reported.The incident follows a similar case at the end of last month, which saw the GPS system of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen jammed while en route to Bulgaria.A European Union spokesperson said at the time that Bulgarian authorities suspected the incident was due to interference by Russia.Ukraine targets oil and gas infrastructureOn Wednesday, Ukraine carried out an overnight drone strike on the Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat petrochemical plant in central Russia’s Bashkortostan region, according to the regional governor.The strike, which sparked a fire, was the second such attack on a major industrial facility in the Russian region in a week. Last week, Ukraine attacked the same complex, controlled by energy giant Gazprom.Kyiv has intensified drone attacks on Russia’s vast oil and gas infrastructure in the past weeks, targeting refineries and export-bound pipelines, as peace talks with Moscow falter.A Ukrainian drone attack in the southern Russian city of Novorossiisk killed two people, according to Veniamin Kondratyevm, the regional governor of Krasnodarskiy Krai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revolutionary HIV prevention drug to be sold far cheaper to benefit poorer countries | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De2uFSAiGfg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/De2uFSAiGfg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 23:05:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A revolutionary HIV prevention drug should be available to patients in low and middle income countries by 2027 at an affordable price. 

The drug, whose technical name is Lenacapavir, reduces the risk of infection by more than 99.9% and it is the first long acting treatment that can prevent a person catching HIV.  Developer Gilead Sciences normally charges more than 28,000 dollars for a year's supply.  Now charities including the Gates Foundation say they will help two Indian drugmakers develop generic versions of the medicine. And a year's dose will cost USD 40 per patient.

Another major concern, he noted, is the impact of artificial intelligence and chatbots on children.“We don’t know what the consequences of this use will be, but we are sure that things are not going well,” he said. “We as leaders need to do something about this. First, help the parents. It is not only their responsibility.”The prime minister pointed to steps already taken in Greece, including the ban on smartphones in schools, which he described as a “massive change” in the classroom environment. He also highlighted the launch of the Parental Control tool on the gov.gr platform, which links children’s data with social media platforms to verify their eligibility for online access.“This is the first step. Parents must create an account on this page in order to protect their children,” Mitsotakis explained, adding that they must also be attentive.He concluded by stressing the shared responsibility between governments, families, and technology companies: “We have a responsibility to not only engage with tech companies, but also with the parents. Tech companies already have enough money. They don’t need to make more money by exploiting our children.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dengue fever surges in Sudan as war batters health systems | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e29C5BA_LP8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/e29C5BA_LP8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of Sudanese people have fallen victim to dengue fever and other diseases, Sudan's health minister said, as seasonal rains further test infrastructure and hospitals devastated by the ongoing conflict.

General Assembly on Sept. 24, President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Western allies to step up support for Moldova amid growing Russian interference in its domestic politics.Moldova is preparing for parliamentary elections, where pro-Russian parties are expected to challenge the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS).Zelensky compared Moldova to countries like Georgia and Belarus, which he said fell under Russian influence due to a lack of sustained international attention.Under the leadership of the ruling Georgian Dream party, founded by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, Tbilisi has moved closer to Russia and stalled its accession to the EU.Meanwhile, Belarus has been ruled by pro-Kremlin leader Alexander Lukashenko for more than three decades."Georgia is dependent on Russia, and for many, many years, Belarus has been moving toward dependence on Russia," Zelensky said. "Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too."Zelensky added that supporting Moldova would require minimal investment from the European Union but warned that the cost of inaction could be far greater."Moldova is defending itself against Russian interference," Zelensky said. "The EU needs to help Moldova now with funding and energy support, not only with words or political gestures."According to Zelensky, bolstering support for Moldova is a crucial step toward safeguarding Europe’s overall stability.Recent years saw Moldova's pro-EU leadership increasingly warn against Russia's attempts to destabilize the country's political situation and its path toward European integration.As parliamentary elections approach, Moldova’s pro-European President Maia Sandu warned on Sept. 22 that Russia’s attempts to interfere threaten the country’s sovereignty, independence, and European future.Parliamentary elections in Moldova will take place on Sept. 28.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denmark apologizes for forced contraception of Greenland&apos;s Indigenous Inuit women | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F8DMjxIuls</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5F8DMjxIuls?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 20:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen has given an emotional speech apologizing for Denmark's mistreatment of indigenous women and girls in the past.

Frederiksen traveled to Greenland's capital, Nuuk, to ask forgiveness of the victims of the historical abuse and their families. In the 1960s and '70s, the Copenhagen government, which ruled the island as a Danish province, forced thousands of young women in Greenland, many of them minors, to have contraceptive devices inserted into their wombs as a form of compulsory birth control – often causing permanent damage.

The port of Novorossiysk near the Crimean peninsula hosts Russia's Black Sea fleet, which has played a central role in the war against Ukraine. The regional governor says the drones struck in daylight, hitting apartment buildings and a hotel. Russia has moved much of the fleet to Novorossiysk to avoid Ukrainian strikes on Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

In addition to Tylenol, there has been conflicting messaging on a host of vaccines, anti-depressants and whether ingredients in shots are safe. It’s confusing patients and forcing doctors to be on the front lines of allaying their concerns. Bloomberg News Health Reporter Jessica Nix and Dr. Todd Ivey, fellow at the American College of Obstetricians, join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. They speak with hosts Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” Trump said Monday at a White House event alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his health secretary. Monday’s announcement was the latest example of how Kennedy and Trump have sought to upend health guidance and practices in their administration. While there have been numerous studies into the cause of autism, decades of scientific research have yet to identify just one cause for the condition.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on the world leaders to support Moldova in the face of Russia’s alleged attempts to influence its parliamentary election on Sunday.
“Georgia is dependent on Russia, and for many many years Belarus has been moving toward dependence on Russia,” Zelenskiy said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. “Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too.”
The small country, sandwiched between war-torn Ukraine and the European Union and NATO member state Romania, is a key battleground between pro-European and pro-Russian political forces. The Sept. 28 election comes less than a year after a referendum on whether Moldova should pursue EU membership passed by a wafer-thin margin amid claims by the government of Kremlin interference.
Bloomberg reported this week that Russia has devised a plan to intervene in elections in Moldova and disrupt the government’s efforts to keep the country on the path toward European Union membership.
The multi-pronged strategy was finalized in spring and coordinated directly by the Kremlin. The goal is to undermine the chances of President Maia Sandu’s Party of Action and Solidarity in the Sept. 28 vote and ultimately see her removed from power, the documents citing the internal Russian plans suggest.

US President Donald Trump said Tuesday there were two things he got from the United Nations: “a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.”
The teleprompter malfunctioned during his grievance-laden speech before the General Assembly. Another snag occurred when First Lady Melania Trump stepped onto an escalator at the New York headquarters and it ground to a halt, likely because a safety mechanism was triggered by someone in the US delegation, according to the UN.
Still, Trump’s spokeswoman suggested someone at the UN may have purposefully caused the escalator mishap. Now the Secret Service is investigating if both the teleprompter and the escalator were tampered with, according to people familiar with the matter. The seemingly minor episodes risked becoming a fresh source of friction after Trump blasted the UN as an ineffectual talking shop during his speech to the world body.
“I know that we have people, including United States Secret Service, who are looking into this to try to get to the bottom of it and if we find these were UN staffers who were purposely trying to trip up, literally trip up the president and the first lady of the United States, there better be accountability for those people and I will personally see to it,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday night on Fox News.
It was determined after looking at the escalator’s central processing unit that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism was activated, according to a statement from UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.

It was the second time I had defeated the government-backed candidate. The first was in 2019 when the mayoral elections were annulled on flimsy pretexts; voters returned to the polls and handed us a victory by an even larger margin.But this year, democracy in Turkey has entered its most perilous phase. The process started in Marchon the eve of my nomination as the presidential candidate of the CHP, the century-old Republican People’s party. This was when my university degree was abruptly annulled. Why is this relevant? Because, under the Turkish constitution, one must have a university degree to be able to run for president. Soon after, I was accused of corruption and “aiding a terrorist organisation”. For six months, I have been behind bars, arrested on politically motivated corruption charges based on “anonymous” witnesses. In a country bound by the European convention on human rights, this is an outrage.From mayors in Adana and Antalya, to municipal staff in Istanbul, repression has reached every level. Hundreds of people languish in prison, including journalists, academics, businesspeople and students.Enes Hocaoğulları, a youth delegate to the Council of Europe, was detained for merely speaking out under Turkey’s vaguely worded laws on “misleading” the public. This shows how far the crackdown has gone. His release, after protests at home and abroad, is a small but telling victory for democratic resistance.Let me be clear about what is happening. In the arrogance of unchecked power, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is once more weaponising the courts against the democratic opposition. This time, opponents are being imprisoned and replaced with loyalists. Unable to shut down the CHP, the government is pursuing a case that will have the effect of erasing the CHP’s rising leadership by overturning the outcome of its 2023 national party congress. Earlier this month, a court moved to annul the CHP’s local congress in Istanbul, remove its chair and install a trustee.The case against the CHP, which the government keeps dragging out in hopes of destabilising the main opposition and removing its legitimate leadership, marks a turning point in the effective dismantling of political pluralism. A system where judges replace elected leaders with handpicked stand-ins is no democracy at all.Having hollowed out the republic’s institutions to build an authoritarian regime, Erdoğan now seeks to fabricate a compliant, hollow opposition. He intends to rewrite the rules so no genuine rival could survive, securing power in the style of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak or Syria’s Assads. These are deliberate methods likely to be copied elsewhere tomorrow unless democrats everywhere stand together to resist them.Erdoğan’s increasingly repressive tactics expose his eroding popular support and his desperate bid to preserve power. To avoid another defeat in the ballot box, he rewrites the rules. He relies on smear campaigns, corruption charges, efforts to divide the opposition and the ever-present “terrorist” label. Yet, this display of power has further undermined his legitimacy, leaving him increasingly dependent on a narrow minority and the machinery of the state.The people of Turkey are no longer deceived. Protests fill the streets, and polls consistently place CHP as the country’s leading party. Since 19 March, the day I was detained and jailed, millions of citizens, even in Erdoğan’s supposed strongholds, have been participating in peaceful protests to demand justice and change, despite the risk of arrest and police violence. This resistance reflects Turkey’s 150-year tradition of parliamentary democracy. But resistance alone is not enough.That is why the CHP is preparing a comprehensive roadmap for democratic transition, to build a resilient and inclusive alliance: win elections; stabilise the economy; restore judicial independence; combat corruption and organised crime; expand social rights; rebuild trust in institutions; and redefine Turkey’s role in a changing geopolitical landscape.Turkey’s fight for democracy, freedom and justice is not Turkey’s alone. If a nation whose experience proves that democracy is a universal project slides deeper into autocracy, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.Yet I remain convinced: the will of the people will prevail. Our outrage in the face of injustices must be turned into a strategy. That strategy must involve building a new political culture and institutions that honour Turkey’s democratic legacy. If we achieve that, we will not only reclaim our democracy at home but help it rise again across the world.Ekrem Imamoğlu is the elected mayor of Istanbul and the presidential candidate for Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zelenskiy tells UN: world in most destructive arms race ever | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyX-getfeTs</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HyX-getfeTs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 17:54:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on world powers to work together to stop Russia's war in his country, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of seeking to expand the fighting beyond Ukraine.

He said "we do not seek nuclear weapons." US President Donald Trump ordered an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in June. Iran’s nuclear work has concerned the West for decades and tensions over the nature of its atomic program — which dates back to the 1950s — have frequently shaken oil markets and spurred fits of both conciliation and conflict with the US.

Abolfazl Zohrevand, a member of parliament’s National Security Committee, called the MiG-29s a “short-term solution” while Tehran awaits the more advanced Sukhoi Su-35 jets, signaling a broader push to strengthen its military capabilities. “Once these systems are fully in place, our enemies will understand the language of power,” Zohrevand told local media, highlighting Tehran’s determination to project strength as regional and global powers watch closely. reached out to Iran's Foreign Ministry for comment.The MiG-29 deliveries arrive in the wake of the recent 12-day conflict with Israel, which exposed weaknesses in Iran’s aging air force and defense network. Israeli strikes during the war targeted Iranian assets, highlighting vulnerabilities that Tehran is now moving to address. The new jets provide a boost while signaling Iran’s intent to rapidly modernize its aerial capabilities. The move underscores Tehran’s determination to rebuild its military strength and enhance deterrence amid ongoing Middle East tensions.“Russian MiG-29 fighter jets have arrived in Iran and are stationed in Shiraz, while Sukhoi Su-35 jets are also on the way,” Zohrevand said. He added that China’s HQ-9 air defense system and Russia’s S-400 system were being supplied to Iran “in significant numbers.”Following recent clashes with Israel, Zohrevand emphasized that the MiG-29 jets are part of a broader effort to rapidly strengthen Iran’s air capabilities. The aircraft serve as an interim measure until Su-35s arrive, though Moscow has not yet officially confirmed any shipments.Aging Fleet and Air Defense GapsIran has long struggled to modernize its air force, which still relies heavily on U.S.-made jets purchased before the 1979 revolution, supplemented by a small number of Russian aircraft and domestically upgraded platforms. The country’s vulnerabilities were exposed earlier this year when Israeli strikes destroyed its last Russian-supplied S-300 air defense systems, which Tehran had acquired in 2016, leaving significant gaps in its protective network.To compensate, Iran has bolstered its indigenous air defenses by developing the Bavar-373 long-range surface-to-air missiles, the Khordad and Sayyad missile systems, the Arman long-range anti-ballistic missile defenses, and the S-200 Ghareh long-range surface-to-air missiles.Beyond its military buildup, Iran is seeking to leverage its growing capabilities diplomatically. Referencing the Cairo agreement signed earlier this year with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Zohrevand described the recent acquisitions as a “victory card” at a time when European powers were considering reimposing United Nations sanctions on Iran. “We should not view this negatively; it strengthens our hand,” he underlined, suggesting that Tehran sees its expanding air and missile capabilities both as a deterrent and as a tool to strengthen its position in international negotiations.Iran’s military modernization indicates additional deliveries of advanced aircraft and air defense systems in the near term, signaling Tehran’s intention to close capability gaps and enhance its aerial power. These upgrades could reshape the regional balance of power by complicating Israel’s operational planning and challenging U.S. influence in the Middle East.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Families of victims aboard American Eagle Flight 5342 hold press conference</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn_-JkXf-Rk</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zn_-JkXf-Rk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:11:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as the families of victims aboard American Eagle Flight 5342, along with their attorneys, hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., regarding the Jan. 29 mid-air collision with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter.

Marko Mihkelson, chairman of the Estonian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote on social media, "we got it," echoing a brisk acceptance in Tallinn.Estonia's foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, earlier told the Kyiv Independent that the Baltic state and its allies must be prepared to both intercept and, if necessary, down aircraft that violate its sovereign airspace."The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft," Tsahkna said on Sept. 23. "This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders."The reactions follow several recent incidents that raised alarm among NATO members.Three Russian MiG-31 fighters entered Estonian airspace on Sept. 19 over the Gulf of Finland for roughly 12 minutes before departing, prompting Tallinn to request consultations under NATO's Article 4. Days earlier, Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace during a mass attack on Ukraine, the first direct engagement of Russian military assets over NATO territory since the war began.NATO scrambled two Eurofighter jets over the Baltic Sea on Sept. 21 after an Il-20M reconnaissance plane was detected flying without a filed flight plan. The alliance also launched the Eastern Sentry mission to reinforce air defenses along its eastern flank.Czech President Petr Pavel said on Sept. 20 that NATO needs to stay united and respond decisively to Russian provocations, including by a potential military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News that NATO had not discussed shooting down Russian jets unless they were attacking and that standard practice remains interception.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NATO faces a drone threat from Russia along Estonia’s border</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BvadXeDH8U</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9BvadXeDH8U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 14:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Along Estonia’s border with Russia, authorities are preparing for a potential conflict between NATO and Russia by extending a new border fence and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers.

3. Jimmy Kimmel returned to U.S. late-night television on Tuesday defending political satire against Trump administration "bullying", six days after his on-air remarks about the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk led Walt Disney to suspend his show.

4. President Donald Trump's approval ticked slightly lower in recent weeks as Americans worried about the health of the U.S. economy and the Republican's ability to contain rising prices, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.

5. If U.S. President Donald Trump really wants to win the Nobel peace prize, he needs to stop the war in Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday.

The storm is said to be the strongest cyclone so far this year. Now it is battering China's densely populated Guangdong province - after being downgraded from a super typhoon to a severe one. On its path across the region, Ragasa has already caused massive damage in other areas, especially Taiwan and the Northern Philippines. At least ten people there have been reported dead, including a number of fishermen at sea. Homes and infrastructure suffered damages as well, more than 20.000 people were displaced due to the typhoon.

"We never in our wildest dreams would have expected a 75% slowing of clinical progression," she said.None of the patients who have been treated are being identified, but one was medically retired and has returned to work. Others in the trial are still walking despite being expected to need a wheelchair.Treatment is likely to be very expensive. However, this is a moment of real hope in a disease that hits people in their prime and devastates families.Huntington's runs through Jack May-Davis' family. He has the faulty gene that causes the disease, as did his dad, Fred, and his grandmother, Joyce.Jack said it was "really awful and horrible" watching his dad's inexorable decline. The first symptoms appeared in Fred's late 30s, including changes in behaviour and the way he moved. He eventually needed 24/7 palliative care before he died at the age of 54, in 2016.Jack is 30, a barrister's clerk, newly engaged to Chloe and has taken part in research at UCL to turn his diagnosis into a positive.But he'd always known he was destined to share his father's fate, until today.Now he says the "absolutely incredible" breakthrough has left him "overwhelmed" and able to look to a future that "seems a little bit brighter, it does allow me to think my life could be that much longer".Huntington's disease is caused by an error in part of our DNA called the huntingtin gene.If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, there's a 50% chance that you will inherit the altered gene and will eventually develop Huntington's too.This mutation turns a normal protein needed in the brain – called the huntingtin protein – into a killer of neurons.The goal of the treatment is to reduce levels of this toxic protein permanently, in a single dose.The therapy uses cutting edge genetic medicine combining gene therapy and gene silencing technologies.It starts with a safe virus that has been altered to contain a specially designed sequence of DNA.This is infused deep into the brain using real-time MRI scanning to guide a microcatheter to two brain regions - the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This takes 12 to 18 hours of neurosurgery.The virus then acts like a microscopic postman – delivering the new piece of DNA inside brain cells, where it becomes active.This turns the neurons into a factory for making the therapy to avert their own death.The cells produce a small fragment of genetic material (called microRNA) that is designed to intercept and disable the instructions (called messenger RNA) being sent from the cells' DNA for building mutant huntingtin.This results in lower levels of mutant huntingtin in the brain.Results from the trial - which involved 29 patients - have been released in a statement by the company uniQure, but have not yet been published in full for review by other specialists.The data showed that three years after surgery there was an average 75% slowing of the disease based on a measure which combines cognition, motor function and the ability to manage in daily life.The data also shows the treatment is saving brain cells. Levels of neurofilaments in spinal fluid – a clear sign of brain cells dying – should have increased by a third if the disease continued to progress, but was actually lower than at the start of the trial."This is the result we've been waiting for," said Prof Ed Wild, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at UCLH."There was every chance that we would never see a result like this, so to be living in a world where we know this is not only possible, but the actual magnitude of the effect is breathtaking, it's very difficult to fully encapsulate the emotion."He said he was "a bit teary" thinking about the impact it could have on families.The treatment was considered safe, although some patients did develop inflammation from the virus that caused headaches and confusion that either resolved or needed steroid treatment.Prof Wild anticipates the therapy "should last for life" because brain cells are not replaced by the body in the same manner as blood, bone and skin are constantly renewed.Approximately 75,000 people have Huntington's disease in the UK, US and Europe with hundreds of thousands carrying the mutation meaning they will develop the disease.UniQure says it will apply for a licence in the US in the first quarter of 2026 with the aim of launching the drug later that year. Conversations with authorities in the UK and Europe will start next year, but the initial focus is on the US.Dr Walid Abi-Saab, the chief medical officer at uniQure, said he was "incredibly excited" about what the results mean for families, and added that the treatment had "the potential to fundamentally transform" Huntington's disease.However, the drug will not be available for everyone due to the highly complex surgery and the anticipated cost."It will be expensive for sure," says Prof Wild.There isn't an official price for the drug. Gene therapies are often pricey, but their long-term impact means that can still be affordable. In the UK, the NHS does pay for a £2.6m-per-patient gene therapy for haemophilia B.Prof Tabrizi says this gene therapy "is the beginning" and will open the gates for therapies that can reach more people.She paid tribute to the "truly brave" volunteers who took part in the trial, saying she was "overjoyed for the patients and families".She is already working with a group of young people who know they have the gene, but don't yet have symptoms – known as stage zero Huntington's – and is aiming to do the first prevention trial to see if the disease can be significantly delayed or even stopped completely.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks Rise After AI Sentiment Boost; Trump Shifts Tone on Ukraine | Bloomberg Brief 9/24/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFWHkNPepWM</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FFWHkNPepWM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:14:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US equity futures rise boosted by Alibaba on announcing more AI spending and on a collaboration with Nvidia.

Merz - who is facing his lowest approval ratings since taking office - made the comments during a debate over next year's draft budget. That budget proposal includes a drastic spending boost, and Germany's borrowing is set to triple compared to 2024. The biggest budget increase is in defense spending. The issue of borrowing limits is highly charged in Germany and led to the collapse of the previous governing coalition.

That is no longer an option</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/23/europe-china-us-superpower-ally-lost</link><author>/u/goldstarflag</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:44:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Europe’s relationship with the US is unmoored, but it has also lost its bearings with regard to China, caught by competing forces that pull and push in opposite directions.Europe’s China policy used to be a function of Washington’s. When Barack Obama tried and then failed to pivot to Asia in 2011, sucked into turmoil in the Middle East instead, Europeans lulled themselves into the belief that their relationship with Asia could continue to be driven by trade, with security an afterthought.Despite rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan strait, European governments viewed Asia, including China, through a predominantly economic lens. China’s belt and road initiative was initially seen as a purely economic endeavour, lacking strategic edge. It was only as US-China relations soured, under the first Trump administration and then especially under Joe Biden, that Brussels switched gears.China was no longer seen only as a partner, but more warily, as a competitor and systemic rival. Investment screening, tariffs and export controls entered the European lexicon when talking about China. The link to the US was clear. While the EU rejected any decoupling from China, considering it undesirable and impossible, it began advocating “de-risking” instead. Once unpacked, this is no different from other trademark European concepts such as strategic autonomy and economic security. But the timing and the framing of Brussels’s more hawkish line made it clear that its north star on China was Washington.This worked so long as the transatlantic relationship was strong and Washington’s approach to China was clear and predictable. None of that is true today. Toughening up to match China’s assertiveness, for instance, by accepting and even advocating for Nato’s role in east Asia, continues to anger Beijing.But it no longer necessarily rallies favour in Washington. The Trump administration may bully Europeans to inflict costs on China, for example by applying secondary sanctions on countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas. But this does not guarantee that Trump will stand by Europe on Ukraine, or that Washington has any intention of exerting meaningful economic pressure on Beijing. So far, it’s China that has retained the upper hand in the trade war with the US. Trump treats Europe as subservient: he’s happy to see it inflict economic pain on Beijing at its own cost, but wants to avoid incurring such costs himself. As with most things Trump-related, it’s a toss of the coin whether he escalates or strikes deals with Beijing, naturally over the heads of European and Asian partners.With Washington’s north star gone, Europeans are left figuring out what they actually think, and how they’ll act towards China. Should they double down on trade protectionism to counter the negative impact on Europe of Chinese industrial overcapacity? Should they encourage Chinese technology transfers to the continent, avoid a trade war and jointly develop a strategy with Asia to save the global trade order? Should they embrace Chinese green tech, aware that proceeding with the energy transition and meeting climate ambitions is impossible without it, or try to dilute green dependency on China? And in the global south, as the US exits from the development aid field, can the EU realistically counter China’s vast belt and road initiative, or should it reconcile itself to its own “global gateway” infrastructure initiative being complementary to it?None of these questions have simple answers. Making them harder still are two underlying dilemmas that lie at the heart of Europe’s own future.First is the future of liberal democracy in Europe. Democracy is under threat in the west. Far-right, nationalist and populist forces are on the rise, as is polarisation, radicalisation, disinformation and extremism, threatening fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the separation of powers. China, unlike Russia and the Maga movement in the US, does not explicitly back these far-right forces, nor does it appear to have any desire to export its model of government. However, given that China is the ultimate case of an economically successful authoritarian system, it inspires those in Europe who want to see their countries move in an illiberal direction. No wonder that China’s closest European partners are Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia, as was blatantly on display when their leaders (or, in Hungary’s case, foreign minister) attended China’s military parade in Beijing in September. When it comes to the magnetic draw that China exerts on authoritarian and illiberal forces in Europe, there’s not much European governments and institutions can expect from Beijing. The onus is on them to demonstrate that liberal democracy delivers.The second dilemma regards security, and in particular the war in Ukraine. While China claims to be neutral maintaining ties with Kyiv and Moscow – and, at least theoretically, supports sovereignty and territorial integrity – in practice it sides with Moscow. President Xi Jinping’s no-limits friendship with Vladimir Putin is increasingly on display, and Beijing’s peace efforts on Ukraine have proved empty. In fact, China has visibly benefited from the war, not only through cheap Russian oil and gas, but especially strategically: Russia has become the junior partner in the relationship.Europe cannot push China to turn its back on Russia, nor expect it to stop trading with Russia. But if China were truly neutral, it wouldn’t support Russia through the export of dual-use technology. If it genuinely wanted the war to end, it would exert pressure on Moscow, just like it did to mitigate Putin’s worst instincts when he irresponsibly threatened the use of nuclear weapons. Especially now that Trump’s failed diplomacy on Ukraine has revealed to all that it’s Putin, and Putin alone, that does not want the war to end.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionWhen I was in Beijing this month, I argued that Ukraine now represents a core interest for Europe, and that China’s stance on the war is the biggest thorn in Europe-China relations. I said that it was not only a question of values – on which, tragically, any remaining European credibility has collapsed since the Gaza war – but of security interests. The replies I got were telling. Just as Europeans now view their relationship with China through the lens of Russia, China sees Europe through the paradigm of its competition with the US. Beijing believes that if worst comes to worst in US-China relations, Europe would stand with Washington, notwithstanding Trump and the US’s abandonment and betrayal of Europe. For China, I was told, keeping Russia on side is a strategic must. In the current circumstances Russia trumps Europe from Beijing’s perspective. It’s hard not to see the logic.Russia represents a vital threat to European security and Europeans will bend over backwards to keep the US engaged in their defence. This is likely to fail – regardless of how much flattery and self-abasement they offer to Trump. And while Europe could potentially confront Russia without the US, it cannot do so while China is in its crosshairs too.This leaves Europe with no easy way out, but wishing the problem away is no answer.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israel closes main West Bank crossing into Jordan &apos;indefinitely&apos; | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wQdNW8WGZc</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5wQdNW8WGZc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:42:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Palestinian and Jordanian officials say Israel plans to close the West Bank Allenby Bridge Crossing "until further notice."

Fed policymakers give mixed messages, clouding the outlook for interest rates cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says there's no risk-free path ahead.

But President Trump was more positive in it and he showed that he wants to support Ukraine to the very end, so we understand now that we are ready to finish this war as quick as possible.”The US president has previously refused to fully back Mr Zelensky, pushing instead for an immediate end to the war rather than support Ukraine’s efforts to repel the invading forces.But now Mr Trump appears to have changed his tune, accusing Russia of “fighting aimlessly” in his Truth Social post.In response to the U-turn, Mr Zelensky said the post was a “big shift”, adding: “He is ready to give Ukraine security guarantees after this war will finish.”He said: “Trump is a game-changer by himself if he will be sure [of] Ukraine [winning]. He is... closer now to this situation.”The Ukrainian president said Putin had shared “fairytales” with Mr Trump about Russia’s ability on the field, while he and the US president had held a “good, constructive meeting” together earlier in the day.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Typhoon Ragasa hits Hong Kong with massive waves and trees blown down</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J-qrbBwKHo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6J-qrbBwKHo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 07:32:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest in years, whipped waves taller than lampposts onto Hong Kong promenades and halted life on the southern Chinese coast early Wednesday after leaving deadly destruction in Taiwan and the Philippines.

Donald Trump said ABC's decision to reinstate Kimmel "puts the network in jeopardy."

US President Donald Trump on Monday expressed his surprise on his social media platform Truth Social that ABC have lifted the suspension of late night show host Jimmy Kimmel. "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" was taken off air six days ago when he was indefinitely suspended over comments he made about Charlie Kirk's death. 

Trump's threat
"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back," Trump wrote Tuesday. "The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his "talent" was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy," he wrote. Trump went on to accuse broadcaster ABC of "playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE," and said Kimmel was "yet another arm of the DNC," short for Democratic National Committee.  "I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative."

Will the Hungarian police chief’s suicide be a turning point in the 2026 parliamentary election campaign?On the opposition side, commentators have described the event as a murder committed by pro-Fidesz media figures. In contrast, government representatives have expressed condolences while condemning those who they say are trying to exploit a man’s death for political gain. Notably, both comments on articles and posts linked to Minister János Lázár, who has ties to the town, have been disabled.Will the Hódmezővásárhely police chief’s death act as a wake-up call?The death of Zsolt Szabó, police chief of Hódmezővásárhely, could mark a turning point in an election campaign that has increasingly turned hostile. Péter Márki-Zay, the town’s mayor and the 2022 joint opposition prime ministerial candidate, called Szabó “an excellent father, an accomplished officer, and an honourable citizen.” Last night, a crowd gathered with candles in front of the police station to pay tribute to his memory. The mayor shared a live video from the vigil:Days before his death, the local website promenad24.hu and another Fidesz-linked outlet published reports alleging that public safety in the town was deteriorating because Szabó was distracted by personal matters. He was also criticised for allowing a chalk-drawing competition near the Batida Castle, where some of the drawings reportedly included calls for a bloody political reckoning. According to Márki-Zay, the controversial additions were added later by unknown individuals, and the original drawings were not objectionable.Out of respect for Szabó and his family, no further details from the articles will be shared here. Furthermore, Blikk questioned promenad24.hu about the evidence behind their claims, but the site has since deleted the article, disabled comments on its posts, and issued a terse statement saying the article was removed “solely out of deference to the deceased.”Opposition: murder; Government parties: desecration of the deadPolitical reaction has been swift and widespread. While expressing his condolences, the mayor of Hódmezővásárhely also voiced his anger, suggesting the defamatory reports contributed to the police chief’s death. Péter Magyar, leader of the Tisza party, made a similar comment and added, “We want a country where politics doesn’t kill. A nation where people need not live in fear.”János Lázár, Minister for Construction and a former Fidesz MP for Hódmezővásárhely, posted a brief statement on Facebook, saying he didn’t know Szabó well but remarked, “Anyone who dares to draw irreversible conclusions from a suicide, names a scapegoat, and incites a lynch mob is a scoundrel.” Lázár accused Márki-Zay of crossing a “blood-red line” by attempting to gain political capital from the tragedy.To read or share this article in Hungarian, click here: Helló Magyar]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Micron Gives Upbeat Forecast Amid AI Equipment Demand</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2_fAKsGvDQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/O2_fAKsGvDQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 05:44:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Micron gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, helped by demand for artificial intelligence equipment.

A country's withdrawal from the ICC officially takes effect one year after the UN is notified.Military junta forces are in control of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, following coups in the Sahel countries between 2020 and 2023. They make up the only three members of the Confederation of Sahel States.Their armies have faced accusations of crimes against civilians, as violence has escalated in the region against jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.They had rejected Ecowas' demands for them to restore democratic rule.Russia has strengthened its ties with the three Sahel countries over recent years, which have all become increasingly isolated from the West, notably the former regional colonial power France.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zelenskyy: Putin’s Russia is nothing without China</title><link>https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/09/24/7532212</link><author>/u/EclipticElsa</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 05:13:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Colombian president Gustavo Petro calls out Trump on boat strikes | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oLeyCByqQBA</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oLeyCByqQBA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 04:56:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Colombian President Gustavo Petro hits out at President Donald Trump in his United Nations General Assembly speech, calling for "criminal proceedings" over missile attacks on suspected drug-running boats in Caribbean waters.

Taiwan has been hit hard by Ragasa, one of the strongest storms in years, which has already caused deaths in the Philippines and is now lashing Hong Kong. The storm struck Hong Kong early Wednesday with winds of up to 195 kph (120 mph), toppling trees, flooding coastal neighborhoods and forcing people to seek refuge in temporary shelters. Authorities reported at least 13 injuries and suspended flights, schools and train services. The storm also caused infrastructure damage as it ripped off the top of a pedestrian footbridge. The Hong Kong Observatory warned of a "significant" storm surge with "two to three meters of rise in water level expected over the coast of Hong Kong." Earlier, the observatory issued the highest level of typhoon warning overnight.
Meanwhile, Ragasa forced the relocation of more than a million people in southern China's Guangdong province. The storm is forecast to make landfall later on Wednesday between the cities of Taishan and Zhanjiang, the national weather agency said. Chinese authorities have ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the south. Ragasa has battered the region since Monday. In the northern Philippines, three people have been killed, with thousands displaced by floods and landslides, officials said. A lake burst caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa killed at least 14 people and left 124 others missing in eastern Taiwan, officials said on Wednesday.

In a social media post, Donald Trump said 'Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act'.  

He made these remarks after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Trump had earlier suggested Kyiv would likely need to give up land to Moscow in a potential peace deal. During the meeting, Trump also said he would back NATO countries that shoot down Russian fighter jets violating their airspace, but direct US involvement would depend on the circumstances.

It's the latest instance of the White House weighing in on heated health issues. Experts say many of the claims are dangerous misinformation. 

Trump said his warning not to take Tylenol, whose active ingredient is paracetamol, was based on some studies that have linked the drug use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children.

On 11 September, the former paratrooper was sentenced to 27 years in jail for trying to stage a military coup after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.But the South American leftist warned the global threat persisted. “All around the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and suffocate freedoms. They worship violence, glorify ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,” Lula said.US-Brazil relations have foundered in the lead up to the annual summit, with the US president slapping 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports as a result of what he called the “political execution” of his rightwing ally.Twenty-four hours before Lula’s speech Trump officials announced new sanctions against Brazilian authorities, revoking the visas of the country’s attorney general, Jorge Messias, and six other officials. It also hit the wife of Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge who presided over Bolsonaro’s trial, with Magnitsky sanctions usually used to punish the perpetrators of major human rights abuses such as war crimes or torture“Let this be a warning to others who threaten US interests by protecting and enabling foreign actors like Moraes: you will be held accountable,” , Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said on X.Lula hit back at the UN, telling delegates: “There is no justification for unilateral and arbitrary measures against our institutions and our economy. Aggression against the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable.”Speaking immediately after Lula, Trump accused Brazil of “censorship, repression … judicial corruption and [the] targeting of political critics”. But, unexpectedly, the US president left the door open to a reconciliation with his South American counterpart, who he ran into when arriving at the UN headquarters. “I saw him, he saw me and we embraced,” Trump said of Lula.“We had a good talk and we agreed to meet next week ... at least for about 39 seconds we had excellent chemistry – it’s a good sign,” added Trump, who made no mention of Bolsonaro in his speech.The US pressure campaign has so far failed to save Bolsonaro’s skin. The 70-year-old politician is under house arrest and is expected to be taken into custody before the end of the year, with a maximum security jail in the capital Brasília one possible destination.On Monday, Brazil’s government voiced “profound indignation” over the latest US sanctions, calling them an insult to “a democracy that successfully defended itself against an attempted coup d’état” and to “201 years of friendship” between the two nations.Trump’s pressure campaign also appears to have boosted Lula’s chances of winning a historic fourth term in next year’s election. Lula’s sagging approval ratings have rebounded in recent weeks, with the leftwing veteran positioning himself as a flag-waving patriot fending off the gringo threat.“Before the eyes of the world, Brazil sent a message to all would-be autocrats and those who support them. Our democracy and our sovereignty are non-negotiable,” Lula, 79, told the UN assembly to applause.In another indirect swipe at Trump, Lula criticised the recent US attacks on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 17 people. “Using lethal force in situations ​that do not constitute armed conflicts amounts to executing people without​ a judgment,” Lula said, calling for the region to remain “a zone of peace”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is the H-1B visa, and what impact will Trump’s crackdown on it have?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d5aIKSkqujc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d5aIKSkqujc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 22:08:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Trump administration’s abrupt decision to slap a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas has stunned and confused employers, students and workers from the United States to India and beyond.

Trump argued for lower levels of global migration and urged a turn away from climate change policies in a wide-ranging address that leveled scathing criticism of world leaders.
 
The 56-minute speech was a rebuke to the world body and a return to form for Trump, who routinely bashed the U.N. during his first term as president.

General Assembly, President Donald Trump emphasized his new position that Ukraine can win back all territory lost to Russia during a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.“I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” Trump wrote. “With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.”The strengthened support from Trump, if it sticks, is a huge win for Zelenskyy, who has urged the American president to  on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war. It was a departure from  that Ukraine would never be able to reclaim all the territory that Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. That had disheartened Zelenskyy, Europeans and Ukrainians and called into question the U.S. commitment to U.N. principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. But now, Trump’s view of the battlefield coincides more with Ukraine’s, Zelenskyy said.“Trump is a game changer by himself,” Zelenskyy told reporters after their meeting.Trump needles Russia about war in Ukraine“Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,” Trump wrote on social media. “This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like ‘a paper tiger.’”In his speech to the General Assembly, Trump said the  was making Russia “look bad” because it was “supposed to be a quick little skirmish.”“It shows you what leadership is, what bad leadership can do to a country,” he said. “The only question now is how many lives will be needlessly lost on both sides.”Before meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump said the “biggest progress” toward ending the conflict “is that the Russian economy is terrible right now.” Zelenskyy said he agreed with Trump’s call for European nations to further halt imports of Russian oil and natural gas.“We have great respect for the fight that Ukraine is putting up,” Trump told Zelenskyy, who replied that he had “good news” from the battlefield.How Trump’s stance has shifted on UkraineBefore his  with Putin last month, Trump repeated that any resolution to the war would require “some land swapping.”Following those meetings, Trump announced he was  between Putin and Zelenskyy. But Putin hasn’t shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine.European leaders as well as American lawmakers, including some Republican allies of Trump, have urged the president to dial up stronger sanctions on Russia.“In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly,” Trump told the General Assembly.However, he repeated his calls for Europe to “step it up” and stop buying Russian oil, the engine feeding Putin’s war machine.Push for sanctions and cutting off Russian oilEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said before meeting with Trump that Europe would be imposing more sanctions and tariffs on Russia and that the bloc would be further reducing its imports of Russian energy.Zelenskyy, speaking at a special U.N. Security Council session on Ukraine, also appealed for stronger U.S. pressure on Russia.Russia denigrated the Security Council meeting as just the New York stop in the world tour of a “former actor,” a reference to Zelenskyy.“There is no added value for the establishment of peace in Ukraine generated from today’s meeting,” said Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador to the U.N. “This will merely become yet another shameful episode in the market of hypocrisy.”European leaders have supported Zelenskyy’s diplomatic efforts, with some alarmed by the possibility that the war  as they are facing what they have called Russian provocations.“I welcome the fact that the president of the United States believes in Ukraine’s ability not only to hold the course” but to prevail, French President Emmanuel Macron said.Trump said he would back NATO countries that choose to shoot down intruding Russian planes, but said direct U.S. involvement would depend on the circumstances. New strikes in Ukraine as toll of war growsThe full-scale war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, is taking a heavy toll on Ukrainian civilians. Russia said it shot down three dozen Ukrainian drones heading toward Moscow, while Ukraine said Russian missiles, drones and bombs killed at least two civilians.The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also said this month that Ukrainian civilian casualties increased by 40% in the first eight months of this year compared with 2024, as Russia escalated its long-range missile and localized drone strikes.A U.N. Human Rights Office report released Tuesday described the dire situation of thousands of civilians detained by Russia in areas of Ukraine it has captured.“Russian authorities have subjected Ukrainian civilian detainees in occupied territory to torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, in a widespread and systematic manner,” the report said.Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. AP reporters Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
