At the ceremony in the adminstrative capital Dodoma, Hassan said it's time to unite the country. The electoral commission said she won around 97% of the vote. The elections had been marred by deadly violence. Demonstrators took to the streets to protest the exclusion of Hassan's main challengers. The opposition says hundreds of people were killed by police in the unrest. The government denies use of excessive force.

Deogratias Munishi speaks for Tanzania's main opposition party Chadema, which was barred from the election. He talks to DW from Nairobi, Kenya, to share his take on the president's 97% election victory.

This is a critical moment in the global economy — or an important moment in the global economy. It's a critical one for our country."Losing the budget vote would plunge the country into an election a little more than six months after the last campaign.Carney was asked whether he was prepared to fight an election on the upcoming fiscal plan.“I'm always prepared to stand up for the right thing,” he responded.On Tuesday, Carney said the Liberals will begin the process of making what he calls "generational investments” in the Canadian economy and the country’s infrastructure. He plans to restructure the way federal finances are presented and promises to bring Canada's operating account back into balance within three years.WATCH | Supporting Carney's first budget won't be easy, NDP MP says:Opposition parties weigh their optionsThe Conservatives and the NDP are doing a lot of soul-searching this weekend.For the Conservatives there’s the political optics of supporting an agenda they don’t like.Even still, Conservative sources have told CBC News that they don't want to fight an election right now but will do it if they have to.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has made a series of demands, including scrapping the industrial carbon tax and keeping the deficit below $42 billion.The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates the shortfall in the current budget year will be $46 billion but will rise to $75 billion next year.For New Democrats, getting behind the Liberals may be even more of a stretch. Carney is planning increased defence spending but has also asked the rest of the government to find program reductions of 7.5 per cent in the next fiscal year, 2026-27, rising to 15 per cent in 2028-29.Ad is 'not something I would have done'Meanwhile, Carney confirmed during his media availability that he apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over Ontario anti-tariff ads that scuttled trade talks.“The president was offended by the ad. And it's not something I would have done,” Carney said referring, to the ad buy. “I'm the one who is responsible in my role as prime minister for the relationship with the president of the United States, and the federal government is responsible for the foreign relationship with the U.S. government. So, things happen, we take the good with the bad, and I apologized."The prime minister also confirms that he saw the ad beforehand and that he told Ontario Premier Doug Ford that he didn’t think it was a good idea.The Ontario government, in mid-October, launched a one-minute television ad in the United States featuring clips from former president Ronald Reagan’s April 1987 radio address about free trade.In the full address, Reagan defended a narrow application of tariffs against Japan while condemning their use more broadly. The former president was a free-trade supporter and one of the driving forces toward the original Canada-U.S. free-trade deal in 1988.Days after the ad first aired, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute criticized the Ontario government on social media, and Trump abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, calling the ad fraudulent and “FAKE.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One year long anti government &amp; anti corruption protests in Serbia explained in five pictures</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1olv7h8/one_year_long_anti_government_anti_corruption/</link><author>/u/Rare-North-6202</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 18:29:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Survivor describes fleeing mass shootings in Sudan&apos;s al-Fashir | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiii28_pp_I</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Wiii28_pp_I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 18:08:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Survivors recount terrifying escape from Sudanese city of Al-Fashir after paramilitaries seize control.

The museum fully opens its doors next week. 

One of Egypt's world-famous artifacts outside of the country has been on display for over a century in Germany's capital Berlin.  
German archeologists found the bust of ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti in 1912 and took it from Egypt to Germany. Egypt wants it back. 

Sebastian Conrad, Professor of Modern History at the Freie Universität Berlin and author of "The Queen – Nefertiti's Global Career."

It helps troops prepare for combat and train in realistic scenarios. that shows the position of USS Iwo Jima, the ship where these live-shooting drills were happening. The imagery shows the ship less than 200km away from the coastline of Venezuela.USS Iwo Jima is anamphibious assault ship that serves as a core component of US expeditionary forces, capable of launching amphibious invasions.USS Iwo Jima was also seen accompanied by two other USS destroyers, within around 20km of each other.The ship's arrival follows the announcement that the USS Gerald R Ford Aircraft carrier is also being moved towards the Caribbean Sea, with three US destroyers alongside it.Sean Parnell, assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs, said in a statement on X on 24 October that the forces will "enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle" transnational criminal organisations.He was thought to be describing fishing boats which they suspected of trafficking drugs, but so far there is no evidence to confirm this.The deployment means there will be 14% of the US Navy's fleet in the Caribbean, showing a significant build-up of force.USS Gerald R Ford was spotted just off the coast of Italy on its way to the Caribbean on 29 October.Mr Cancian, senior advisor of defence and security at the Centre for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), told Sky News: "The United States only has 11 carriers, three are at sea at any one time. So, moving one of them into the Caribbean is very significant, it does a couple of things. It puts more pressure on the Maduro regime, and it brings a lot of combat power into the Caribbean."He described the USS Gerald R Ford as a "use it or lose it" asset, saying "it's so powerful and so scarce, carrier strike groups, that other regional commanders will want to use the battle group".He added, when the airstrike carrier arrives in the Caribbean, a decision will have to be made."If the administration wants to conduct strikes, the arrival of the Ford would open that window for those attacks," he said.On 30 October, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said the Trump administration has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs.Is the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier the best military asset for targeting drug boats?Nick Brown, director at Janes defence intelligence company, told Sky News the "Gerald R Ford is the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier and the largest warship currently in US service".He said there are 4,805 crew members on board and a full range of precision air-to-surface bombs, missiles and rockets, "able to tackle a wide variety of tactical and strategic targets".The aircraft carrier also carries an abundance of fighter jets, typically 24 F/A-18s and 24 F-35s.Mr Cancian said: "It's not a very good asset for countering drug traffic. The strike aircraft are very powerful, but they move too fast to identify small boats. There are some helicopters that could help, but what the carrier is very good at is attacks against adversary military forces or targets ashore."The strike aircraft operate at 500, 600mph. So, they're going very fast. And to spot a small boat and then to identify it, very difficult."Increasing pressure in the skiesAs well as the sea, the US appears to have been more active in the air over the Caribbean Sea. Flight tracking data shows the US have flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s.The B1-B bomber is primarily a fast, heavy-hitting conventional "bomb truck" designed rapidly to deliver massive amounts of precision weapons, while the B-52 bomber is a versatile, long-range "missile truck".Flight tracking data from 27 October shows two B1-B bomber jets flying over the Caribbean Sea."The administration has flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s. So, they have been steadily increasing the pressure," Mr Cancian said.Three B-52 bombers were also seen on flight tracking on 30 October, leaving from Jacksonville (Florida) and Shreveport (Louisiana). They circled their surrounding areas for two hours before returning to their base.The satellite imagery below shows six F35-B fighter jets, capable of performing air-to-surface, electronic warfare, intelligence gathering, and air-to-air missions simultaneously at Puerto Rico on 17 October.Uptick of strikes in the Pacific US Southern Command have been criticised for choosing targets in the Caribbean Sea rather than the Eastern Pacific.Mr Cancian explained that "much of the drug traffic that comes to the United States allegedly comes along the Pacific route... so not focusing on that flow" was considered curious.On 28 October, the US Southern Command defended their operational targets in a post on X saying: "The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we're defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them."The Data X Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

And, with new congressional momentum and a victory in midterm elections, Argentina’s President Javier Milei gets the electorate’s buy-in to continue economic reforms that have had mixed results. Plus, Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” warns that the race to build smarter machines is outpacing efforts to control them, and that humanity must act before it’s too late.

She faced 16 candidates from smaller parties.The October 29, 2025, election was marred by violence as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest the vote and stop the counting of votes. The military has been deployed to help police quell riots. Internet connectivity has been on and off in the East African nation, disrupting travel and other activities.The protests have spread across Tanzania, and the government has postponed the reopening of universities, which had been set for October 3, 2025.Tanzanian authorities have not said how many people have been killed or injured in the violence. A spokesman for the United Nations (U.N.) human rights office, Seif Magango, on Friday (October 31, 2025) told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video from Kenya that credible reports of 10 deaths were reported in the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam, alongside Shinyanga and Morogoro towns.Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running.At stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country toward political change.Still, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide.Rights groups, including Amnesty International, cited a pattern of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and extrajudicial killings in Tanzania ahead of the polls.In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.Ms. Hassan oversaw "an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X (formerly Twitter) and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.” The political manoeuvring by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Ms. Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region. A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Ms. Hassan extends with her victory.CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus, and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years. Ms. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as Vice-President without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly not long after the start of his second term.The orderly transition sustained Tanzania's reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM's considerable support across the country, especially among rural vote.

A proposal to oblige online platforms to scan private messages for images of child abuse will be made voluntary instead. The decision was announced by Danish Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard on Thursday evening.The European Commission launched the Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse (CSAR), commonly known as 'chat control' in 2022. Denmark, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, has made the protection of minors on the internet one of its focal points, and hopes to find an agreement before the end of the year.However, earlier in its presidency, Denmark reinstated a proposal to require platforms and messaging services to use detection technology, including on encrypted apps such as Signal and WhatsApp, as part of CSAR. That decision sparked major controversy across the EU due to privacy concerns.Several member states, including Germany, have described the plan as "disproportionate". Justice minister Stefanie Hubig has said that "chat control without cause should be taboo in a constitutional state". The European Parliament has also voiced strong opposition to the measure. Universal opposition in BelgiumBelgium has not yet taken an official position on chat control. During a recent debate in the Chamber, Interior minister Bernard Quintin stressed the need for "a balanced and proportionate solution" that protects both privacy and the fight against child abuse.Notably, not a single political party expressed support for the proposal during that debate. Open VLD MP Kjell Vander Elst called the measure "totally disproportionate," while Vlaams Belang’s Barbara Pas said it would lead "straight to a totalitarian control state". Denmark maintains that safeguards are included: only after judicial approval could a chat service be required to screen users’ images, with text messages excluded from detection. But N-VA MP Jeroen Bergers argued that even then, the measure remains "a flagrant violation of privacy and letter secrecy".Due to the widespread opposition, the Danish presidency has now decided to back away from the controversial measure. Screening for images of child abuse would be voluntary rather than mandatory, Euractiv reported on Thursday evening. With this change, Denmark hopes to reach an agreement, as time is running out to adopt new legislation. A transitional arrangement, under which internet platforms voluntarily screen for the dissemination of child sexual abuse material, expires in April next year.Danish Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard.

According to HUR, all three lines of the pipeline exploded simultaneously on the evening of October 31 in the Ramensky district near Moscow, rendering the system inoperative.The operation was confirmed by Ukraine’s military intelligence service on November 1. HUR reported that despite anti-drone defenses and armed security protecting the facility, “all three lines used to transport gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel were successfully and simultaneously destroyed.”The “Koltsovoy” pipeline served as a critical logistical link between several Russian refineries and military storage facilities. According to HUR, the system received fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Moscow, and had an annual capacity of up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel, and 1.6 million tons of gasoline. Russian emergency and security services reportedly arrived at the scene soon after the explosions, but the damage has left the infrastructure inoperable.HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov previously noted that Ukraine’s precision strikes on Russian logistics infrastructure had already inflicted greater losses on the Kremlin’s war machine than international sanctions. “In reality, our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” Budanov said earlier this year. “It’s simply a mathematical truth.”Earlier, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) and HUR carried out a covert operation that destroyed one of Russia’s top-secret “Oreshnik” strategic missile systems at the Kapustin Yar test range. According to SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk, it was a “100% successful strike,” personally overseen by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After stopping all buses and trains in Serbia to reduce numbers on commemoration day in Novi Sad, now they also cut almost whole town today from the water.</title><link>https://www.021.rs/novi-sad/servisne-informacije/425476/veliki-deo-novog-sada-bez-vode-zbog-nestanka-struje</link><author>/u/Old_Passenger7</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:22:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Royal historian Andrew Lownie has alleged the disgraced former prince went on a string of taxpayer-funded trips which doubled up as holidays amid his “midlife crisis" in the early 2000s. It came after his brother, then-Prince Charles, reportedly advised against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role in 2001 as he would just “chase women and play golf”.“In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women," Mr Lonie told the Daily Mail’s Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York podcast. “He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips." He added: “He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things.Where will Andrew live after being kicked out of Royal Lodge?Beatrice and Eugenie quietly left UK while Andrew was being stripped of titles“There was a famous trip to Thailand - for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did.“Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian claimed this figure has been verified by multiple sources, including a member of Thailand's royal family.Ian Proud, who headed up the political branch of the UK embassy in Thailand, has said the royal’s promiscuous behaviour was common knowledge among staff."He also came out on private trips to see his bits of fluff on the side, where we played a much lighter role in stewarding him through," he told the Metro. He added Andrew liked to have his own private space when he was on business and preferred not to stay in the embassy itself."When I was there he preferred a particular high end hotel because he liked the nightclub in the basement there with the floozies and so on," Mr Proud said.Andrew’s fall from grace continued rapidly this morning as he was swiftly removed from the Official Roll of the Peerage, the public record of peers and peerages of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.The development marks a key step in formally removing his titles. Dukes, including the Duke of York, are listed on the roll of the peerage maintained at the Crown Office.As Lord Chancellor, David Lammy is responsible for maintaining the peerage roll. Andrew is still eighth in line to the throne behind Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Prince Harry, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.The only way Andrew could be removed from the line of succession would be through an Act of Parliament, but it would also require the consent of all other Commonwealth realms.Buckingham Palace said Andrew has agreed to leave the Windsor residence as his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continue to cause controversy.It is understood that although Andrew denies the accusations, Buckingham Palace considers the friendship a “serious lapses of judgment”.A statement released by the Palace on Thursday evening said: "His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew."Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>APEC Summit in South Korea closes with joint commitment to growth, AP explains</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQB8Gxq8Rek</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KQB8Gxq8Rek?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:05:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After two days of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju, APEC leaders issued a joint statement pledging greater cooperation to overcome shared challenges in a global economy hit hard by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies.

This was announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the state Assembly on Saturday.Vijayan made the announcement in a special session of the House convened on the occasion of Kerala '' or formation day."Today's Kerala Piravi marks a place in history because we have succeeded in making Kerala the first Indian state without extreme poverty. This Legislative Assembly has witnessed many historic laws and policy declarations. The Assembly now meets at a moment that marks yet another milestone in the creation of a Nava Kerala," he said.The Chief Minister said the eradication of extreme poverty was one of the key decisions taken at the first cabinet meeting after the new ministry was sworn in in 2021. "It was also the beginning of fulfilling one of the most important promises made to the people during the Legislative Assembly election," he added.The Congress-led UDF opposition called Vijayan's statements "pure fraud" and boycotted the session in protest.HOW DID KERALA COMBAT EXTREME POVERTY?With an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore, the state government ensured daily food for 20,648 families, with 2,210 of those receiving hot meals, necessary treatment and medicine for 85,721 individuals and housing for thousands.He said more than 5,400 new homes were built or are under construction, 5,522 homes were repaired and 2,713 landless families received land to build their residences.Besides that, 21,263 people received essential documents like ration cards, Aadhaar and pensions for the first time and 4,394 families are supported with livelihood projects, Vijayan had said in a post."Instead of a one-size-fits-all policy, the government identified 64,006 vulnerable families and created specific micro-plans for each one's unique needs," the Chief Minister had added.Local Self-Government Minister MB Rajesh on Friday said Kerala's Extreme Poverty Eradication Programme (EPEP) had been implemented through a transparent and participatory process involving micro-level projects across the state.The minister said the achievement was the result of coordinated efforts that transcended political boundaries, with participation from local bodies under both the LDF and UDF administrations.Slamming the UDF for opposing the government's initiative, Rajesh said, "It is not as if we suddenly decided one fine morning to announce that Kerala is free from extreme poverty."OPPOSITION BOYCOTTS SPECIAL SESSION, VIJAYAN TAKES DIGAs the special Assembly session commenced for the announcement on Kerala being free from extreme poverty, Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan said the Chief Minister's statement was "pure fraud" and in "contempt" of House rules."So, we cannot join in that and are completely boycotting the session," Satheesan said. The opposition then walked out of the House shouting slogans.Responding to the opposition's allegation, Vijayan said the UDF was referring to its own behaviour when they say "fraud". "We only say what we can implement. We have implemented what we had said. That is our reply to the opposition leader," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bosnia and Herzegovina: The horse whisperer | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvEHKM5S04</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NEvEHKM5S04?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 07:19:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lamija Džigal-Bektešević protects Bosnian Mountain Horses and offers riding therapy for people with disabilities.

It just isn’t admitting as much</title><link>https://theconversation.com/europe-is-allowing-itself-to-be-dominated-by-the-us-it-just-isnt-admitting-as-much-267060</link><author>/u/Crossstoney</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 01:51:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For 80 years, Europe maintained an asymmetric yet cooperative relationship with the United States. This imbalance, long accepted as the price of stability and protection, has shifted dramatically under US President Donald Trump. What was once a strategically uneven interdependence has become an unbreakable grip, which is used to exert pressure while being denied by its victims.In my book, l’Atlantisme est mort ? Vive l’Europe ! (Is Atlanticism Dead? Long Live Europe!), I describe this shift by introducing the concept of : a permitted grip in which Europeans, believing themselves to be partners, become dependent on a power that dominates them without their full awareness. does not merely refer to influence or soft power, but an internalised strategic subordination. Europeans justify this dependence in the name of realism, security, or economic stability, without recognising that it structurally weakens them.In Trump’s worldview, Europeans are no longer allies but freeloaders. The common market enabled them to become the world’s largest consumer zone and strengthen their companies’ competitiveness, including in the US market. Meanwhile, through NATO, they let Washington bear the costs of collective defence.The result? According to Trump, the US – because it is strong, generous, and noble – is being “taken advantage of” by its allies. This narrative justifies a shift: allies become resources to exploit. It is no longer cooperation, but extraction.Ukraine as a pressure leverThe war in Ukraine perfectly illustrates this logic. While the EU mobilized to support Kyiv, this solidarity became a vulnerability exploited by Washington. When the Trump administration temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to US intelligence, the Ukrainian army became blind. Europeans, also dependent on this data, were left half-blind.The administration’s move was not a mere tactical adjustment, but a strategic signal: European autonomy is conditional.In July 2025, the EU accepted a deeply unbalanced trade agreement imposing 15% tariffs on its products, without reciprocity. The Turnberry agreement was negotiated at Trump’s private estate in Scotland – a strong symbol of the personalization and brutalization of international relations.At the same time, the US stopped delivering weapons directly to Ukraine. Europeans now buy American-made arms and deliver them themselves to Kyiv. This is no longer partnership, but forced delegation.From partners to tributariesIn the logic of the MAGA movement, which is dominant within the Republican Party, Europe is no longer a partner. At best, it is a client; at worst, a tributary.In this situation, Europeans accept their subordination without naming it. This consent rests on two illusions: the idea that this dependence is the least bad option, and the belief that it is temporary.Yet many European actors – political leaders, entrepreneurs, and industrialists – supported the Turnberry agreement and the intensification of US arms purchases. In 2025, Europe accepted a perverse deal: paying for its political, commercial and budgetary alignment in exchange for uncertain protection.It is a quasi-mafia logic of international relations, based on intimidation, brutalization and the subordination of “partners”. Like Don Corleone in Frances Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Trump seeks to impose an unpredictable American protection in exchange for an arbitrary price set unilaterally by the US. and imperialism: two logics of dominationIt is essential to distinguish  from other forms of domination. Unlike President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whose imperialism relies on military violence, Trump’s US does not use direct force. When Trump threatens to annex Greenland, he exerts pressure but does not mobilize troops. He acts through economic coercion, trade blackmail, and political pressure.Because Europeans are partially aware of this and debate the acceptable degree of pressure, this grip is all the more insidious. It is systemic, normalized, and thus hard to contest.Putin’s regime, by contrast, relies on violence as a principle of government – against its own society and its neighbours. The invasion of Ukraine is its culmination. Both systems exercise domination, but through different logics: Russian imperialism is brutal and direct; US  is accepted, constraining, and denied.What makes  particularly dangerous is the denial that accompanies it. Europeans continue to speak of the transatlantic partnership, shared values, and strategic alignment. But the reality is one of accepted coercion.This denial is not only rhetorical: it shapes policies. European leaders justify trade concessions, arms purchases, and diplomatic alignments as reasonable compromises. They hope Trump will pass, that the old balance will return.But  is not a minor development. It is a structural transformation of the transatlantic relationship. And as long as Europe does not name it, it will keep weakening – strategically, economically and politically.Naming  to resist itEurope must open its eyes. The transatlantic link, once protective, has become an instrument of domination. The concept of  allows us to name this reality – and naming is already resisting.The question is now clear: does Europe want to remain a passive subject of US strategy, or become a strategic actor again? The answer will determine its place in tomorrow’s world.A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers.

Speaking to reporters, Trump confirmed that Orbán had appealed for an exception, citing Hungary’s reliance on Russian crude delivered through pipelines. “He asked for an exemption, but we didn’t grant it—not a single one. He’s my friend, yes, but he asked for an exemption,” Trump said.According to , Orbán had hoped to persuade Trump to make an exception for Hungary due to the country’s high dependence on pipeline energy supplies. The Hungarian leader earlier announced plans to discuss the issue during a meeting with Trump scheduled for November 7, where he also intended to seek a broader economic agreement with the United States.“Hungary is a country without access to the sea. We depend on the routes that bring energy to Hungary, which are mainly pipelines.

The aircraft reportedly had no active transponder and no filed flight plan, according to Poland’s Operational Command.While Polish officials stressed that the Russian plane did not enter their sovereign airspace, the encounter added to a growing list of similar provocations. “We thank the Air Force for their professionalism, vigilance, and exemplary execution of the mission,” the Polish Armed Forces said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). “Poland remains in full combat readiness and responds effectively to all provocative actions by the Russian Federation.”Over the past two months, Lithuania and Estonia have each reported unauthorized Russian planes entering their airspace — claims Moscow has denied. Russia maintains that all its flights are routine training missions and insists no borders have been violated.Still, the repeated incursions have led some NATO members to consider invoking Article Four, which calls for formal discussions when any member feels its territorial integrity or security is under threat.According to NATO, Russian aircraft traveling to and from the Kaliningrad region frequently fly close to alliance airspace without active transponders. In this latest incident, the Polish jets followed standard NATO procedures to escort the Russian plane safely out of the area.Newsweek has reached out to NATO and the U.S. State Department for comment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Bolivians celebrate Halloween in La Paz</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIwmC7SlKm0</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wIwmC7SlKm0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 22:19:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Families across Bolivia’s La Paz celebrate Halloween as costumes flood the city and streets close.

Britain's King Charles has begun the process of removing his brother Andrew's royal titles. The former prince has also been told to vacate his royal residence. For months, pressure to act has been mounting on the King over Andrew's links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew of sexual abuse, welcomed the decision. They are now calling for an investigation into the former prince, though Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.

The list of names and addresses will be shared with Ukraine’s international partners.“The first such list—more than 300 names and addresses of abducted children—will be on the desks of all leaders who are helping us,” Zelenskyy said in his evening address. He added that Ukraine continues “quiet diplomatic work” to secure the return of the children and counter Russian claims that it is unaware of their whereabouts.As of October 2025, Ukraine has confirmed the illegal deportation of over 19,000 children from its territory to Russia since the start of the full-scale invasion.The effort to return them involves not only Ukraine but also an International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, established last year and now joined by 41 countries and the Council of Europe.Earlier, it was reported that The United States Senate is scheduled to hold hearings concerning the issue of Russia’s mass abduction of Ukrainian children. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nobel Peace Prize Winner Says Maduro’s Time Is Up in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KICII-nR71E</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KICII-nR71E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 21:01:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg's Mishal Husain breaks down her interview with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who told her that she supports US military escalation in her country and says Maduro's time is over.

She joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to discuss the deal, and what other possible buyers might be out there.

A mortar hit the hospital. I was so worried because the woman's wounds were open, and everyone was running around me,' Dr Suhiba, a gynaecologist, told UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. The northeast African nation was plunged into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions about the future of the country between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the head of the paramilitary rebel group erupted. Following the most recent incident, allies of the army, the Joint Forces, said on Tuesday that the RSF 'committed heinous crimes against innocent civilians, where more than 2,000 unarmed citizens were executed and killed on October 26 and 27, most of them women, children and the elderly'. The World Health Organisation said the Saudi Maternity Hospital in El Fasher, the city's last remaining hospital, was on Sunday 'attacked for the fourth time in a month, killing one nurse and injuring three other health workers'Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the massacre captured bodies scattered across the floor amid debris The total death toll could not immediately be confirmed, but shocking satellite images taken after the fall of El Fasher showed evidence of the mass killings. Body-sized objects were seen in satellite images clustered around vehicles and nearby an RSF sand berm built around the city. There were reports of civilians being gunned down as they attempted to break out and flee the bloodshed. Analysis by the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which has been tracking the siege using open source images and satellite imagery, found clusters of objects 'consistent with the size of human bodies' and 'reddish ground discolouration' thought to be either blood or disturbed soil.A video released by local activists and authenticated by AFP on Tuesday showed a fighter known for executing civilians in RSF-controlled areas shooting a group of unarmed civilians sitting on the ground at point-blank range. Another video purportedly showed a child soldier murdering a grown man in cold blood, while one other clip showed RSF fighters executing civilians just moments after pretending to release them.A report published on Monday said the actions of the RSF 'may be consistent with war crimes and crimes against humanity and may rise to the level of genocide'.   Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, the head of the RSF has vowed the country would be unified by 'peace or through war'.The capture of El-Fasher, the last army holdout in the vast western region of Darfur, comes after more than 18 months of brutal siege, sparking fears of a return to the ethnically targeted atrocities of 20 years ago. UN chief Antonio Guterres called for an immediate end to military escalation in Sudan on Thursday after reports of the maternity hospital atrocity.Guterres said in a statement he was 'gravely concerned by the recent military escalation' in El-Fasher, calling for 'an immediate end to the siege & hostilities'.International powers have struggled for months to mediate an end to the fighting between the paramilitaries and the regular army, raging since April 2023.Daglo's paramilitaries now control most of western Sudan, Africa's third-largest country, while the regular army under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan dominates the north, east and centre.Satellite images have revealed the tragic aftermath of a 48-hour massacre in Sudan which saw over 2,000 civilians executed by paramilitary rebelsBodies and blood: The sand around the western city of El Fasher is now stained red with pools of blood so thick they can be seen from spaceWhile the army regained full control over the capital Khartoum in March, the RSF has set up a parallel administration in the southwestern city of Nyala.Analysts warn that the country is now de facto partitioned and may prove very hard to piece back together.Daglo said in a speech Wednesday that he was 'sorry for the inhabitants of El-Fasher for the disaster that has befallen them' and that civilians were off limits.The RSF - descended from Janjaweed militias that attacked non-Arab communities in Darfur two decades ago - has again been accused of carrying out ethnic genocide against civilians, with graphic videos circulating on social media.Sudanese Arabs are the dominant ethnic group in the country, but the majority in Darfur are from non-Arab communities such as the Fur people.The seizing of El-Fasher has left the RSF in control of a third of Sudan, with fighting now concentrated in the central Kordofan region.On Tuesday, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported five Sudanese volunteers killed and three missing in Bara, a city in Kordofan captured by the RSF last week.More than 33,000 people have fled El-Fasher since Sunday for the town of Tawila, about 40 miles to the west, which has already welcomed more than 650,000 displaced people.AFP images from Tawila showed displaced people, some of them with bandages, carrying their belongings and setting up temporary shelters.Around 177,000 people remain in El-Fasher, which had a population of more than one million before the war.Access routes to El-Fasher and satellite-based communications in the city remain cut off - though not for the RSF, which controls the Starlink network there.Sudan's war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and triggered the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis.Fighting exploded in the capital Khartoum but rapidly spread, where it is now estimated that at least 150,000 people have been killed, including many civilians.RSF fighters holding weapons and celebrating in the streets of El-Fasher in Sudan's DarfurScreen grab shows a gunman pointing his weapon at unarmed civilians The civil war has forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine swept parts of the country.An investigation by Amnesty International suggests that RSF rebels have waged a calculated campaign of sexual violence against defenceless civilians, using rape, murder and torture to terrorise, demoralise and subjugate the population living in areas they seized.The army, which has been fighting the RSF for two-and-a-half years, has also been accused of war crimes.The so-called Quad group - comprising the United States, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia - held talks over several months towards securing a truce.But those talks have reached an impasse, an official close to the negotiations said, with 'continued obstructionism' from the army-aligned government.While diplomats have preached peace, outside powers, including Quad members, have been accused of interfering in the conflict.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Says He&apos;s Not Planning Strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxukMPPVuPE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fxukMPPVuPE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:50:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News -

He expresses concern about the lack of a clear strategy and warns that this could open a Pandora's box, especially in relation to China. Hodges also questions Trump’s strong focus on Venezuela, viewing the military actions as potentially aimed at regime change rather than addressing drug cartels. He raises alarms about Trump's intention to deploy military troops into U.S. cities, suggesting it could challenge military leadership. Additionally, Hodges shares a grim outlook on the situation in Ukraine, believing that Russia feels increasingly confident that Europe and the U.S. may give up on supporting Ukraine.

In fact, a new report detailed that the president has been presented with a list of potential strikes inside Venezuela.The Wall Street Journal detailed that the targets are considered nexus between the Nicolas Maduro regime and drug-trafficking organizations. They include military ports and airports, as well as naval facilities and airstrips.The outlet noted that Trump hasn't made a final decision yet, but he has publicly suggested the current military campaign would go from conducting strikes against alleged drug boats in the ocean to others in land.The focus of the escalation, it added, would be to convince Maduro to step down. "The President is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our homeland," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the WSJ in a statement.Several Republican officials have been supportive of the operation, with some claiming that the regime's days are numbered. However, a growing number of GOP lawmakers are publicly demanding greater oversight of the campaign. But the administration is so confident that its military campaign is so popular that it doesn't need approval from Congress, according to another report.Concretely, a White House official told Politico this week that the strikes against the vessels in the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific fulfill a campaign promise from Donald Trump to deal with drug cartels.© 2025 Latin Times.

Donald Trump and Xi Jinping were all smiles at the APEC summit. But with India still facing the highest US tariffs, Modi avoided a chance to meet Trump at the ASEAN talks. On another front, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have literally joined forces — creating a mutual defense pact that some say could lead to an “Islamic NATO.” DW’s security podcast, Global Eyes, takes a look at these questions with India’s former foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal — and also discusses Delhi’s moves to court the Taliban — including a visit from the Afghan Taliban’s foreign minister to India and news India is re-opening its Kabul embassy. The visit came just as Pakistan and Afghanistan clashed over support to the Pakistan Taliban (the TTP). Our hosts also get input on this from former Pakistan senator, Afrasiab Khattak, who says Pakistan has been “lying to itself” about the TTP for decades. Let us know what you think about our new format in the comments.

"People will come out when the correct moment arrives, and that's been built as we speak."The comments come as the Trump administration has reportedly made the decision to strike military facilities inside Venezuela, with attacks potentially taking place at any time.The strikes seek to "decapitate the hierarchy" of the Cartel de los Soles, which U.S. officials claim is ran by top members of the Maduro regime, the Miami Herald claimed. The outlet cited officials saying they believe cartel exports amount to 500 tons of cocaine every year.Sources didn't tell the outlet whether Maduro is a target, but warned that his time is running out. "Maduro is about to find himself trapped and might soon discover that he cannot flee the country even if he decided to," one of them said."What's worse for him, there is now more than one general willing to capture and hand him over, fully aware that one thing is to talk about death, and another to see it coming."The Wall Street Journal also reported on Friday that President Donald Trump has been presented with a list of potential strikes inside Venezuela.The outlet detailed that the targets are considered nexus between the Nicolas Maduro regime and drug-trafficking organizations, including the Cartel de los Soles. They include military ports and airports, as well as naval facilities and airstrips.© 2025 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

Analysts, on average, estimated 18% growth.  Investor expectations for the cloud business were relatively low heading into Thursday’s report after the company in recent quarters cited constraints in getting new data centers online. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy and other executives had said they were optimistic about the business, though they stopped short of forecasting a reacceleration of growth. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Analyst for E-Commerce and Athleisure Poonam Goyal and Bloomberg Tech Co-Host Ed Ludlow join Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.

The huge spending reverses a long period of frugality, in which the country was limited by strict borrowing rules, enshrined in the constitution. Now Chancellor Friedrich Merz is loosening the country`s purse strings and promising swift changes. Can this policy u-turn transform Germany`s economic fortunes and what will it take to turn all this money into growth?

The practice of "nullifying" (Russian: "obnulenie") — the Russian military's term for executing its soldiers — increasingly involves sending personnel on deadly assualt missions without proper protection, journalists found. Verstka collected information on over 100 "nullifiers" among Russia's senior officers. Investigators spoke to military personnel and their families, and also studied complaints from the military prosecutor's office. One example is Colonel Igor Istrati, a commander of Russia's 114th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, who allegedly ordered executions and torture of soldiers in his unit. He reportedly sent troops on assualts without weapons or equipment in an effort to "nullify" targeted soldiers. "You know, what's happening there is that... You never know where the bullet will come from: from your own side or from the Ukrainians," said Dmitry, a member of the brigade. Russian soldiers have also been executed for refusing to participate in suicidal assaults, Verstka reported. One conscript, Alexei, described a commander ordering a subordinate to gun down any soldiers who refused to join an assault. Their bodies "were simply thrown into the river in their bulletproof vests so that they wouldn't float, or they were buried somewhere. That's the easiest way to get rid of them," he said.Others reported similar stories of soldiers being ordered at gunpoint to join "meat-grinder" assaults and being executed by their own troops if they refused. Soldiers also described torture pits — basements and grated holes where servicemembers were beaten, starved, and even drowned. In some cases, soldiers reported being forced to fight one another in the pits for the chance to live. The killings are primarily motivated by money, Verstka reported. Commanders sell the opportunity to avoid assault missions, demand bribes, and transfer salaries from contract fighters to their own accounts. Refusal to pay can result in being "nullified." Russia's ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine has relied on deadly "human wave" assaults, with Moscow incurring heavy personnel losses for every inch of territory gained. The tactic is brutal but effective: Russian forces have steadily advanced in Donetsk Oblast, taking advantage of their superior numbers to offset record casualties. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Novo Nordisk cuts 9,000 jobs, eyes Metsera&apos;s obesity shot | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZhA8mB3ans</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hZhA8mB3ans?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:17:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Novo Nordisk has nearly finished notifying employees affected by 9,000 job cuts, as it faces heated competition in the United States, the world's biggest drug market, against rival Eli Lilly.

Manželstvo bude zo zákona ukončené bez ohľadu na súhlas či názor dotknutých osôb, a to aj vtedy, ak tranzícia prebehla v zahraničí, informuje portál Aktuality.sk.Iniciatíva Inakosť kritizuje návrh, pretože ho prirovnáva k vyhláseniu manžela za mŕtveho. Minister spravodlivosti Boris Susko (Smer) predložil nový Občiansky zákonník do pripomienkového konania začiatkom októbra s cieľom modernizovať a sprístupniť naše právo, keďže súčasný zákonník pochádza z roku 1964 (z čias socializmu) a neupravoval otázky tranzície. Nový Občiansky zákonník, ktorý má platiť od roku 2027, na túto otázku myslí ale transrodovým ľuďom výrazne komplikuje život.Štát plánuje automaticky rušiť manželstvá osôb po zmene pohlavia, bez zisťovania vôle partnerov. Nový Občiansky zákonník uvádza, že „Manželstvo zanikne zmenou pohlavia manžela“ toto ustanovenie nasleduje hneď za bodom o vyhlásení manžela za mŕtveho. Zmena v praxi znamená automatický rozvod, po ktorom sa majetok a práva k deťom riešia rovnako ako po bežnom rozvode.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trick-or-treaters may bag more gummy candy than chocolate this Halloween</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OELuCv2MpQ0</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OELuCv2MpQ0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ghouls, goblins … and gummy bears.

Amazon surged 12% in premarket trading on its fastest cloud-unit growth in nearly three years, while Apple gained on a revenue beat and upbeat holiday forecast. 

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hopes to sell chips from the company's Blackwell lineup to customers in China someday. “No decisions have been made, and we’ll see how it turns out,” Huang said Friday in South Korea. The Nvidia chief said earlier this week that the company hasn’t applied for Washington’s permission to sell Blackwell chips to China, permits that are required under export controls first imposed in 2022.

The destruction was one hundred percent,” Malyuk said.“This is something we have never made public before… It happened before the name ‘Oreshnik’ was widely used.”Ukraine’s intelligence estimates that Russia has fired one Oreshnik missile and destroyed a second, with at least one still in its arsenal. As Foreign Intelligence Service head Oleh Ivashchenko noted:“There is one [launch system]… We believe that this year up to three were produced, and up to six are planned annually.”President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia may deploy the Oreshnik to Belarus, putting parts of Europe within its reach.“We understand that their approximate range is 5,500 kilometers. And there is a dead zone of 700 kilometers. This means that Europeans, especially those in Eastern Europe, should pay attention to this. And everyone else, too. We must pay attention to these risks,” he said.Russian state media has reported, without evidence, that the missile is capable of hitting any target on the European continent in under an hour and obliterating it with up to six independently maneuvering warheads each armed with an atomic munition.Russia’s first, and so far, only confirmed use of the so-called Oreshnik missile was in an attack on the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The missile is thought by Western analysts to be a modified Soviet-era Soviet RS-26 Rubezh medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). It has a claimed range in excess of 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) and carries six nuclear capable or conventional multiple independently re-targetable hypersonic re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).Earlier today Russia’s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu reportedly urged skeptics to “believe” in the development and successful testing of Moscow’s new “miracle weapons” – the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear torpedo.Speaking at the Peoples of Russia and the CIS forum, Shoigu reminded the audience that President Vladimir Putin first announced the creation of these weapons during his 2018 address to the Federal Assembly.“Maybe someone didn’t believe it then, but now they will have to,” Shoigu said.On Oct. 26, Putin announced the completion of the “final tests” of the intercontinental Burevestnik cruise missile, describing it as having “no analogues in the world.”Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov added that during its test flight, the missile, equipped with a nuclear propulsion system, traveled 14,000 kilometers and remained airborne for about 15 hours.He said the missile’s technical features “allow it to strike highly protected targets at any distance with guaranteed precision.” Putin, in turn, ordered preparations for the missile’s deployment infrastructure within Russia’s armed forces.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;There&apos;s more to come&quot; says royal commentator about Andrew and Epstein files</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NJdQfQYC7iE</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NJdQfQYC7iE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:51:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Royal commentator Afua Hagan says King Charles stripping his younger brother Andrew of his title of prince and forcing him out of his Windsor home is "significant," but that the royal family took this step because she believes "there's absolutely more to come" from the Epstein files.

According to Ofcom, visits to pornography sites in general in the UK have reduced by almost a third in the three months since 25 July.The regulator said the new law was fulfilling its primary purpose of stopping children from being able to "easily stumble across porn without searching for it"."Our new rules end the era of an age-blind internet, when many sites and apps have undertaken no meaningful checks to see if children were using their services," the watchdog said.Ofcom told the BBC it believed the number of people using VPNs for general use reached 1.5 million daily in July, after the law came in, but has since decreased to around one million.Meanwhile, research by Cybernews counted more than 10.7 million downloads of VPN apps in the UK from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store across 2025."It is likely that people not wanting to verify their age or identity to access sexual content, for example because of privacy concerns, are using VPNs to get around this," Dr Hanne Stegeman from the University of Exeter told the BBC. "As the location of website visitors are usually determined through IP addresses, it could be that those figures are inaccurate when a portion of visitors are using VPNs."And Cybernews information security researcher Aras Nazarovas told the BBC people in the UK "can and do" use VPNs. "After age checks kicked in, VPN apps jumped to the top of the UK App Store, and at least one provider saw a 1,800% surge in downloads," he said."So part of Pornhub's 'missing' UK audience hasn't vanished - it's being reclassified as non‑UK traffic."But he said he believed "the rest" was indeed "users shifting to sites that don't require age checks".Age verification 'insurmountable task' - Pornhub execAlex Kekesi, an executive at Pornhub's parent company Aylo, told the BBC the new rules were unenforceable.She said Ofcom faced an "insurmountable task" trying to get an estimated 240,000 adult platforms - visited by eight million users per month in the UK - to follow the rules.This compares with the regulator taking action against fewer than 70 sites for non-compliance.Ofcom says it prioritises sites to be investigated based on how risky they are and their number of users.And Ms Kekesi claimed some pornographic sites have benefited from flouting the rules. The BBC has not independently verified this."There are a number of sites whose traffic has grown exponentially, and these are sites that are not complying," she said.Ms Kekesi also has concerns about the content on some of these sites.She told the BBC of one which seemed to encourage users to search for content featuring girls below the age of consent.Aylo says it has shared details of this and other sites with Ofcom.The regulator has defended the way it enforces the new rules, saying increasing traffic to sites can be one factor that triggers an investigation."Sites that don't comply and put children at risk can expect to face enforcement action," it told BBC News.Ofcom's data shows that the top 10 most popular sites all have age assurance deployed. These sites represent a quarter of all visits to adult sites from across the UK.It adds that over three quarters of daily traffic to the top 100 most popular sites are going to sites that have age assurance.The government has also defended the regulator, and said protecting children online was a "top priority" for ministers."Where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children, we will not hesitate to act," it added in a statement.Should devices do the checks?Ms Kekesi spoke to the BBC while in the UK for a meeting with Ofcom and government officials, where she has been making Pornhub's case that age checks should be done at device level, rather than by individual websites.She said the UK stands out in having persuaded the platform to introduce age checks.A number of jurisdictions have sought to compel Pornhub to check its users' ages, but the response of the site has been to block users rather than comply.Ms Kekesi said the UK was different because it allowed sites to offer a range of different solutions, meaning that Pornhub could use methods - such as email-based checks - which didn't require collecting biometric data.She denied that the threat of hefty fines for non-compliance had been the primary motive for complying, pointing to the contrast with France - its second biggest market - where it had cut off access rather than agreeing to what regulators demanded.Ian Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association rejected calls for a switch to device-based verification.But he added the group shared a desire for a "level playing field" meaning age checks should be "robust, not superficial or fake". Chelsea Jarvie, a cybersecurity company founder who has been researching methods of age assurance for a PhD at Strathclyde University, told the BBC both approaches to age checks would be needed - with neither age verification on platforms nor devices being a "silver bullet"."For somebody to truly be safe online we need different layers of controls throughout their browsing journey," she said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What to know about where things stand with the war in Sudan</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5xS16Bgfeo4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5xS16Bgfeo4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:46:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sudan’s brutal two-year war has entered a new, dangerous phase.

All countries develop their defense systems—that’s not the same as nuclear testing.”Peskov reiterated several times that the Burevestnik and Poseidon tests—both hyped by Putin as “unparalleled” weapons—did not involve nuclear detonations. He added that Moscow would only reconsider its stance if another country abandoned the testing moratorium.“President Putin has repeatedly stated: of course, if someone departs from the moratorium, Russia will act accordingly,” Peskov said.When asked whether Moscow saw itself in a new arms race with Washington, he dismissed the idea. “I wouldn’t put it that way,” Peskov said.His remarks came days after Donald Trump ordered the Pentagon to immediately resume US nuclear testing, citing Russia’s reported trials of the Burevestnik and Poseidon.Putin had earlier described both systems as “next-generation strategic weapons”—one a nuclear-powered cruise missile, the other an autonomous nuclear torpedo—before the Kremlin suddenly rebranded the tests as non-nuclear after Washington’s reaction.Earlier, Norway’s Vice Admiral Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway’s Intelligence Service, confirmed that Russia tested its nuclear-powered Burevestnik long-range cruise missile last week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: APEC Leaders&apos; welcome dinner in South Korea</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7DQ2z_z7A</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Cg7DQ2z_z7A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:02:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Leaders from the Asia Pacific region gather for a welcome dinner in South Korea.

Governor Mikhail Evraev confirmed that an attack had taken place but claimed there were no casualties. Airspace over Yaroslavl’s Tunoshna airport was temporarily restricted, according to Rosaviatsia.A more serious strike occurred in the city of Orel, where drones hit a local thermal power plant (TPP), damaging power supply equipment, according to regional governor Andrey Klychkov.He said there were “no injuries or fires” but confirmed that parts of the city were left without heat and hot water.“Repair crews are working to eliminate a number of damages to the main pipeline,” Klychkov said, adding that the supply restrictions affected three of the city’s four districts. “There is no need to panic; the situation is under control.”CCTV footage published by Astra appeared to show two impacts at the Orel TPP, one of which hit the facility’s open switchgear that distributes electricity from the plant to the grid.The Orel TPP is the largest power generation source in the region, and with night temperatures hovering around 5-6°C, the outage poses serious challenges for residents.The Russian Defense Ministry claimed that 130 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones were “intercepted and destroyed” overnight, including nine over Orel and five over Yaroslavl, but made no mention of the strike in Vladimir.The Ukrainian side has not commented on the reported attacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Taiwan commissions new US-made Abrams tanks as President Lai vows to strengthen defense</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIhX0OkfVWY</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TIhX0OkfVWY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 09:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Taiwan’s army commissioned a new fleet of US-made Abrams M1A2T tanks on Friday in a ceremony attended by President Lai Ching-te, marking a significant step in the island’s ongoing effort to modernize its military amid rising tensions with China.

On today's show, Nasdaq futures surged more than 1% after earnings drove a postmarket rally in Apple and Amazon. Apple forecast a blockbuster holiday season, while Amazon’s cloud unit delivered the strongest growth in almost three years. Meanwhile, Nvidia forged a landmark AI deal to supply its technology to Samsung, Hyundai Motor and SK.

Chinese president Xi Jinping warns against breaking supply chains in his first public remarks after his pivotal meeting with US counterpart Donald Trump. His speech comes on the closing day of the APEC summit and a day after securing a one-year truce in the world's biggest trade fight.

Buckingham Palace says King Charles has stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and is evicting him from his royal residence.
The rare move comes after weeks of pressure to act over Andrew's relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Before qualifying for the Rafale in 2020, Shivangi Singh flew the MiG-21 Bison. Her progression from one of the world's oldest fighter aircraft to one of its most advanced represents the changing face of India's air combat leadership.Recently, Singh was felicitated by Air Marshal Tejbir Singh, SASO of the IAF Training Command, at the Flying Instructors School in Tamil Nadu's Tambaram. The felicitation was for earning her Qualified Flying Instructor (QFI) badge on October 9, 2025.Another doctored video also circulated online, falsely showing IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh claiming that Shivangi Singh was missing and that he had visited her family. The government promptly debunked the claim, with PIB Fact Check terming the video as "baseless and fabricated".PRESIDENT'S HISTORIC SORTIEIn a historic first, President Murmu took a sortie in a Rafale fighter jet from the Air Force Station in Haryana's Ambala -- an experience she called 'unforgettable'. Air Chief Marshal AP Singh flew in a separate aircraft from the same base.President Droupadi Murmu poses for pictures before she takes a sortie in a Rafale fighter jet at Air Force Station in Haryana's Ambala. (Photo: PTI)With this flight, Murmu became the first Indian President to have flown in two fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force. In April 2023, she had undertaken a sortie in a Sukhoi-30 MKI from the Tezpur Air Force Station in Assam.President Droupadi Murmu made her maiden sortie in a Sukhoi-30 MKI fighter aircraft at Assam’s Tezpur Air Force Station in April 2023. (Photo: PTI)In a note written in the visitors' book after the sortie, the President said she was 'delighted' to visit Ambala for her maiden Rafale flight. "This first flight on the potent Rafale aircraft has instilled in me a renewed sense of pride in the nation's defence capabilities. I congratulate the Indian Air Force and the entire team of Air Force Station Ambala for organising this sortie successfully," Murmu wrote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Xi Calls for Stable Supply Chains At APEC Summit | The China Show 10/31/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vawG1-DpqFw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vawG1-DpqFw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:10:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Bloomberg: The China Show” is your definitive source for news and analysis on the world's second-biggest economy.

A hand-drawn portrait of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un can be seen on the wall above their bed, in this photo provided by a North Korean defectors' activist group on Oct. 30. [YONHAP]   Two North Korean prisoners of war in Ukraine, captured while fighting for Russia and detained since early 2025, have pleaded with a visiting documentary producer to bring them to South Korea, an activist said Friday.      Jang Se-yul, head of a North Korean defectors' group in South Korea, disclosed the meeting between two North Korean captives in their 20s and a South Korean documentary producer Tuesday at a prisoner camp near Kyiv, Ukraine, where they are currently held.      The North Korean soldiers first came to media attention when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote online in January that they had been captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia's western Kursk region while in battle.      "Please bring [us] to South Korea," Jang quoted them as telling the producer, weeping.      Both of them expressed a desire to go to South Korea, Jang suggested, a change from February, when only one of them had expressed such an intent during a meeting with South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon.     The soldier had expressed a desire to have a home and start a family in the South, according to Yu. Sending the soldiers back to the North would be a "death sentence," the lawmaker said.      Provided photos showed that the jaw wound sustained by one of them at the time of capture was now healed, though it had left some bone distortion. Otherwise, they appeared to be in a relatively healthy state.      Hand-drawn portraits of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were hung on the bed of one of them.  A North Korean prisoner of war meets with producer Kim Young-mi at a prisoner camp in Ukraine on Oct. 28 in this photo provided by an activist group on Oct. 30. [YONHAP]    They asked for medicine for eye diseases, knitted clothes, trousers, cigarettes, pens and books via the producer, Jang said, also conveying Ukrainian officials' remarks that they were in a state of psychological instability and had attempted to harm themselves.     South Korea has notified the Ukrainian government of its intent to receive the North Korean captives if their intentions were confirmed, but no progress appears to be underway on their transfer.      North Korea has deployed 15,000 troops to fight alongside Russia in its war with Ukraine since October last year, as the two states forge increasingly close military ties.     Some 600 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been killed while fighting for Russia, and more than 4,000 North Korean troops have also been injured, according to South Korea's spy agency.     Kim has touted the troops as "heroes" who were assigned to carry out the "most important duty."

                Displaced Sudanese who fled el-Fasher after the city fell to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), arrive in the town of Tawila war-torn Sudan's western Darfur region on October 28, 2025.
                JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — For months doctors at the last functioning hospital in the wartorn Sudanese city of el-Fasher performed operations by torchlight, desperately trying to save lives in the most impossible conditions.The Saudi Maternity Hospital was a last refuge for the sick and injured in the besieged city, as fighting raged around them. Despite no electricity, shortages of supplies, and frequently coming under heavy shelling, medical staff kept going."They are heroes, honestly," said Dr Mohamed Faisal Elsheikh, a Sudanese medical doctor based in Manchester and a spokesperson for the Sudan Doctors Network."They really work in a very difficult environment, they had no medical instruments, there's no any medicines over there, there's no electricity…and yet with all dedication and commitment…they saved as much as they could of people's lives."No longer. Since the city fell to the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday, the doctors have been kidnapped and reports have emerged of a massacre at the hospital."On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted," from the hospital, the World Health Organization said in a statement Wednesday. "On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital."WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply shocked" and "appalled" by the massacre and called for health facilities, health workers and patients to be protected under international law."Prior to this latest attack, WHO has verified 185 attacks on health care in Sudan with 1204 deaths and 416 injuries of health workers and patients since the start of the conflict in April 2023," he said.

                Videos of the attack believed to have been filmed by RSF fighters themselves are circulating online. While they cannot be independently verified by NPR, they show militia men walking through the ransacked wards, stepping over piles of dead bodies and shooting anyone left alive at point blank range.RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has pledged to investigate the allegations of war crimes by his soldiers in el-Fasher - but many doubt his sincerity, as he has failed to investigate previous atrocities.Since overtaking el-Fasher– which they had besieged for over 500 days – and chasing out the Sudanese army, videos, satellite imagery, and testimony from those who've managed to flee indicate the RSF has been pursuing a scorched earth policy in the Darfuri city.The RSF has been fighting the national army for control of the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, and the Red Sea in a bloody civil war since 2023.The group emerged from the janjaweed militia that terrorized Darfur in the early 2000s and was accused of genocide. The US has already accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of committing genocide against African ethnic groups in the current conflict.The situation in el-Fasher was dire even before the RSF overran it this week. The year and a half long blockade of some 250,000 civilians has led to starvation and famine.The UN's migration organization says 26,000 people have managed to flee since the takeover. Many of those are arriving seeking help in the town of Tawila, in north Darfur, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders is running the closest health point.Doctors Without Borders used to provide support to the Saudi hospital but stopped operating in el-Fasher in August 2024 saying it had become too dangerous.On Wednesday the NGO said people arriving at Tawila were showing "extremely alarming levels of malnutrition among women and children, which is indicative of a famine-like situation."The organization's International president Dr Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim noted however, that very few adult men were arriving, and said this raised concerns about ethnically targeted violence."This is testament to the horror unfolding in and around the city," he said.One mother of six, who had fled el-Fasher but didn't wish to be named to protect her identity, told aid workers from international NGO Save the Children what they had endured."We hid the children in trenches, and we ran into abandoned buildings during the attacks. After that, we just ate umbaz (animal feed)," she said.Another woman described the long trek to safety, during which she was beaten and robbed by a gang."We lost family members, we lost neighbors, we lost everyone," she recounted. "We've been walking for the past four days from el-Fasher. A group of motorbike riders met us on the way…They killed people and insulted us a lot."The UN Security Council held a meeting on the crisis Thursday.The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said the violence recalls the horrors of the genocide in Darfur two decades ago."But what is different today, we are seeing a different global reaction. One of resignation," he said. "So this is also a crisis of apathy."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jamaicans scramble for basic items after direct hit from Hurricane Melissa</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaheLfIasdA</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xaheLfIasdA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 02:46:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Residents of Black River in Western Jamaica were scrambling to find basic items on Thursday, after the eye of Hurricane Melissa crossed their town during it's landfall.
