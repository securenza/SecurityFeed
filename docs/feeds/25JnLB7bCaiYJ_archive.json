Both companies have responded. But the space agency is also asking the broader commercial space industry to detail how they might get the job done more quickly, hinting that NASA leadership is prepared to sideline its current partners. CNN spoke with half a dozen companies about how they plan to respond to NASA's call to action, which the agency will formally issue once the government shutdown ends, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n\nOne possibility is Lockheed Martin...\n\n\nNotably, as a legacy NASA contractor, the company built the $20.4 billion Orion spacecraft that astronauts will ride when they take off from Earth... Now, Lockheed says it can piece together a two-stage lunar lander that uses spare parts harvested from Orion. The company would make use of Space Shuttle-era OMS-E engines — which are also used on Orion — to serve as the propulsion for an \"ascent stage\" of the lunar lander, providing the thrust for the vehicle to lift off the moon after a mission is completed. But the vehicle also needs a descent stage to get down to the lunar surface in the first place... \n\nOther commercial space companies contacted by CNN — including Firefly Aerospace and Northrop Grumman — said simply that they were \"ready to support\" NASA in its endeavor to find a faster way to complete the Artemis III mission. They did not confirm whether they would formally respond to the space agency's anticipated request for companies to submit proposals. \n\nThe more important goal, argue some experts, is to pave the way for a permanent lunar base where astronauts can live and work...\n\n[P]erhaps the true winner will be the country that is able to build lasting infrastructure, experts say.\n\"It makes great press fodder to frame this as competition,\" said one space policy source, who was among several that spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss controversial issues. \"But this is about the long game and the sustainability.\"\n","contentLength":2287,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GodLoader Malware Loader: What You Need to Be Aware of","url":"https://hackernoon.com/godloader-malware-loader-what-you-need-to-be-aware-of?source=rss","date":1762023609,"author":"Godot Engine (Technical Documentation)","guid":103330,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Security researchers at <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/\">Check Point Research</a> have <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/gaming-engines-an-undetected-playground-for-malware-loaders/\">published a report</a> about GodLoader, a malware loader using Godot as its runtime to execute malicious code and infect unaware users with known malware.

That discovery in 2006 now appears to have overturned decades of dinosaur dogma about Tyrannosaurus rex, the fearsome giant long thought to be the sole top predator stalking the late Cretaceous. In a paper in the journal Nature, paleontologists Lindsay Zanno and James Napoli conclude that some of the bones from that specimen belong not to a teenage T. rex, but to a fully grown individual of a different tyrannosaur species — Nanotyrannus lancensis.... \n\n\nOne of the first of those red flags in the new specimen was the arm bones. They looked completely different than T. rex's puny appendages... \"These are powerful arms with large claws, large hands. They were using them for prey capture.\" Contrast that with T. rex, \"an animal that's a mouth on legs.\" There were additional clues. The animal had fewer tail vertebrae and more teeth than T. rex. Zanno and Napoli considered other lines of evidence. They created 3D models of numerous purported T. rexes against which they compared their specimen. They looked at the growth stages of the cranial nerves and sinuses of close living relatives of dinosaurs, features that were visible in the fossilized skeleton. \n\n\"But maybe the most important and damning thing that we did was we were able to figure out that our animal is not a juvenile at all,\" she says. This conclusion was based on slicing through the fossil's limb bones to examine the growth rings. That work demonstrated that this animal was mature and done growing when it died around the age of 20. \"That means it's half the size and a tenth of the mass of a full grown Tyrannosaurus rex,\" says Zanno... In addition, while making models of all those other alleged T. rex skeletons, Zanno says they identified another new species of tyrannosaur, one they're calling Nanotyrannus lethaeus... \n\n\"It tells us that these end-Cretaceous ecosystems right before the asteroid hit were flourishing,\" says Zanno. \"They had an abundance of different predators. And refutes this idea that dinosaurs were in decline before the asteroid struck.\"\n\n","contentLength":2275,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ubuntu Will Use Rust For Dozens of Core Linux Utilities","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/079206/ubuntu-will-use-rust-for-dozens-of-core-linux-utilities?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762018440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":103286,"unread":true,"content":" Ubuntu \"is adopting the memory-safe Rust language,\" reports ZDNet, citing remarks at this year's Ubuntu Summit from Jon Seager, Canonical's VP of engineering for Ubuntu:\n\n.

He stressed that resilience and memory safety, not just performance, are the principal drivers: \"It's the enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust ports that are most attractive to me\". This move is echoed in Ubuntu's adoption of sudo-rs, the Rust implementation of sudo, with fallback and opt-out mechanisms for users who want to use the old-school sudo command. \n\n\nIn addition to sudo-rs, Ubuntu 26.04 will use the Rust-based uutils/coreutils for Linux's default core utilities.

And I’m here to talk about how it’s kind of your fault that the internet sucks. But also it isn’t your fault at all, and you should probably be nicer to yourself about it.</p><p>\\\nBack in 2021, when Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039\">leaked</a> a trove of the tech giant’s internal documents, much of the focus was on how the company’s products could be harmful to mental health—especially for young people. Instagram, the documents showed, had a tendency to make teen girls feel <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline\">worse</a> about their bodies. A 2018 shift in Facebook’s algorithm intended to strengthen social bonds instead <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline\">stoked</a> users’ rage. And an internal report found that one in eight users <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681?mod=article_inline\">reported</a> having an unhealthy relationship with the platform.</p><p>\\\nThe reports sparked a public firestorm, not to mention <a href=\"https://time.com/6104070/facebook-whistleblower-congressional-hearing-takeaways/\">congressional hearings</a>, but for Whitney Phillips and Ryan Milner, Haugen’s smuggled documents confirmed what their years of research had already showed definitively: the online world can be a real drag.</p><p>\\\nPhillips and Milner—who teach media literacy at University of Oregon and College of Charleston, respectively—have spent their academic careers looking at toxic effects of online culture in books like  and . They began by looking at online enclaves infamous for digital pollution, like troll communities that delight in spreading toxic mischief far and wide. But they’ve come to see many of the bad feelings engendered by social media as algorithmically-intensified versions of the same set of anxieties that have plagued humanity since before two computers first traded data packets.</p><p>\\\nEveryone who uses the internet has, at some point, probably done something crummy and been the victim of someone else doing something crummy. It’s the circle of posts and it moves us all. But, luckily, interrupting this cycle is possible—if you use the internet a little more slowly, a little more mindfully.</p><p>\\\nI spoke with Phillips and Milner about how people can better regulate their emotions while scrolling, and to know when to pause, take a breath, and not get drawn into an online flame war that will only serve to make life worse for everyone involved.</p><p>\\\n<em>The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p> One of the things I liked about <em>Share Better and Stress Less</em> is that even though it’s framed in a simple and straightforward way that young people can understand, a lot of this advice is fairly universal for anyone trying to stay sane while using the internet. What prompted you to write the book?</p><p>\\\n My own experience with this conversation about mental health and the role it plays in how we’re sharing and what our online spaces look like, a lot of that was really crystallized as COVID ramped up.</p><p>\\\nAs that was happening, more of the conversations [among students in my media literacy class] were shifting to mental health. In part, because the world was getting increasingly more stressful, both politically and then also COVID. And that, of course, became political very quickly</p><p>\\\nIn the classroom, the more I saw my students struggling, the more they were admitting to sharing in ways they recognized as being problematic. Students were starting to hear that maybe the university would be shut down. They’d be like, “All I’m doing is sharing rumors. I know most of them are probably false. I know that it’s probably bad that I’m doing it. But it makes me feel like I’m doing something and I cannot help it.”</p><p>\\\nThey were trying to process information and hitting retweet, or whatever platform they were on, that was part of their process of coping.</p><p>\\\n So much of the book is about regulating your own emotions, work that’s happening on this side of the screen, happening inside of your head. It’s thinking about your own relationship to social media as you are using social media and putting thoughtfulness into your moment-to-moment experience.</p><p>\\\n A lot of that is not just your relationship to social media, it’s your relationship to yourself. How well are you able to identify what is happening in your body? People were not talking about embodied experiences when they were talking about the problem of mis- and dis-information. But those issues are intimately connected.</p><p>\\\nWe all know what it feels like to be stressed out. That’s not something that’s talked about in a systematic way. This isn’t just about social media. This is about meat, our bones and our nervous system. Where has that been in this conversation about media literacy?</p><p>\\\n As we went along in our research, we started thinking and talking more about the cognitive and psychological elements. It was happening in our classroom conversations, for sure, but it was also happening in my own life.</p><p>\\\nDuring lockdown, when we were remote teaching, I would teach my couple classes in the morning and then during the afternoon, I wouldn’t have a ton to do. So I’d just melt into the couch and scroll through Twitter.</p><p>\\\nWe use one example in the book of me scrolling through Twitter, seeing a video, overreacting to it, sending it to my brother, freaking out about it, and having to stop, fact check it, and then walk it all back. If, in the moment, I had stopped and said, “Where am I at? How am I doing? What am I doing? Is this the best for me right now?” If I would have had that moment of slowness and self-reflection, it would have done me a lot of good.</p><p>\\\n Can you walk me through that feedback loop? Using the internet and coming across content that triggers you in a way that creates behaviors that, when you look back at them, you’re like, “I was not my best self in that moment.”</p><p>\\\n I’m not a neuroscientist. So I’m not going to I’m not going to claim that level of expertise. But in reading and listening to people who are experts, a good way of looking at your brain is as a closed fist. The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, is where all of your higher-level decision-making takes place. It’s what allows you to distinguish between real threats and imagined threats. Some scientists refer to it as the upstairs brain.</p><p>\\\nThe downstairs part of the brain is where you have a lizard functioning. That’s the fight/flight/freeze, the limbic system. That’s what gets activated, what lights up when something overloads your system and you suddenly get overwhelmed, get scared, get angry.</p><p>\\\nThe best way to think about it is that essentially you flip your lid—your prefrontal cortex becomes dislodged from the bottom part of your brain. You’re no longer able to do all of that really important higher-order functioning that that can help you identify, “that’s not actually a threat to me right now,” or “I can try to see where someone else is coming from,” or “I’m going to do something that’s going to help me take care of myself.”</p><p>\\\nAll of those really important skills literally go offline. One of the things that activates the limbic system is when you get overwhelmed by too much information. Too much is coming at you. It’s too scary. It’s confusing. Once you lose that, the ability to have thoughtful communication goes out the door. Your ability to take care of yourself in appropriate ways goes out the door. Your ability to think about other people as people goes out the door.</p><p>\\\nAll of those things are what push people into the screaming matches, to share things that under different circumstances when their lid was not flipped, they would maybe think twice about. We just don’t have the ability to be our most thoughtful, generous, flexible selves when we move into this space of stress.</p><p>\\\nOnline spaces, because they’re designed to inundate us with information, are designed to inundate us with stress. Online spaces are just not conducive to this kind of thinking. That’s a problem because this kind of thinking is actually how we have important, difficult, challenging, thoughtful communication with other people. A lot goes wrong when you flip your lid and it just so happens the spaces we spend the most time in are designed to make it very difficult to keep your lid screwed on tight.</p><p>\\\n When thinking of a younger audience, I think it’s even more of an important lesson, even more important to remember. Because, as we know, the upstairs brain isn’t fully developed. The prefrontal cortex isn’t as fully there. Young people in general are more inclined to shortsighted thinking, impulsiveness, and all the stereotypes about teenagers.</p><p>\\\nIt really becomes this perfect storm where you have people who haven’t thought about the stuff as much yet, their brain isn’t quite there. And then you’ve got, like Whitney was just saying, an ecosystem designed to feed on those kinds of impulses.</p><p>\\\n How would someone develop a practice that would allow them to disrupt this mechanism?</p><p>\\\n These days, when I have conversations about technology, almost immediately, the conversation stops being about technology. A lot of what drives anxious behavior is fear of rejection. It’s feeling like you don’t have something that you need.</p><p>\\\nWhen people say, what should we do about these problems with technology? My short answer, and I’m not really being glib, is: everybody should be in therapy. But then, also recognizing that not everyone can go to therapy, not everyone has access to therapy.</p><p>\\\nBut if you can’t, for whatever reason, how can you shift that relationship with yourself so that you are listening in a more compassionate way? Oftentimes when people get really frazzled and angry, they think what they’re feeling is anger and they’re actually wrong. It’s something else. It’s something that’s softer. We don’t always know how to talk to that part of ourselves and particularly how it manifests in our body.</p><p>\\\nThe need for connection and the anxiety that emerges when we don’t get what we need as humans, as social beings. That isn’t new. That’s been around forever. But the technology has really shifted some of the dynamics and intensified a lot of the things that have already existed. they create more screens that people aren’t responding to us on.</p><p>\\\nI think it’s really important for people to think about some of the negative or potentially negative consequences of technologies. But also getting so focused on just the technologies themselves takes away both the embodied conversation and takes away from the fact that being a person is hard. It’s just really hard. Being an adult is really hard. Being a kid is really hard. We never fully figure things out. And every time we get a little older and get a little bit more mature, we realize other areas where there’s still a lot to learn.</p><p>\\\n You make this argument in your book that everyone is in some way responsible for online pollution. If you exist online, you are going to do things from time to time that make the internet a slightly worse place. That really shifts the dynamic of the conversation, which I think is largely focused around the idea that the really toxic trolls, the apex predators of internet toxicity, are the problem.</p><p>\\\n The initial assumption that a lot of people would make going into a social media how-to guide for middle schoolers would be more about how to protect yourself from cyber bullies, from catfishes, from predators. How to put on your armor and put up your defenses. Ways that you can shelter yourself and insulate yourself from the big bad world out there.</p><p>\\\nBut I think young people hear a lot of that and, in my experience having three kids, they get a lot of that. A lot of that is pretty intuitive after a little bit of conversation. When you’re gaming online, don’t give out your personal information. Don’t add random people on Snapchat.</p><p>\\\nThe mentality is not one of pointing a finger, not one of saying “you’re messing this up” or “you’re doing this wrong” or “you’re being mean.” But instead, even if you think you’re right, think about the unintended consequences of being a person online.</p><p>\\\nWe all know the story of how social media platforms get their money. The problem is that those ways to get money are very often directly at odds with what we need to be our best selves in these places. They’re at odds with being slow or being mindful. They reward that lizard brain sharing. They reward the anger. They reward the outrageous and sensational. There’s all kinds of tricks and schemes to get you to keep refreshing, keep scrolling.</p><p>\\\nThe norms of social media now—the algorithmic docency, the slot machine dynamics, the reward for sharing and consuming outrage—none of those align well with the practices, mediated or otherwise, that get us to a less stressed kind of place.</p><p>\\\n It’s important to get people to reflect on the less obvious parts of this conversation.

Now, these aren’t “caused” by AI; I’m not referring to hoaxes that people have used AI specifically to spread, but things that AI has made worse by the ease with which fake information can be made to look very, very real.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, this problem existed, but in my opinion, was severely muted. The concept of biased news is not new by any means and has been an issue for as long as the news has existed. There have always been audiences that are more susceptible to believing in these invented stories, scenarios, and scams, and the media has always catered to them, guiding them to the water they wish them to drink. </p><p>\\\nMy concern, and reason for this brain dump, is that with AI, these evil parties seem to be able to cast a much wider net than they could before. They can twist real news into something it’s not with fake videos made by AI; they can pump the internet full of AI-generated content that says whatever they want and cites other AI-generated sources, and they can mobilize an army of influencers that spread their filth like wildfire in an instant.</p><p>\\\nI’ve found that recently, a huge chunk of my time when consuming any form of media is spent asking, “Is this real?” I consistently have to find multiple sources and manually scan them, looking for clues that it was AI-generated, a task that is getting harder and harder by the week. The videos are getting more realistic, the content is written better, and the sources I'm used to relying on are less and less trustworthy.</p><p>A group of protestors (in this case, trolls) showed up at Chicago’s Bean with claims that there was a man trapped inside. The protestors claimed that they had found evidence that a wealth of life-support systems had been purchased during the making of the Bean statue, and also attempted to make a connection to a potential missing person (a baby, I believe) around the time of its construction. Trolls exist. They always have and always will. That’s not the issue at hand here. The issue is what happened next. This group was clearly trying to be funny, just causing a stir with some radical idea for their own amusement, but the internet used AI to take the country by storm.</p><p>\\\nWhile scrolling, I started to see dozens of videos with screenshots of these purchase records, x-ray footage of a person floating inside the Bean, and “eyewitness” reports from someone who claimed they could hear knocking or scratching coming from inside the structure. There were also videos of the Bean being constructed, where you could clearly see the equipment being placed inside. Most, if not all, of these were generated by AI and are completely fake. I knew this, being a sensible human, but I had to admit that the quality created compelling evidence. With less common sense, I would have been easily duped.</p><p>The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS has been a goldmine for AI generators and the conspiracy-loving masses. From what I could find, which wasn’t much because it seems a lot of this information is being controlled to stop the spread of disinformation, all we know is that a comet is passing through our solar system. This comet looks like a comet and acts like a comet, but is slightly faster and is not orbiting our sun. One scientist ventured a challenge to the “it’s just a comet” consensus to encourage more critical thinking, theorizing that it was, of course, possible for it to be an alien craft. This set the AI-loving conspiracy nuts on fire.</p><p>\\\nMy Instagram feed was on absolute fire with fake videos of this comet with lights being emitted from the sides like a ship, with exhaust clearly venting into space, and fake X-ray shots that showed the internal ship structure and beings inside. Countless videos of influencers pretended to be experts on the matter and talked about potential alien invasions. The worst part of all of this was that each one cited different sources and pulled from different video content. It was easy to assume that a “potential alien invasion” was fake; however, I have to admit, the video content they provided was stunningly believable. The “experts” talking were confident and had plenty of “research” to back them up.</p><p>\\\nThe most alarming thing about this entire situation is how fast this misinformation is able to spread and how absolutely believable it can make it. I know this isn’t a controlled situation, and we’ve always had irresponsible people running social media accounts to susceptible individuals, but the use of AI in these fields is making the problem more abundant and harder to discern.</p><h2><strong>It’s not all bad… but it’s pretty bad.</strong></h2><p>AI is a wonderful tool that has the potential to make our lives easier. I don’t believe that it is ready for constant use yet, despite it being shoved down our throats around every turn. It consistently hallucinates and makes false claims; it slows my work down more than it speeds it up, and has become a barrier to productivity in most situations I’ve tried to use it. </p><p>\\\nHowever, I can admit it has potential, and there are small automation tasks that I do find small uses for it. That being said, there’s always going to be a heated conversation around ethics and how we should be using AI. </p><p>\\\nI don’t believe there will be any disagreement, however, that the above cases are the wrong way to use AI. The use of AI to generate content to fuel conspiracy theories and spread them to the masses as facts is dangerous and, frankly, terrifying. I believe we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and I worry that we’re headed for a future where we’ll no longer be able to discern the difference between truth and fiction.</p>","contentLength":5778,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Security Holes Found in OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas Browser (and Perplexity's Comet)","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/054213/security-holes-found-in-openais-chatgpt-atlas-browser-and-perplexitys-comet?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762011240,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":103257,"unread":true,"content":"The address bar/ChatGPT input window in OpenAI's browser ChatGPT Atlas \"could be targeted for prompt injection using malicious instructions disguised as links,\" reports SC World, citing a report from AI/agent security platform NeuralTrust:\n\nNeuralTrust found that a malformed URL could be crafted to include a prompt that is treated as plain text by the browser, passing the prompt on to the LLM. A malformation, such as an extra space after the first slash following \"https:\" prevents the browser from recognizing the link as a website to visit. Rather than triggering a web search, as is common when plain text is submitted to a browser's address bar, ChatGPT Atlas treats plain text as ChatGPT prompts by default. \n\nAn unsuspecting user could potentially be tricked into copying and pasting a malformed link, believing they will be sent to a legitimate webpage. An attacker could plant the link behind a \"copy link\" button so that the user might not notice the suspicious text at the end of the link until after it is pasted and submitted. These prompt injections could potentially be used to instruct ChatGPT to open a new tab to a malicious website such as a phishing site, or to tell ChatGPT to take harmful actions in the user's integrated applications or logged-in sites like Google Drive, NeuralTrust said. \n\nLast month browser security platform LayerX also described how malicious prompts could be hidden in URLs (as a parameter) for Perplexity's browser Comet. And last week SquareX Labs demonstrated that a malicious browser extension could spoof Comet's AI sidebar feature and have since replicated the proof-of-concept (PoC) attack on Atlas. \n\n\n\nBut another new vulnerability in ChatGPT Atlas \"could allow malicious actors to inject nefarious instructions into the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered assistant's memory and run arbitrary code,\" reports The Hacker News, citing a report from browser security platform LayerX:\n\n\n\n\"This exploit can allow attackers to infect systems with malicious code, grant themselves access privileges, or deploy malware,\" LayerX Security Co-Founder and CEO, Or Eshed, said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The attack, at its core, leverages a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw that could be exploited to inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT's persistent memory. The corrupted memory can then persist across devices and sessions, permitting an attacker to conduct various actions, including seizing control of a user's account, browser, or connected systems, when a logged-in user attempts to use ChatGPT for legitimate purposes.... \n\n\"What makes this exploit uniquely dangerous is that it targets the AI's persistent memory, not just the browser session,\" Michelle Levy, head of security research at LayerX Security, said. \"By chaining a standard CSRF to a memory write, an attacker can invisibly plant instructions that survive across devices, sessions, and even different browsers. In our tests, once ChatGPT's memory was tainted, subsequent 'normal' prompts could trigger code fetches, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration without tripping meaningful safeguards....\" \n\n\nLayerX said the problem is exacerbated by ChatGPT Atlas' lack of robust anti-phishing controls, the browser security company said, adding it leaves users up to 90% more exposed than traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. In tests against over 100 in-the-wild web vulnerabilities and phishing attacks, Edge managed to stop 53% of them, followed by Google Chrome at 47% and Dia at 46%. In contrast, Perplexity's Comet and ChatGPT Atlas stopped only 7% and 5.8% of malicious web pages. \n\nFrom The Conversation:\n\nSandboxing is a security approach designed to keep websites isolated and prevent malicious code from accessing data from other tabs. The modern web depends on this separation. But in Atlas, the AI agent isn't malicious code — it's a trusted user with permission to see and act across all sites. This undermines the core principle of browser isolation. \n\n\nThanks to Slashdot reader spatwei for suggesting the topic.","contentLength":4094,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Beyond Brute Force: 4 Secrets to Smaller, Smarter, and Dramatically Cheaper AI","url":"https://hackernoon.com/beyond-brute-force-4-secrets-to-smaller-smarter-and-dramatically-cheaper-ai?source=rss","date":1762009207,"author":"Anthony Laneau","guid":103271,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful generalists, but transforming them into specialized experts is a major challenge. The process of training a model on new, specific knowledge like internal company documents or a complex reasoning task is notoriously expensive, time-consuming, and fraught with pitfalls. We want smaller, more efficient models that can master a domain without the compute budget of a tech giant.</p><p>\\\nThe core idea behind making smaller models smarter is a concept called \"distillation.\" In this process, a smaller \"student\" model learns from a larger, more capable \"teacher\" model. The student doesn't just learn from a static textbook of examples; it learns to mimic the teacher's thought process. This is a powerful shortcut for transferring expertise.</p><p>\\\nUntil now, however, engineers have faced a frustrating trade-off. One approach, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), forces the student to learn from its own mistakes, which is relevant but painfully slow. The alternative, off-policy distillation, is much faster but dangerously flawed; the student learns from the teacher's ideal examples, which often occur in contexts the student will never encounter on its own, causing errors to compound. This has been the bottleneck for creating specialized AI; until now.</p><p>\\\nA powerful technique called \"on-policy distillation\" combines the best of both worlds. By having a teacher model provide dense, token-by-token feedback on the student model's own attempts, we can achieve breakthroughs in training efficiency and capability. Here are the four most surprising and impactful takeaways from this approach.</p><h3>A Smarter Feedback Loop Makes AI Training Up to 100x Cheaper</h3><p>The fundamental difference between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distillation lies in the density of the feedback. To understand this, imagine learning to play chess.</p><ul><li> is like learning chess by only being told if you won or lost at the very end of a match. The feedback is directly related to your actions, but it's sparse. You know you lost, but you don't know if it was because of your opening, a mid-game blunder, or a weak endgame.</li><li> is like watching a grandmaster play. You observe brilliant moves, but they are made in complex board positions that you, as a novice, will rarely find yourself in. The feedback is dense, but the context is often irrelevant to your own learning path.</li><li> provides the best of both worlds. It's like having an expert coach who grades every single one of your moves in your own games, telling you if a move was a \"blunder,\" \"inaccuracy,\" or \"brilliant.\" The feedback is both dense and perfectly relevant to your current skill level.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis smarter feedback loop has a massive impact on efficiency. In a direct back-to-back comparison where a student model learned from a teacher trained via RL, on-policy distillation allowed the student to reach the teacher's performance level 7-10 times faster in terms of gradient steps. This translates to a staggering 50-100x improvement in cumulative compute efficiency.</p><p>\\\nThe reason for this dramatic speedup is that on-policy distillation provides more useful information (more \"bits per episode\") for the model to learn from. Because this dense, token-level feedback reduces gradient noise, it allows for training with shorter contexts and smaller, more efficient batch sizes, further slashing the overall computational cost.</p><h3>You Can Cure “AI Amnesia” When Teaching New Knowledge</h3><p>A common and frustrating problem in AI is \"catastrophic forgetting.\" When you take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on new, specialized information (like your company's internal knowledge base), it often degrades or completely forgets its original, general-purpose skills, such as the ability to follow instructions.</p><p>\\\nConsider an experiment to create an \"internal assistant.\" Researchers started with the Qwen3-8B model, which had a strong instruction-following score of 85%. After fine-tuning it on a 70-30 mix of internal company documents and general chat data:</p><ul><li>Its knowledge about the documents improved significantly (from 18% to 36% on a QA evaluation).</li><li>However, its instruction-following skill degraded badly, dropping from 85% down to 79%.</li></ul><p>\\\nThe solution was a brief phase of on-policy distillation after the initial fine-tuning. By using the original version of the model as the teacher, researchers could restore the lost behavior. The results were powerful:</p><ul><li>Instruction-following performance was almost fully recovered, jumping back up to 83%.</li><li>Crucially, this happened without losing the newly acquired knowledge. In fact, the knowledge score even improved slightly to 41%.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis finding is a game-changer for \"continual learning,\" aka the ability to update models with new information over time without having to perform expensive, full-scale retraining from scratch. It provides a reliable way to teach an AI new facts without it forgetting its core skills.</p><h3>An AI Can Master a Reasoning Skill From Just One Example</h3><p>This finding is highly counterintuitive. In most AI training methods, repeatedly training a model on the exact same prompt is a recipe for failure; the model simply memorizes the answer instead of learning the underlying skill.</p><p>\\\nHowever, an experiment with on-policy distillation turned this assumption on its head. Researchers trained a student model on a math reasoning task using only a single, randomly chosen prompt. They trained on this one prompt for 20 consecutive steps, each with a batch of 256 rollouts, generating 5,120 total learning sequences.</p><p>\\\nThe remarkable outcome turns conventional wisdom on its head: the student model was able to approximately match the performance of the expert teacher model on the AIME'24 math benchmark, despite only ever having seen that one problem.</p><p>\\\nThis works because on-policy distillation teaches the model to approximate the teacher's entire thought process; its full probability distribution for what the next best token should be at every step, rather than just memorizing a final answer. This means that for certain skills, the bottleneck isn't finding thousands of examples, but creating a single, perfectly-guided learning experience.</p><h3>Why \"Practicing\" on Its Own Samples Can Make an AI Dumber</h3><p>It seems logical that if a model produces a high-quality output, you could feed that output back into its training data to reinforce good behavior. This method, known as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on on-policy data, is like having the model \"practice\" on its own best work.</p><p>\\\nBut researchers found the opposite to be true. When they trained a model using a dataset composed of its own samples, its performance on an instruction-following evaluation actually degraded.</p><p>\\\nThe technical reason for this failure is subtle but critical. While the dataset of the model's own outputs might be perfectly on-policy on average, every finite batch of data exhibits a slightly different distribution. Training on these batches causes the model’s internal policy to drift away from its original state. This process turns training on its own samples into a form of off-policy training over time, leading to the same compounding error and divergence seen in other flawed methods.</p><p>\\\nIn contrast, on-policy distillation is completely stable in this self-distillation scenario. Because the teacher model remains a fixed, consistent target, the student can robustly converge on the desired behavior without degrading. This further cements on-policy distillation as a superior and more reliable tool for behavior refinement and continual learning.</p><h3>The Future of AI is Smaller, Faster, and More Personal</h3><p>On-policy distillation is more than just another training technique; it's a foundational shift in how we create specialized, expert AI. By combining the direct relevance of learning from one's own actions with the incredible efficiency of dense, token-by-token feedback, it solves some of the biggest challenges in applied AI.</p><p>\\\nThe benefits are clear: massive compute savings, a cure for catastrophic forgetting, and unbelievable data efficiency. This is a key enabling technology that lowers the barrier to entry, unlocking the ability for more teams to build and maintain custom models that possess deep domain knowledge without sacrificing core capabilities. This democratization of expert AI will fuel new business models and create competitive advantages previously reserved for frontier labs.</p>","contentLength":8401,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI researchers ’embodied’ an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/01/ai-researchers-embodied-an-llm-into-a-robot-and-it-started-channeling-robin-williams/","date":1762009200,"author":"Julie Bort","guid":103266,"unread":true,"content":"<article>AI researchers at Andon Labs embedded various LLMs in a vacuum robot to test how ready they were to be embodied.

By studying these molecules, the researchers created a kind of miniature particle collider. Within this environment, the electrons surrounding the radium atom were confined closely enough to occasionally slip into the nucleus before returning to their usual orbits... When those electrons returned to their outer paths, they retained the altered energy, effectively carrying a \"message\" from within the nucleus that could be decoded to reveal its internal arrangement... \n\n[The researchers] trapped and cooled the molecules and sent them through a system of vacuum chambers, into which they also sent lasers, which interacted with the molecules. In this way, the researchers were able to precisely measure the energies of electrons inside each molecule. When the researchers analyzed their measurements, they noticed that the electrons carried slightly different energies than expected if they had remained outside the nucleus. The difference was incredibly small, only about one millionth of the energy of the laser photon used to excite the molecules, but it was clear evidence that the electrons had entered the radium nucleus and interacted with its protons and neutrons... \n\nThe researchers plan to use this new technique to create a detailed map of how forces are distributed inside the nucleus... to chart the nucleus with greater precision and search for possible violations of fundamental symmetries in nature. \n\n\"It is thought that additional sources of fundamental symmetry violation are required to explain the almost complete absence of antimatter in our universe,\" the article points out. \"Such violations could be seen within the nuclei of certain atoms such as radium... \n\n\n\"Unlike most atomic nuclei, which are spherical in shape, the radium atom's nucleus has a more asymmetrical configuration, similar to a pear. Scientists predict that this pear shape could significantly enhance their ability to sense the violation of fundamental symmetries, to the extent that they may be potentially observable.\"","contentLength":2606,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Hidden Ledger of Code: Tracking the Carbon Debt Inside Our Software","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-hidden-ledger-of-code-tracking-the-carbon-debt-inside-our-software?source=rss","date":1762005619,"author":"Jacob Wolinsky","guid":103270,"unread":true,"content":"<ul><li>Every line of code carries an invisible cost.

Researchers have begun quantifying this: for example, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07610\">Green Algorithms framework</a> shows that compute time, memory usage, and data center efficiency can be converted into carbon equivalent estimates for any computational task.</p><p>\\\nAt the data center scale, inefficiencies amplify.

(It’s rooted in the broader notion of ecological or climate debt.) Now, technologists are borrowing that phrase to describe software systems whose inefficiencies accrue hidden energy costs over time.</p><p>\\\nIn software, carbon debt grows when layers of redundant code, over-provisioned infrastructure, and heavy frameworks persist unchecked. A module that spawns unnecessary background jobs, or a service that overfetches data, burns CPU cycles, which burn power.</p><p>\\\nWhen infrastructure is sized with generous headroom “just in case,” that slack often stays underutilized, yet still draws baseline power. Servers and services often draw between <a href=\"https://gulfbusiness.com/why-idle-servers-not-ai-are-the-true-sustainability-threat/\">27% and 36%</a> of peak power even under light load.</p><p>\\\nAs your system advances with more users, more services, and more replicas, each inefficiency multiplies. What once was a single wasted cycle becomes thousands per second. That energy waste endures unless addressed, compounding like interest owed on an invisible balance.</p><p>\\\nNext, we’ll trace how code builds up emissions so you can see where the debt really comes from.</p><h2>How Code Accrues Emissions</h2><p>The energy footprint of software often hides in the smallest details of its logic. A loop that runs one step too long or a recursive function that never terminates efficiently can keep processors active far longer than needed. Each extra millisecond of compute draws power, and the effect multiplies when thousands of users trigger the same function at once.</p><h3>How Tiny Loops Turn Into Big Costs</h3><p>Research on mobile software shows that energy code smells can dramatically increase consumption, and in some cases, they can consume up to <a href=\"https://fpalomba.github.io/pdf/Journals/J13.pdf\">87x more energy</a> than clean versions. Follow-up work found that fixing these patterns delivered <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11479295/\">4% to 30%</a> efficiency gains in practice. These results reinforce the broader point: repetitive, seemingly minor patterns accumulate real power draw over time.</p><p>\\\nSimilar waste appears in everyday engineering habits: redundant database queries, unnecessary front-end re-renders, and dormant API endpoints all keep processors active, drawing power without improving performance.</p><p>\\\nOver-sized build artifacts and idle background tasks deepen the impact by holding memory and storage resources active long after they’re useful. When these patterns run across millions of daily transactions, the emissions scale from grams to kilograms of CO2. Quantifying that footprint is the next challenge, and few teams yet have the tools to do it precisely.</p><h2>Measuring What We Don’t See</h2><p>Tracking how much energy software really uses is harder than it sounds. The <a href=\"https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/\">Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)</a> framework from the Green Software Foundation is one of the first real attempts to make that measurable, like mapping compute time, memory use, and data transfer against actual energy data.</p><p>\\\nTools such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/\">Cloud Carbon Footprint</a> and CodeCarbon are now taking that formula a step further, embedding energy estimates directly into build pipelines and dashboards so developers can see environmental impact alongside performance metrics. This aligns with broader conversations inside the DevOps community, where teams are beginning to explore practical ways to <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/code-green-the-pragmatists-guide-to-eco-friendly-devops\">embed sustainability</a> into build and deployment workflows.</p><p>\\\nThe challenge is translating code execution into physical terms. Every watt drawn depends on processor type, cooling efficiency, and the carbon intensity of the grid that powers the data center. The same workload might have a fraction of the emissions on renewable-heavy infrastructure compared to fossil-fueled grids.</p><p>\\\nThe logic behind these tools isn’t far from how predictive analytics is being used to expose hidden operational costs in other industries, turning guesswork into measurable insight. Until this kind of visibility becomes standard in developer environments, most teams will keep optimizing performance while staying blind to the energy behind it.</p><h2>The Governance Gap: Why Carbon Isn’t Yet a Coding Metric</h2><p>Sustainability still sits outside most engineering workflows. In many companies, carbon reporting lives with facilities or operations teams, not with the people writing or deploying code.</p><p>\\\nAs a result, the energy cost of a release is rarely discussed in sprint planning or post-mortems. Agile ceremonies track velocity, story points, and error rates, but not emissions.</p><p>Few DevOps environments include “carbon sprints” or carbon budgets, even though they could be tracked the same way as uptime or latency. A <a href=\"https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/green-software-foundation-releases-first-ever-state-of-green-software-report\">report</a> based on responses from over <a href=\"https://stateof.greensoftware.foundation/en/methodology/\">2,000 software practitioners</a> has found that most organizations are still in the early stages of measuring software-related emissions. Others echoed this, noting that sustainability metrics remain largely absent from continuous-integration and delivery pipelines.</p><p>\\\nThat gap is beginning to close. Some open-source communities have started experimenting with “green commits” to tag energy-efficient changes, and enterprise dashboards are beginning to surface sustainability data next to performance KPIs. As this visibility improves, design priorities are shifting toward decay and restraint by building systems that know when to slow down, scale back, or shut off entirely.</p><h2>Designing for Decay: Making Efficiency a Default</h2><p>Architects concerned with long-lived systems often speak of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smr.2423\">architectural erosion</a> or design decay, like the gradual divergence between intended structure and runtime reality. Architecture erosion is a well-known risk in systems as features accumulate and shortcuts proliferate. One way to counter that drift is to build systems that self-optimize or sunset unused processes automatically, pruning inactive modules or trimming underutilized services based on real usage signals.</p><p>Treating code decay as a feature means embedding routines that perform periodic cleanup: archiving stale APIs, retiring dormant modules, or enforcing dependency hygiene. Frameworks may require that libraries unused for X releases be flagged or removed. Over time, the shift moves from “unlimited scaling” toward sustainable scaling, systems designed to shrink or sleep when load is low rather than running flat out forever.</p><p>\\\nEngineers can use runtime profiling, build monitoring, and garbage-collection heat maps as signals. If a microservice’s CPU utilization stays near zero for weeks, it raises a refactor or archive flag. If build artifacts grow without change, they are flagged for pruning.</p><p>\\\nThis philosophy sets the stage for what’s next: making carbon visibility part of everyday decision-making, and bringing engineering metrics and emissions metrics into the same ecosystem.</p><h2>The Road to Carbon Transparency</h2><p>Imagine an IDE where each file, function, or commit carries a live “emissions counter”; you write a loop, and you see how much energy it might cost. That’s the direction software tooling is heading. Build tools could come to flag carbon-heavy changes before they’re merged.</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379003736_Carbon-Awareness_in_CICD\">CI/CD pipelines</a> will evolve to flag carbon-intensive builds, perhaps even rejecting code that spikes emissions far above baseline. With tighter integration, carbon metrics will merge with performance dashboards, showing build time, throughput, and CO2 cost in one pane.</p><h3>Cloud Dashboards &amp; Deployment Transparency</h3><p>Cloud providers may expose per-deployment carbon cost insights, mapping workload emissions to regions, instance types, and schedules. The same principle underpins the idea of <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/carbon-aware-computing-next-green-breakthrough-or-new-greenwashing\">carbon-aware computing</a>, where workloads shift dynamically to regions or times with cleaner grids. Integrating that into the same console where devs monitor CPU, bandwidth, and billing makes sustainability part of everyday trade-offs.</p><p>\\\nWith visibility in place, engineers will begin to optimize not just for latency or memory, but for carbon as a first-class metric. Those insights will shape budgeting decisions, drive architecture choices (edge, serverless, off-peak scheduling), and enforce sustainable defaults in code.</p><p>\\\nAhead lies a time when your pull request comes with a carbon delta and teams judge changes not only by correctness or performance, but by how much energy they add or save.</p><h2>Engineering Accountability</h2><p>Sustainability in software doesn’t start in a server farm, but it starts at the keyboard. Every query, commit, and deployment decision shapes the energy profile of the systems we run. For years, efficiency meant speed and uptime, and now it also means restraint.</p><p>\\\nAcross the industry, teams are beginning to treat carbon debt the same way they treat technical debt: as something that compounds if ignored. Cleaning up unused code, right-sizing infrastructure, or pausing idle jobs are no longer side tasks; they’re acts of maintenance that protect performance and the planet.</p><p>\\\nAs tooling matures, carbon visibility will become part of normal governance, sitting next to reliability and security in every build report. The responsibility won’t rest with operations alone but with every engineer who touches code. Because in modern software, clean code and clean energy belong to the same conversation, and writing one well means caring about the other.</p>","contentLength":11106,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Go: Can It Mitigate Supply Chain Attacks?","url":"https://hackernoon.com/go-can-it-mitigate-supply-chain-attacks?source=rss","date":1762005611,"author":"Go [Technical Documentation]","guid":103269,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Modern software engineering is collaborative, and based on reusing Open Source software. That exposes targets to supply chain attacks, where software projects are attacked by compromising their dependencies.</p><p>\\\nDespite any process or technical measure, every dependency is unavoidably a trust relationship. However, the Go tooling and design help mitigate risk at various stages.</p><p>There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.</p><p>\\\nUnlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the  file of the main module.</p><p>\\\nSince Go 1.16, this determinism is enforced by default, and build commands (, , , , …) <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-updates\">will fail if the go.mod is incomplete</a>. The only commands that will change the  (and therefore the build) are  and . These commands are not expected to be run automatically or in CI, so changes to dependency trees must be made deliberately and have the opportunity to go through code review.</p><p>\\\nThis is very important for security, because when a CI system or new machine runs , the checked-in source is the ultimate and complete source of truth for what will get built. There is no way for third parties to affect that.</p><p>\\\nMoreover, when a dependency is added with , its transitive dependencies are added at the version specified in the dependency’s  file, not at their latest versions, thanks to <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection\">Minimal version selection</a>. The same happens for invocations of <code>go install example.com/cmd/devtoolx@latest</code>, <a href=\"https://research.swtch.com/npm-colors\">the equivalents of which in some ecosystems bypass pinning</a>. In Go, the latest version of  will be fetched, but then all the dependencies will be set by its  file.</p><p>\\\nIf a module gets compromised and a new malicious version is published, no one will be affected until they explicitly update that dependency, providing the opportunity to review the changes and time for the ecosystem to detect the event.</p><h2>Version contents never change</h2><p>Another key property necessary to ensure third parties can’t affect builds is that the contents of a module version are immutable. If an attacker that compromises a dependency could re-upload an existing version, they could automatically compromise all projects that depend on it.</p><p>\\\nThat’s what the  file is for. It contains a list of cryptographic hashes of each dependency that contributes to the build. Again, an incomplete  causes an error, and only  and  will modify it, so any changes to it will accompany a deliberate dependency change. Other builds are guaranteed to have a full set of checksums.</p><p>\\\nThis is a common feature of most lock files. Go goes beyond it with the <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database\">Checksum Database</a> (sumdb for short), a global append-only cryptographically-verifiable list of go.sum entries. When  needs to add an entry to the  file, it fetches it from the sumdb along with cryptographic proof of the sumdb integrity. This ensures that not only every build of a certain module uses the same dependency contents, but that every module out there uses the same dependency contents!</p><p>\\\nThe sumdb makes it impossible for compromised dependencies or even Google-operated Go infrastructure to target specific dependents with modified (e.g. backdoored) source. You’re guaranteed to be using the exact same code that everyone else who’s using e.g. v1.9.2 of  is using and has reviewed.</p><p>\\\nFinally, my favorite features of the sumdb: it doesn’t require any key management on the part of module authors, and it works seamlessly with the decentralized nature of Go modules.</p><h2>The VCS is the source of truth</h2><p>Most projects are developed through some version control system (VCS) and then, in other ecosystems, uploaded to the package repository. This means there are two accounts that could be compromised, the VCS host and the package repository, the latter of which is used more rarely and more likely to be overlooked. It also means it’s easier to hide malicious code in the version uploaded to the repository, especially if the source is routinely modified as part of the upload, for example to minimize it.</p><p>\\\nIn Go, there is no such thing as a package repository account. The import path of a package embeds the information that <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Remote_import_paths\">needs in order to fetch its module</a> directly from the VCS, where tags define versions.</p><p>\\\nWe do have the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/module-mirror-launch\">Go Module Mirror</a>, but that’s only a proxy. Module authors don’t register an account and don’t upload versions to the proxy. The proxy uses the same logic that the  tool uses (in fact, the proxy runs ) to fetch and cache a version. Since the Checksum Database guarantees that there can be only one source tree for a given module version, everyone using the proxy will see the same result as everyone bypassing it and fetching directly from the VCS. (If the version is not available anymore in the VCS or if its contents changed, fetching directly will lead to an error, while fetching from the proxy might still work, improving availability and protecting the ecosystem from <a href=\"https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm\">“left-pad” issues</a>.)</p><p>\\\nRunning VCS tools on the client exposes a pretty large attack surface. That’s another place the Go Module Mirror helps: the  tool on the proxy runs inside a robust sandbox and is configured to support every VCS tool, while <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#vcs-govcs\">the default is to only support the two major VCS systems</a> (git and Mercurial). Anyone using the proxy can still fetch code published using off-by-default VCS systems, but attackers can’t reach that code in most installations.</p><h2>Building code doesn’t execute it</h2><p>It is an explicit security design goal of the Go toolchain that neither fetching nor building code will let that code execute, even if it is untrusted and malicious. This is different from most other ecosystems, many of which have first-class support for running code at package fetch time. These “post-install” hooks have been used in the past as the most convenient way to turn a compromised dependency into compromised developer machines, and to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm\">worm</a> through module authors.</p><p>\\\nTo be fair, if you’re fetching some code it’s often to execute it shortly afterwards, either as part of tests on a developer machine or as part of a binary in production, so lacking post-install hooks is only going to slow down attackers. (There is no security boundary within a build: any package that contributes to a build can define an  function.) However, it can be a meaningful risk mitigation, since you might be executing a binary or testing a package that only uses a subset of the module’s dependencies. For example, if you build and execute  on macOS there is no way for a Windows-only dependency or a dependency of <code>example.com/cmd/othertool</code> to compromise your machine.</p><p>\\\nIn Go, modules that don’t contribute code to a specific build have no security impact on it.</p><h2>“A little copying is better than a little dependency”</h2><p>The final and maybe most important software supply chain risk mitigation in the Go ecosystem is the least technical one: Go has a culture of rejecting large dependency trees, and of preferring a bit of copying to adding a new dependency. It goes all the way back to one of the Go proverbs: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxWCEmMJFW0-TvSMzcMEAHZcpt2FsVXP65\">“a little copying is better than a little dependency”</a>. The label “zero dependencies” is proudly worn by high-quality reusable Go modules. If you find yourself in need of a library, you’re likely to find it will not cause you to take on a dependency on dozens of other modules by other authors and owners.</p><p>\\\nThat’s enabled also by the rich standard library and additional modules (the  ones), which provide commonly used high-level building blocks such as an HTTP stack, a TLS library, JSON encoding, etc.</p><p>\\\nAll together this means it’s possible to build rich, complex applications with just a handful of dependencies. No matter how good the tooling is, it can’t eliminate the risk involved in reusing code, so the strongest mitigation will always be a small dependency tree.</p><p>\\\n<em>This article is available on&nbsp;&nbsp;under a CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</em></p>","contentLength":8072,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Samsung Building Facility With 50,000 Nvidia GPUs To Automate Chip Manufacturing","url":"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2352207/samsung-building-facility-with-50000-nvidia-gpus-to-automate-chip-manufacturing?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762002000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":103219,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: Korean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.

Microsoft released its latest quarterly earnings report and proved the worst of our fears about its gaming brand. Not only are Xbox hardware sales down significantly, but the brand itself is barely treading water. Gamers are voicing their displeasure with their wallets, but Microsoft's top brass is still only thinking about the margins. Microsoft was more keen to promote the scale of its cloud and AI services revenue -- which was up 28% year over year -- than talk about its beleaguered gaming brand. The company's overall gaming revenue fell by 2% compared to the same time last year. This was precipitated by a \"decline in Xbox hardware,\" which was down by 22% following a steady decline quarter after quarter. Its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription were doing better, though the overall growth was only up by 1%, and even that was driven by the \"better-than-expected performance\" of third-party games. You can give credit to titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for why Xbox isn't in an even deeper hole than it is now.\n \nThe tech giant has no expectation that its Xbox brand will start making more money anytime soon. In its earnings call with investors, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects Xbox will continue to decline \"in the low to mid-single digits\" for the following quarter. That's mostly due to the lack of landmark first-party titles. Just this month, Xbox released Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, and Double Fine's The Keeper. Xbox also made a huge marketing push for its first handheld, made in partnership with Asus, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X. In any other year, this would be a big month for any gaming company. The dour outlook comes after months of bad news. After two subsequent price hikes, Xbox Series S and Series X consoles now cost between $100 to $150 more than they did at launch five years ago. Microsoft also pushed prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier from $20 to $30 per month. A full-year's subscription would now demand $360. In a separate article, Gizmodo reviews Microsoft's new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which \"offers a better experience overall\" than the \"other small-scale Windows PC gaming devices released this year.\" However, \"it's still nowhere close to what you truly want from a console.\"","contentLength":2436,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OpenAI Launches Aardvark To Detect and Patch Hidden Bugs In Code","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2314223/openai-launches-aardvark-to-detect-and-patch-hidden-bugs-in-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761963000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":103167,"unread":true,"content":"OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous agent that scans, reasons about, and patches code like a human security researcher. \"By embedding itself directly into the development pipeline, Aardvark aims to turn security from a post-development concern into a continuous safeguard that evolves with the software itself,\" reports InfoWorld. From the report: What makes Aardvark unique, OpenAI noted, is its combination of reasoning, automation, and verification. Rather than simply highlighting potential vulnerabilities, the agent promises multi-stage analysis -- starting by mapping an entire repository and building a contextual threat model around it. From there, it continuously monitors new commits, checking whether each change introduces risk or violates existing security patterns.\n \nAdditionally, upon identifying a potential issue, Aardvark attempts to validate the exploitability of the finding in a sandboxed environment before flagging it. This validation step could prove transformative. Traditional static analysis tools often overwhelm developers with false alarms -- issues that may look risky but aren't truly exploitable. \"The biggest advantage is that it will reduce false positives significantly,\" noted Jain. \"It's helpful in open source codes and as part of the development pipeline.\"\n \nOnce a vulnerability is confirmed, Aardvark integrates with Codex to propose a patch, then re-analyzes the fix to ensure it doesn't introduce new problems. OpenAI claims that in benchmark tests, the system identified 92 percent of known and synthetically introduced vulnerabilities across test repositories, a promising indication that AI may soon shoulder part of the burden of modern code auditing.","contentLength":1724,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FCC To Rescind Ruling That Said ISPs Are Required To Secure Their Networks","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/237241/fcc-to-rescind-ruling-that-said-isps-are-required-to-secure-their-networks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761960600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":103158,"unread":true,"content":"The FCC plans to repeal a Biden-era ruling that required ISPs to secure their networks under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, instead relying on voluntary cybersecurity commitments from telecom providers.

The legislation, approved <a href=\"https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2023/23-0281_CAF_3-24-23.pdf\">unanimously</a>, called specifically for greater fairness in the “vulnerability” scoring system that The Markup analyzed. Used by Los Angeles for the past decade, the system <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/investigation/2023/02/28/l-a-s-scoring-system-for-subsidized-housing-gives-black-and-latino-people-experiencing-homelessness-lower-priority-scores\">rated Black people as significantly less vulnerable</a> than White people year after year, making them less likely to obtain subsidized permanent housing.</p><p>\\\nBlack people are hugely overrepresented among unhoused people in L.A., making up about 9 percent of Los Angeles County’s population but about 30 percent of the county’s people experiencing homelessness.</p><p>\\\n“To see that the tool that we’re using to put people in line for housing was not actually housing unhoused Black Angelenos as quickly as we could was really surprising to me,” said Raman, who read the article in the Los Angeles Times, where it was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/black-latino-homeless-people-housing-priority-list-los-angeles\">co-published</a>. Raman, who is currently running for re-election in District Four, in central LA, said the investigation “absolutely” spurred the council to act.</p><p>\\\nLAHSA, given a deadline of April 2023 in the legislation, still has not provided a reform plan. A spokesperson for the agency didn’t directly respond to a request for comment about the plan.</p><p>\\\nRaman said LAHSA has taken some steps in the past year to improve how it allocates housing. Among other changes, she said, the agency has started to prioritize some groups, including those already involved in housing programs and those who already have the documents required to move into a building, like an ID and social security number.</p><p>\\\nMeanwhile, the agency <a href=\"https://www.lahsa.org/news?article=936-changes-to-ces-psh-prioritization-and-matching\">also de-emphasized</a> the score’s importance in placing people for permanent housing. People applying for housing are scored on a 17-point scale. Previously, the people with the highest scores were given the highest priority, but now any person who scores an eight or above can be prioritized, depending on the other factors being considered.</p><p>\\\nStill, equity in the housing system remains a known problem. In November, researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles, working in partnership with LAHSA, released <a href=\"https://cais.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CESTTRR-Final-Report-2023.pdf\">a long-awaited study</a> on racial bias in the system and ways to reform the scoring system, known as the VI-SPDAT.</p><p>\\\nThe study, which analyzed scores across race and ethnicity, tracked with The Markup’s findings from earlier in the year, concluding that the scoring tool is biased toward White people and that it’s ineffective overall. The study, in some respects, went even further. Using data on who ultimately faced an “adverse” event, like jail or death, the researchers concluded that tool was “not much more accurate than a random guess at predicting vulnerability.”</p><p>\\\nThe study suggested several ways the scoring system could become more accurate and equitable, some of which matched The Markup’s reporting. The scoring system asks intensely personal questions about a person’s life, including around issues like violence and substance abuse, and the report <a href=\"https://cais.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CESTTRR-Final-Report-2023.pdf#page=89\">recommends rewording and reframing</a> questions to make the survey less complex and more sensitive. A revised version of the system with new questions and scoring could substantially reduce bias, the researchers conclude.</p><p>\\\nFor example, the study suggests that the existing question about whether anyone has “forced you or tricked you to do things that you do not want to do” should be amended to stress that answering yes “will not result in punishment or any negative consequences.” Another question currently asks, “Are there any medications like painkillers that you don’t take the way the doctor prescribed or where you sell the medication?” The study suggested softening it to, “Do you have medication that you choose to sell instead of taking to help support yourself financially? Answering yes to this question will not result in punishment or negative consequences for you.” Several questions were suggested for removal entirely.</p><p>\\\nIn a written statement, LAHSA spokesperson Christopher Yee acknowledged that it’s long been clear that “the VI-SPDAT has shortcomings related to equity,” adding that the survey is “long, cumbersome, and not trauma-informed in the content of the questions or administration process.”</p><p>\\\nYee highlighted the study on recommended changes to the system and said the agency is “working with key partners and stakeholders to create a plan to implement and refine” a new iteration of the scoring system while it continues to use the old version.</p><p>\\\nThe agency, he noted, has already dropped a requirement to score people for interim housing entry or time-limited subsidy programs, but will still require scoring for permanent housing. LAHSA must use some sort of prioritization system to access certain federal housing funds under <a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/17-01CPDN.PDF\">rules</a> established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development.</p><p>\\\nThe planned changes to the scoring system will first apply to screening for adults, and later the agency plans to explore changes to related tools for young people and families with children. The Markup found that racial disparities were even more stark for a variation of the VI-SPDAT used in Los Angeles for people under the age of 25.</p><p>\\\nYee’s statement did not provide a timeline for the revised tool’s launch, but in <a href=\"https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=7737-cesttrr-report-faq.pdf\">a FAQ</a> released alongside the study LAHSA said service providers could expect more information early this year on changes to the intake process, known as the Coordinated Entry System.</p><p>\\\nRaman, for her part, said she’s withholding judgment until data can show how those changes affect who is housed. But, she said, “there’s no question in my mind that CES needs reform.”</p>","contentLength":6475,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Austria's Ministry of Economy Has Migrated To a Nextcloud Platform In Shift Away From US Tech","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2023230/austrias-ministry-of-economy-has-migrated-to-a-nextcloud-platform-in-shift-away-from-us-tech?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761955800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":103156,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: Even before Azure had a global failure this week, Austria's Ministry of Economy had taken a decisive step toward digital sovereignty. The Ministry achieved this status by migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure. This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.\n \nEuropean companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is \" to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European.\" What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"\n \nAustria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies. The organizations include the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the Austrian military, Danish government organizations, and the French city of Lyon. All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.","contentLength":2108,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"YouTube TV Loses ESPN, ABC and Other Disney Channels","url":"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2017209/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761953400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":103155,"unread":true,"content":"Disney's channels, including ESPN, ABC, FX, and NatGeo, have gone dark on YouTube TV after Google and Disney failed to renew their carriage agreement before the October 30 deadline, with each side blaming the other for using unfair negotiating tactics and price hikes.

In the video, White expressed concern that YouTube's automated flagging process may be the root of the problem, as he found it hard to believe that \"creating a local account in Windows 11 could lead to serious harm or even death,\" as YouTube reportedly alleged when it removed the video. \n\nWhen he appealed, White said that YouTube denied the request within 10 to 20 minutes, early on a Sunday morning, which led him to speculate that there wasn't a human in the loop when the request was shut down. That wasn't his only video removed, either. The next day, White uploaded his video for this week on installing Windows 11 25H2 on unsupported hardware, which was removed hours after being posted. YouTube justified the removal on similar grounds.

Once there, the applied holography quickly joined the quest into the properties of this phase that had long evaded a consistent and satisfactory explanation.</p><p>\\\nInstead of going after the NFL fermion propagator, however, many of the holographic proposals focused on reproducing the experimental data in the cuprates - and often times even claimed achieving a quantitative agreement.</p><p>\\\nIn light of its intrinsically unsettled status one would have thought that it might be rather detrimental for any speculative approach to seek out not a mere qualitative but an actual quantitative, down to the number, agreement between its specific predictions and some preselected sets of experimental data. In fact, if such a quantitative agreement were indeed achieved one would have even more explaining to do (first and foremost, as to why an apriori approximate approach appears to be so unexpectedly accurate?).</p><p>\\\nThe earlier discussion of some of the popular evidence in support of condensed matter holography as well as the debunking of a number of its specific predictions [26] can be found in [34]. However, the admirable persistence with which those predictions continued to be regularly cited in the subsequent holographic literature [35] suggests that the comments of [34] might have had been (most regretfully) overlooked.</p><p>\\\nIn fact, there is more than a single reason for which semiclassical holography (or its improvement at the level of accounting for the matter back-reaction in the HartreeFock approximation) - thus far, the only practical way of performing the holographic calculations [26–29] - would not have been expected to provide any quantitatively accurate results in the first place. There are, of course, such obvious differences from the string-theoretical holographic constructions as a low physical value of N (which, in practice, often amounts to ’spin up/down’) and the lack of Lorentz, translational, and/or rotational (as well as any super-)symmetries.</p><p>\\\nArguably, though, the most important is the fact that much of the condensed matter physics operates in the intermediate - as opposed to ultra-strong - interaction regime, while it is only the latter that is supposed to have a weakly coupled gravity as its bulk dual [26]. Indeed, most solids form under the condition that its potential (interaction) and kinetic energies on average balance each other out. This suggests that the ’bona fide’ strong-coupling regime could only become attainable in some sort of a ’flat band’ scenario where kinetic energy is completely quenched or, at least, significantly diminished.</p><p>\\\nIn light of that, it is unsurprising that much of the recent effort towards implementing such mechanism has been centered on the SYK model and its variants [31] whose ’flat band’ nature facilitates the existence of a holographic dual. A viable candidate to this role was proposed in the form of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) dilatonenhanced 1 + 1-dimensional gravity [31].</p><p>\\\nIt is worth pointing out, though, that at the practical level all the holographic matching between the SYK and JT theories has been, so far, established within their low-energy sectors that are both controlled by a single soft Schwarzian mode (’boundary graviton’). So as far as the low-energy properties of the two models are concerned, they both allow for the same (effectively 0 + 1- dimensional) description in terms of either a fluctuating 1d boundary or Liouvillian-type large-N matrix quantum mechanics [31, 36]. This is not surprising given the intrinsically non-dynamical nature of 2d (and 3d) pure gravity. Such a caveat notwithstanding, the low-energy SYK-JT equivalence has been repeatedly and staunchly referred to as a genuine example of holographic correspondence between the 1+1-dimensional bulk and 0+1-dimensional boundary theories [31].</p><p>\\\nAs to the general HV models (22) and corresponding vacuum metrics (26), the standard list of observables to be matched includes temperature-dependent specific heat</p><p>\\\nand frequency-dependent optical conductivity</p><p>\\\ndetermined by the bare scaling dimensions.</p><p>\\\nIncidentally, this value of the HV parameter was previously singled out on the basis of analyzing entanglement entropy [28]. Besides, it suggests the interpretation of d − θ as an effective number of dimensions orthogonal to the FS.</p><p>\\\nThe other frequently invoked relation [26, 28, 29] is</p><p>\\\nin which case the first inequality in (27) is marginally satisfied as equality. Notably, in 2d it would only be consistent with (40) for z = 3/2.</p><p>\\\nAlso, from the beginning of the cuprates saga an even greater fixation has always been on the linear-T dependence of resistivity, also observed in a variety of other materials [35]. Of course, the conductivity scaling with frequency (39) does not readily translate into its temperature dependence, as it would be determined by a specific mechanism of momentum relaxation (i.e., Umklapp, phonons, and/or disorder).</p><p>\\\nTo this end, the use of the memory matrix technique yielded a proper conductivity scaling [26, 35] in both limits of strong,</p><p>\\\nmomentum-non-conserving scattering where ∆ is the dimension of the leading translation invariance-breaking 8 operator. The formulas (42) and (43) agree for ∆ = z + (d − θ)/2 which condition coincides with that of marginal fulfillment of the Harris criterion for the disorder scattering to become a relevant perturbation.</p><p>\\\nAn alternate interpretation of the linear-T resistivity, σ(T ) ∼ 1/T , proposed in [26, 35] relates it to the FL-like entropy, S(T ) ∼ C(T ) ∼ T . This school of thought introduces the notion of inelastic ’Planckian’ scattering rate as a potentially single most important scale for thermalization/equilibration/information scrambling (albeit not a rate of momentum relaxation) in strongly interacting systems</p><p>\\\nInterestingly, it is the (admittedly, unphysical) model of [38] that so far has managed to reproduce a longer list of the power-law dependencies found in the cuprates, as compared to the competing schemes [39]. Unfortunately, such a serendipitous success does not offer any immediate insight into the underlying mechanism of the NFL behavior in the cuprates.</p><p>\\\nFurthermore, contrasting the large-r and -τ asymptotics (31) of the HV holographic propagators against their eikonal/bosonization counterparts in search of some agreement suggests finite positive values of θ, contrary to the ’Planckian’ scenario. This observation might further reduce the chances of constructing a consistent HV holographic model of the strange metal phase in the cuprates.</p><p>\\\nIn part, the deficiencies of the HV-based approach have been circumvented by the arrival of the ’second SYK wave’ [40] which utilizes the Hamiltonian obtained from the conventional combination of a kinetic (quadratic) and interaction (quartic) terms by randomizing the amplitudes of either one or both of these terms a la SY K. Making such randomization spatially non-uniform one opens a channel for non-conservation of momentum which then gives rise to the linear-T ’Planckian’ rate (on top of a constant).</p><p>\\\nOf course, the very existence of different explanations (cf., for example, [35, 39] and [40]) for certain scaling laws observed in the cuprates may suggest that their ultimate interpretation is yet to be found. It would be, therefore, imperative to strive to extend the list of matching properties, akin to [38, 39] as the means of discriminating between the competing schemes.</p><p>(1) D. V.

How would Canva serve the users who preferred Affinity's perpetually licensed apps to Adobe's subscription-only software suite? And how would Affinity's strong stance against generative AI be reconciled with Canva's embrace of those technologies. \n\nThis week, Canva gave us definitive answers to all of those questions: a brand-new unified Affinity app that melds the Photo, Designer, and Publisher apps into a single piece of software called \"Affinity by Canva\" that is free to use with a Canva user account, but which gates generative AI features behind Canva's existing paid subscription plans ($120 a year for individuals). \n\nThis does seem like mostly good news, in the near to mid term, for existing Affinity app users who admired Affinity's anti-AI stance: All three apps' core features are free to use, and the stuff you're being asked to pay for is stuff you mostly don't want anyway. But it may come as unwelcome news for those who like the predictability of pay-once-own-forever software or are nervous about where Canva might draw the line between \"free\" and \"premium\" features down the line. \n\n[...] There's now a dedicated page for the older versions of the Affinity apps, and an FAQ at the bottom of that page answers several questions about the fate of those apps. Affinity and Canva say they will continue to keep the activation servers and downloads for all Affinity v1 and v2 apps online for the foreseeable future, giving people who already own the existing apps a way to keep using the versions they're comfortable with. Users can opt to link their Serif Affinity store accounts to their new Canva accounts to access the old downloads without juggling multiple accounts.

The project positions itself as a Real Estate Financing (ReFi) protocol that will modernize how capital flows into property development, but the proof will depend on whether it can deliver where others have failed.</p><p>\\\nThe timing appears calculated. The <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/research-report/top-real-world-asset-rwa-projects/\">tokenized real-world asset market crossed $30 billion in 2025</a>, a figure that reflects roughly a 10-fold increase from 2022 levels. Private credit accounts for approximately $17 billion of this total, while U.S. Treasuries make up $7.3 billion. The momentum suggests that institutions are finding utility in blockchain infrastructure for specific use cases, particularly those involving yield-bearing assets with standardized documentation.</p><h2>Understanding ReFi and What Construct Koin Actually Does</h2><p>Real Estate Financing through blockchain differs from the property tokenization projects that dominated headlines in previous cycles. Instead of selling fractional ownership in buildings, ReFi protocols focus on the financing process itself. Think of it as digitizing the loan origination and management workflow rather than the asset title.</p><p>\\\nConstruct Koin operates by connecting property developers who need capital with investors who provide it through token purchases. The platform claims to use artificial intelligence integrated with Building Information Management (BIM) software to analyze development proposals and make lending decisions in hours rather than the weeks or months typical in traditional finance. According to the project website, loans are secured by legal charges registered on title deeds with HM Land Registry in the UK, providing a layer of protection through real property collateral.</p><p>\\\nThe mechanics work through a loan book model. When developers borrow funds, they pay interest and profit shares back to the protocol. CTK token holders who stake their tokens receive 8 to 12% annual percentage rates paid in USDT stablecoin. The protocol claims it currently has <a href=\"https://www.constructkoin.com/\">£15 million of assets already secured on-chain</a>, though independent verification of this figure through public blockchain explorers remains limited in available documentation.</p><h2>Breaking Down the $100 Million Presale Structure</h2><p>The fundraising approach spans 10 phases, each with a price increment. The first phase opened at $0.10 per token, and the final phase will close at $1.00 per token at the Token Generation Event (TGE). The model resembles how venture capital rounds work, with later participants paying higher prices than earlier ones. Out of the 1 billion total token supply, 400 million tokens have been allocated to the presale.</p><p>\\\nThis represents 40% of the total supply going to public participants. Another 15% has been earmarked for staking rewards, 20% for ecosystem growth, 15% for team and advisors, and 10% for liquidity and reserves. The vesting schedules for team tokens matter here, though specific timeframes were not detailed in the publicly available documentation. Projects that allow insiders to sell immediately after launch have historically faced selling pressure that can depress token prices.</p><p>\\\nThe presale accepts payments through both fiat channels (credit cards, bank transfers) and six major cryptocurrency networks including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. Minimum purchase amounts vary by network due to transaction fee structures. Ethereum requires a $100 minimum due to higher gas fees, while networks like Polygon and Solana allow $10 minimum purchases. The tokens will remain locked until TGE, which the project estimates will occur 12 to 24 months from launch.</p><h2>The Technology Stack and AI Claims</h2><p>The project emphasizes its use of AI for underwriting decisions. Traditional property development loans can take weeks or months to process as lenders manually review business plans, financial projections, and construction documents. Construct Koin claims its system achieves a 95% speed improvement by automating this analysis through machine learning models that assess risk based on multiple data points.</p><p>\\\nThe integration with BIM systems provides the AI with access to architectural plans, material specifications, and construction schedules. In theory, this allows the algorithm to evaluate whether a project is feasible, properly costed, and likely to complete on time. The platform processes applications and provides offers in hours rather than weeks, according to marketing materials. However, the details about which specific AI models are being used, what training data they rely on, and how they handle edge cases remain undisclosed.</p><p>\\\nThe technical infrastructure runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The smart contracts are described as audited, though the names of the audit firms and links to audit reports were not prominently featured in the reviewed materials. The choice of Ethereum provides compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure and wallet solutions, but it also means users will contend with network congestion and variable transaction fees unless they utilize Layer 2 solutions.</p><h2>Market Context and the RWA Surge</h2><p>Understanding where Construct Koin fits requires context about the broader <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/26/real-world-asset-tokenization-market-has-grown-almost-fivefold-in-3-years\">real-world asset tokenization movement</a>. The sector experienced 380% growth over three years, reaching <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/26/real-world-asset-tokenization-market-has-grown-almost-fivefold-in-3-years\">$24 billion by mid-2025</a> according to a report by RedStone, Gauntlet, and RWA.xyz. This represents a shift from experimental pilots to scaled institutional adoption, particularly in fixed income and private credit categories.</p><p>\\\nMajor financial institutions have entered the space. BlackRock launched a $2.9 billion tokenized fund (BUIDL), while Franklin Templeton's tokenized money market fund represents $420 million in assets. Goldman Sachs partnered with BNY Mellon to tokenize money market funds, supported by regulatory frameworks that aim to streamline settlement and reduce costs. The institutional involvement provides validation that blockchain infrastructure can solve real operational problems in capital markets.</p><h2>Who is Building This and Corporate Structure</h2><p>Chris Baldrey-Chouro serves as CEO and founder of Construct Koin. According to a <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/the-crypto-podcast/id1578175723\">podcast interview on The Crypto Podcast</a>, Baldrey-Chouro describes the project as executing \"one of the most innovative fundraising strategies in crypto history.\" His background includes work in recruitment and staffing solutions for commerce, based on corporate registry information.</p><p>\\\nThis multi-jurisdictional setup is common among crypto projects seeking to optimize for regulatory environments while maintaining operational flexibility. The UK entity provides legitimacy through Companies House registration and operates under UK corporate law. The BVI structure offers advantages for token operations, while the Dubai presence targets the Middle East market, which represents over $2 trillion in real estate value according to project materials.</p><p>The project positions itself as compliance-first, a pitch aimed at institutional allocators who need legal clarity before committing capital. The protocol includes KYC and AML requirements for all investors, with enhanced due diligence for purchases exceeding $10,000. This approach contrasts with many DeFi protocols that operate pseudonymously or with minimal identity verification.</p><p>\\\nThe emphasis on milestone-driven disbursements and oracle-verified events addresses one of the key concerns institutional investors have about blockchain-based financing. Traditional tranche financing releases funds only after borrowers meet specific milestones such as completing foundation work or reaching specific construction stages. Construct Koin claims its smart contracts replicate this structure by releasing capital only after verification of progress, reducing the risk of fund misuse.</p><p>\\\nThe security model relies on conservative loan-to-value ratios of 60 to 70%. This means if a developer defaults, the property securing the loan should be worth significantly more than the outstanding debt, allowing the protocol to recover funds through foreclosure and sale. The protocol also maintains an insurance vault funded by a portion of fees to cover defaults beyond normal parameters. Whether these mechanisms will perform as designed during an actual default scenario remains untested.</p><h2>The Presale Risk Landscape in 2025</h2><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://cryptsy.com/red-flags-to-watch-for-in-crypto-presales/\">Common red flags in presales include</a> anonymous teams, unrealistic return promises, poorly written whitepapers, unclear tokenomics, and lack of transparency about milestones. Legitimate projects typically disclose team identities, provide detailed technical documentation, show clear roadmaps, and communicate regularly about progress. Projects that lack these elements often disappear after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens.</p><p>\\\nThe regulatory environment adds another layer of complexity. Crypto projects face scrutiny about whether their tokens constitute securities under various jurisdictions. The classification determines which regulations apply and what disclosures are required. Projects that ignore legal frameworks or operate without proper licensing expose themselves and their investors to enforcement actions, frozen assets, and potential criminal charges.</p><h2>Real Estate Tokenization Track Record</h2><p>The history of real estate tokenization projects provides lessons. Multiple ventures have attempted to bring property onto blockchain with mixed results. Early projects focused on fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy shares in specific buildings. These faced challenges with liquidity, regulatory compliance, and the complexity of managing physical assets through digital interfaces.</p><p>\\\nMore recent projects have shifted toward the financing layer rather than ownership tokenization. This approach encounters fewer regulatory hurdles since it deals with loan products rather than securities representing property ownership. However, the business model still requires borrowers, which means projects must build relationships with developers and prove they can provide capital at competitive rates.</p><p>\\\nThe question of whether blockchain adds genuine value or merely adds complexity remains contentious. Supporters argue that on-chain transparency, programmable terms, and global capital access justify the technology overhead. Critics point out that traditional finance already has efficient systems for real estate lending and that blockchain's benefits are often overstated relative to implementation costs.</p><p>Several execution risks warrant examination. First, the loan book model requires a steady pipeline of creditworthy borrowers. If developers can obtain financing through traditional channels at lower costs, they have little incentive to use a new platform that charges fees. The project must either offer better terms than banks or target developers who cannot access traditional financing, which introduces credit risk.</p><p>\\\nSecond, the AI underwriting system remains largely unproven at scale. While automation can speed processes, it also concentrates risk if the algorithms make systematic errors. A series of bad loans could deplete the insurance fund and leave token holders with losses. The lack of detailed information about the AI's training data, error rates, and decision-making process makes it difficult to assess this risk.</p><p>\\\nThird, regulatory changes could impact operations. Governments continue to develop frameworks for crypto assets and tokenized securities. A regulatory crackdown in key markets could force the project to halt operations, delist from exchanges, or face enforcement actions. The multi-jurisdictional structure provides some flexibility but also creates compliance complexity across multiple legal systems.</p><p>\\\nFourth, the token economics depend on sustained borrower demand and investor interest. If loan volume does not grow as projected, staking rewards may decline, reducing demand for the token. If token prices fall significantly below the purchase price, early investors may become discouraged and sell, creating additional downward pressure. The long lock-up period until TGE means investors cannot exit if circumstances change.</p><p>Looking at established players in the space provides benchmarks. <a href=\"https://coinpedia.org/research-report/top-real-world-asset-rwa-projects/\">Centrifuge has achieved $1 billion in Total Value Locked</a>, making it the third RWA protocol to reach this milestone. The platform tokenizes invoices, receivables, and trade finance instruments, pushing them into DeFi markets as collateral. Centrifuge completed a V3 migration in 2025, delivering multichain infrastructure across six EVM chains.</p><p>\\\nOndo Finance focuses on institutional-grade tokenized securities and has built infrastructure for bringing fixed-income products on-chain. The platform emphasizes compliance and works within regulatory frameworks rather than attempting to circumvent them. This approach has allowed Ondo to partner with traditional financial institutions and build sustainable business models.</p><p>\\\nThe difference between these established protocols and a new entrant like Construct Koin lies in track record. Centrifuge and Ondo have processed real transactions, demonstrated their technology works, and built reputations over multiple years. They have also secured institutional backing and navigated regulatory processes. Construct Koin must still prove it can execute its vision and deliver returns to token holders.</p><h2>What The Numbers Actually Show</h2><p>The project claims £15 million in assets already secured on-chain. Converting to dollars at current exchange rates gives approximately $19 million in collateral backing the protocol before the presale completes. If the presale reaches its $100 million target, the ratio of raised capital to existing collateral will be roughly 5 to 1. This means the project would need to deploy the raised funds into new loans relatively quickly to maintain proportional backing.</p><p>\\\nThe staking rewards of 8 to 12% APR paid in USDT require generating sufficient revenue from loan interest and fees. If the protocol charges borrowers 7 to 15% annual interest, as stated in marketing materials, the math works if the majority of loans perform and default rates remain low. However, a 10% default rate combined with recovery costs could quickly consume the margin between what borrowers pay and what stakers receive.</p><p>\\\nThe tokenomics allocate 15% of supply for staking rewards. With 1 billion total tokens, this equals 150 million tokens reserved for rewards. If tokens reach $1 at TGE as the presale structure suggests, that represents $150 million in value designated for staking. Paying 12% APR on a pool of staked tokens would require substantial protocol revenue, meaning the loan book must grow significantly to sustain these yields.</p><h2>The Bigger Picture: Does ReFi Have Product-Market Fit?</h2><p>The core question is whether blockchain-based real estate financing solves problems that matter to enough participants to create a sustainable market. Developers need capital, and investors want returns. Traditional systems provide both, albeit with friction from intermediaries, paperwork, and slow processes.</p><p>\\\nBlockchain's value proposition centers on disintermediation, transparency, and global access. By removing middlemen, protocols can theoretically offer borrowers lower rates and investors higher yields. By recording transactions on-chain, all parties can audit the state of loans in real-time. By operating globally, capital can flow from anywhere to anywhere, removing geographical barriers.</p><p>\\\nThe counterargument is that the friction in traditional finance exists for reasons. Paperwork and slow processes often serve as risk management mechanisms that prevent bad deals from proceeding. Intermediaries like banks provide expertise in underwriting, legal structuring, and recovery that algorithmic systems may struggle to replicate. Global capital flows sound attractive until investors face losses in foreign jurisdictions where recovering assets is difficult or impossible.</p><p>After examining the available information about Construct Koin, the project represents both the promise and peril of real-world asset tokenization in its current phase. The promise lies in the genuine growth of the RWA sector, which has demonstrated that certain use cases have found product-market fit. The peril comes from execution risk, regulatory uncertainty, and the long history of crypto projects that fail to deliver on ambitious visions.</p><p>\\\nThe data points to consider are straightforward. The RWA market is real and growing, reaching $30 billion with institutional participation from major financial players. Real estate represents the largest asset class globally at over $300 trillion, meaning even a tiny percentage of tokenization would create enormous value. The technology for tokenizing loans and managing them through smart contracts exists and has been deployed by other projects successfully.</p><p>\\\nAgainst this, the presale model concentrates risk on early participants who must wait 12 to 24 months for tokens to unlock while hoping the project executes. The team, while public, does not appear to have prior experience building DeFi protocols or managing large-scale lending operations. The AI claims lack substantiation through independent testing or published benchmarks. The regulatory landscape remains fluid, with governments still determining how to classify and regulate tokenized assets.</p><p>\\\nThe honest assessment is that Construct Koin is attempting something difficult that, if successful, could generate returns for early participants. It is also attempting something that could fail for multiple reasons including poor execution, regulatory intervention, lack of borrower adoption, or macroeconomic changes that reduce demand for real estate development financing. Potential participants should view this as a high-risk investment where capital loss is a realistic outcome, not merely a theoretical possibility disclosed in legal disclaimers.</p><p>\\\nThe project would benefit from greater transparency about its AI technology, more detailed disclosure of its existing loan book, and clearer communication about partnerships with developers who will actually use the platform. Without these elements, investors are essentially betting on a vision backed by marketing materials rather than proven operational metrics.</p><p>\\\nIn a market where over half of projects fail, the bar for success is high. Whether Construct Koin clears that bar will depend on execution over the coming years, not on the quality of its presale marketing or the size of its fundraising target.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story!</p><p>:::tip\n<em>This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

One coating made from a porous film, which can be painted on to existing roofs, works by reflecting 96% of incoming solar radiation, rather than absorbing the sun's energy. It also has a high thermal emittance, meaning it effectively dissipates heat to outer space when the sky is clear. Its properties are known as passive radiative cooling. [...]\n \nIn a study, published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the researchers tested a prototype for six months on the roof of the Sydney Nanoscience Hub, pairing the cool paint with a UV-resistant topcoat that encouraged dew droplets to roll down into a receptacle. As much as 390 milliliters per sq meter per day could be collected for about a third of the year, the scientists found. Based on that water capture rate, an average Australian roof -- about 200 sq meters -- could provide up to 70 liters on days favorable for collecting dew, they estimate. [...]\n \nIn well-insulated buildings, a 6C decrease in roof temperature \"might result in a smaller fraction of that cooling being reflected in the top level of the house,\" [said the study's lead author, Prof Chiara Neto of the University of Sydney], but greater temperature reductions would be expected in most Australian houses, \"where insulation is quite poor.\" She said the coating could also help reduce the urban heat island effect, in which hard surfaces absorb more heat than natural surfaces, resulting in urban centers being 1C to 13C warmer than rural areas. The researchers found that the prototype coating was comprised of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene), which is used in the building industry but was \"not a scalable technology going forward\" due to its environmental issues. However, they are now commercializing a water-based paint with similar performance that is affordable and environmentally safer, costing about the same as standard premium paints.","contentLength":2194,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How a Chorus of Synchronized Frequencies Helps You Digest Your Food","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/0037250/how-a-chorus-of-synchronized-frequencies-helps-you-digest-your-food?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761904800,"author":"BeauHD","guid":102753,"unread":true,"content":"alternative_right shares a report from Phys.org: It is known in the scientific community that if you have a self-sustained oscillation, such as an arteriole, and you add an external stimulus at a similar but not identical frequency, you can lock the two, meaning you can shift the frequency of the oscillator to that of the external stimulus. In fact, it has been shown that if you connect two clocks, they will eventually synchronize their ticking. Distinguished Professor of Physics and Neurobiology David Kleinfeld found that if he applied an external stimulus to a neuron, the entire vasculature would lock at the same frequency. However, if he stimulated two sets of neurons at two different frequencies, something unexpected happened: some arterioles would lock at one frequency and others would lock at another frequency, forming a staircase effect.\n \nSearching for an explanation, Kleinfeld enlisted the help of his colleague, Professor of Physics Massimo Vergassola, who specializes in understanding the physics of living systems, and then recruited Ecole Normale Superieure graduate student Marie Sellier-Prono and Senior Researcher at the Institute for Complex Systems Massimo Cencini. Together, the researchers found they could use a classical model of coupled oscillators with an intestinal twist. The gut oscillates naturally due to peristalsis -- the contracting and relaxing of muscles in the digestive tract -- and provided a simplified model over the complex network of blood vessels in the brain. The intestine is unidirectional, meaning frequencies shift in one direction in a gradient from higher to lower. This is what enables food to move in one direction from the beginning of the small intestine to the end of the large intestine.\n \n\"Coupled oscillators talk to each other and each section of the intestine is an oscillator that talks to the other sections near it,\" stated Vergassola. \"Normally, coupled oscillators are studied in a homogeneous setting, meaning all the oscillators are at more or less similar frequencies. In our case, the oscillators were more varied, just as in the intestine and the brain.\" In studying the coupled oscillators in the gut, past researchers observed that there is indeed a staircase effect where similar frequencies lock onto those around it, allowing for the rhythmic movement of food through the digestive tract. But the height of the rises or breaks, the length of the stair runs or frequencies, and the conditions under which the staircase phenomenon occurred -- essential features of biological systems -- was something which had not been determined until now. The findings have been published in the journal Physical Review Letters.","contentLength":2699,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Aembit Introduces Identity And Access Management For Agentic AI","url":"https://hackernoon.com/aembit-introduces-identity-and-access-management-for-agentic-ai?source=rss","date":1761901555,"author":"CyberNewswire","guid":102784,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Silver Spring, USA/ Maryland, October 30th, 2025/CyberNewsWire/-- today announced the launch of Aembit Identity and Access Management (IAM) for Agentic AI, a set of capabilities that help organizations safely provide and enforce access policies for AI agents as they move into production. </p><p>The release introduces Blended Identity, which defines how AI agents act on behalf of verified users, and the MCP Identity Gateway, which ensures secure access to enterprise resources based on identity, access policy, and runtime attributes.</p><p>The new offering extends the Aembit Workload IAM Platform to address one of the most pressing operational questions in artificial intelligence and modern IT: how to control what autonomous and user-driven AI agents can access, under what conditions, and with what accountability.</p><p>AI agents are rapidly becoming a key part of enterprise operations. Nearly half of technology executives say they are already adopting or fully deploying agentic AI, and about the same share expect most of their AI deployments to be autonomous within two years, according to an . These agents retrieve sensitive data, open tickets, and execute code across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.</p><p>Yet most access models were built for people, not self-directed software. Many still rely on static secrets and shared credentials, creating risk and obscuring accountability. </p><p>Worse yet, agents’ actions are often hidden behind the identity of a human, making it almost impossible to audit the actions each actor has taken. The result is a widening gap between the pace of AI adoption and the ability of organizations to secure it with confidence.</p><p> assigns each agent a cryptographically verified identity, issues ephemeral credentials, and enforces policy at runtime. The system records every access decision and maintains attribution across both human-driven and autonomous agent activity. </p><p>By bringing agent activity under the same centralized policy control plane that governs other workloads, Aembit enables enterprises to deploy AI at scale while maintaining control, auditability, and compliance.</p><blockquote><p>“Enterprises want to say yes to agentic AI, and they’re asking Aembit for ways to securely grant agents access to data and applications,” said David Goldschlag, co-founder and CEO of Aembit. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Aembit IAM for Agentic AI gives enterprises the same level of control and audit over agent access that IAM systems have long provided for employees. Our approach enables organizations to advance their AI initiatives without expanding their threat and risk surface.”</p></blockquote><p>The release introduces two core capabilities to the Aembit Workload IAM Platform:</p><ul><li>Blended Identity, which gives every AI agent its own verified identity and, when needed, binds it to the human it represents. This establishes a single, traceable identity for each agent action and allows Aembit to issue a secure credential that reflects that combined context.</li><li>MCP Identity Gateway, which receives that identity credential and controls how agents connect to tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The gateway authenticates the agent, enforces policy, and performs token exchange to securely retrieve the necessary access permissions for each connected resource – without ever exposing them to the agent runtime.</li></ul><p>Together, this functionality allows enterprises to apply least-privilege access, revoke permissions immediately when needed, and ensure that every AI action is attributable and auditable. </p><p>They operate on Aembit’s established Workload IAM foundation, which enforces policy dynamically at runtime, issues ephemeral credentials just in time, and records structured events for full traceability.</p><p>Aembit developed IAM for Agentic AI through collaboration with large businesses, government organizations, and innovative agentic AI startups deploying AI for operational and security workloads. Those efforts helped shape an approach that combines enterprise enforcement with the adaptability AI projects demand.</p><blockquote><p>“AI agents don’t live inside one stack or trust domain,” said Kevin Sapp, co-founder and CTO of Aembit. “They move between hybrid environments in seconds. With Aembit, every agent carries a verified identity that our gateway can authenticate and control in real time. It’s how enterprises can give agents the access they need to work, while never losing sight of who they are or what they touch.”</p></blockquote><p>Aembit IAM for Agentic AI is now available to customers using its Workload IAM Platform.

It is a surprisingly hard problem and I want to talk about some of the issues we faced.</p><p>What about the Open Source that UK Government ?</p><p>Open Source is facing a crisis. The code that the world relies on is often developed by underpaid engineers on the brink of burn-out.  While I don't think anyone wants Open Source to have a paywall, it seems obvious that large organisation should pay their way and not rely solely on volunteer labour.</p><p>Here are some of the problems I faced when trying to get the UK Government to pay for OSS and how  as a maintainer can help make it easier for large organisations to pay you.</p><p>Firstly, lots of OSS doesn't have a well defined owner; so who gets the money?</p><p>I'm not saying that every little library you create needs to be published by a registered company, nor am I suggesting that you should remove your anonymity. But Governments and other organisations need to know  they are funding and  the money is going. The danger of accidentally funnelling money to a sanctioned state or person is just too big a risk for most organisations.</p><p>If you want to receive funding - make it  clear who you are.</p><p>Even when there is an owner, there often isn't an easy mechanism for paying people. Donation sites like GitHub Sponsors, Ko-Fi, and Patreon are great for individuals who want to throw a small amount of money to creators but they can be problematic for larger organisations.  Many OSS projects get around this by offering support contracts. It makes it much easier for an organisation to justify their spend because they're no longer donating to something which can be obtained for free; they're paying for a service.</p><p>This doesn't have to be a contract offering a 24/7 response and guaranteed SLA. It can be as simple as offering best-effort email support.</p><p>The important thing is to offer an  way for a larger organisation to buy your services. Many organisations have corporate credit cards for lower-cost discretionary spending which doesn't require a full business-case.  How easily could a manager buy a £500 support contact from your site?</p><p>Maintainers don't only have to offer support contracts. Many choose to offer training packages which are a good way to raise money  get more people using your product. Some project maintainers will speak at your conference for a suitable fee.</p><p>Again, the aim here is for maintainers to offer a  reason for a payment to be made.</p><p>Open Source has a brilliant culture of allowing multiple (often anonymous) contributors. That's fine when there's no money involved, but how does a moderately sized project decide who receives what share of the funding? Services like <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/\">OpenCollective</a> can make it easier to show  the money is going but it is better to discuss in advance with all contributors what they expect as a share.</p><p>If people think they're being taken advantage of, or that a project maintainer is unjustly enriching themselves, it can cause arguments.  Be very clear to contributors what the funding is for and whether they're entitled to any of it.</p><p>Finally, we faced the issue that some OSS projects didn't  to take money from the \"big bad state\". They were worried that if people saw \"Sponsored by the Government\" they would assume that there were backdoors for spies, or that the developer might give in to pressure to add unwanted features.  This (usually) isn't the case but it is easy to see why having a single large organisation as the main donor could give the impression of impropriety.</p><p>The best defence against this is to have  of paying sponsors! Having the state as one of many partners makes it clear that a project isn't beholden to any one customer.</p><p>It isn't impossible to get Governments to spend on Open Source. But state spending is heavily scrutinised and, bluntly, they aren't set up to pay  amounts to non-suppliers, who aren't charging money.  While large projects often have the resources to apply for Government grants and contracts, smaller projects rarely have the time or expertise. It is critical that maintainers remove the barriers which make it too hard for organisations to pay them.</p><ul><li><p>Make it easy for Governments and other large organisations to pay you.</p></li><li><p>Be as obvious as possible that you are able to accept payments from them.</p></li><li><p>Don't be afraid to put a large price on your talents.</p></li><li><p>Offer multiple paid-for options like speaker fees, support, and feature development funding.</p></li><li><p>Talk with your contributors to let them know how any funding will be shared.</p></li></ul>","contentLength":4568,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Empowering Flink CDC: Schema Evolution Support Lands in Apache SeaTunnel","url":"https://hackernoon.com/empowering-flink-cdc-schema-evolution-support-lands-in-apache-seatunnel?source=rss","date":1761894481,"author":"William Guo","guid":102782,"unread":true,"content":"<article>From classroom to codebase!

AI isn’t the disaster — it’s the&nbsp;&nbsp;for the disaster.</p><p>Look at the chart below.&nbsp;<strong>This is your American Horror Story in three acts:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Solo AI vendors promise revolutionary decision-making. Fortune 500 CEOs, hypnotized by NVIDIA’s stock price and OpenAI’s demos, write checks their companies can’t cash.</p><p>&nbsp;That red line? That’s $500 billion annually achieving -45% ROI (<em>Return on Investment — how much you get back compared to what you spend</em>). Not a typo.&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-five percent. Companies are paying premium prices to make&nbsp;&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;. It’s like hiring McKinsey to tell you what you already know,&nbsp;<em>except McKinsey occasionally delivers positive value.</em></p><p>&nbsp;Nobody admits failure. The AI system becomes “strategic infrastructure.” The losses get buried in “digital transformation.” The vendors —&nbsp;, the whole choir — keep singing about the future while cashing checks in the present.</p><p><strong>Remember the California Gold Rush from the history books?</strong>&nbsp;You know who got rich in 1849. Not the miners. The pickaxe sellers.</p><p>==Today’s pickaxe merchants sell GPU clusters and API tokens to CEOs panning for digital gold.==&nbsp;They whisper sweet promises: “<em>AI will revolutionize your business.</em>” What they don’t mention is that graph showing AI&nbsp;<em>never achieves positive ROI for operational decisions</em>.</p><p>Instead they boast about having more billion parameters than the competition’s AI monster. Of course theirs is bigger, more insanely convoluted — an expanding minefield of compounding errors,&nbsp;&nbsp;each cascade multiplying the disaster.</p><p>Meanwhile, see that green line in the chart above — simple algorithms from 1913 — keeps printing money at 1200% ROI. But nobody’s selling conferences about the Economic Order Quantity formula. There’s no TED talk about Little’s Law and the other older algorithms.</p><p>Yep, unfortunately you can’t raise billions in funding rounds by selling an algorithm that fits on a napkin from that expensive restaurant where you’re shaking hands with investors interested in a bigger AI beast.🤔</p><p>The tragedy is more nuanced than AI sellers admit — and more complex than CEOs with their broken quarterly-profit-maximization algorithms want to hear.</p><blockquote><p>Yes, there’s a hybrid approach where AI becomes just one component alongside those ancient algorithms when complexity grows. But that requires two things the AI revolution explicitly avoids:</p></blockquote><p><strong>==First, you need to understand your business==</strong>&nbsp;==from the molecular level to the stratosphere — every intricacy of your model, what you’re actually selling versus what you think you’re selling, where costs hide, where value emerges. These insights come from human minds. AI won’t solve what you can’t articulate, despite the sales pitch.==</p><p><strong>==Second, you need to hire and respect professional==</strong>==s who combine programming excellence with mathematical rigor and the rare ability to translate both into business value. But your AI recruiting system will never surface these people.==&nbsp;It’s optimized for commodities, not talent — screening for keywords, not capability.</p><p>Look at the carnage in the table below (Chart 3) . This isn’t speculation — it’s documented history:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Running on a decision that fits on an index card. Investment: approximately zero. Return: Industry dominance for four decades.</li><li>&nbsp;The crown jewel of&nbsp;. Investment: $4 billion. Return: Sold for parts at a 95% loss.</li><li>&nbsp;One simple rule about load factors. Still the only major US airline to avoid bankruptcy.</li><li>&nbsp;Cutting-edge AI pricing models. Burned $500 million in one quarter before shutting down entirely.</li></ul><p><strong>The only success story with AI? Amazon’s hybrid approach</strong>&nbsp;— yup, not pure AI, it’s old-school EOQ with some ML sprinkled on top when absolutely necessary. Even then, the ROI is a fraction of what simple algorithms achieve alone.</p><p>But let’s be honest here, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater: when your business complexity genuinely grows — meaning the actual number of variables you must account for — you need more flexibility. That might be AI/ML, or more likely, it’s just good programmers who understand your business and can architect the math you actually need.</p><p>Here’s what 20 years in the trenches taught most of us: around 90% of “complex” business problems can be solved by a competent programmer with decent math skills and simple algorithms, properly wired together.</p><p>Occam’s Razor still cuts: The simplest solution that works is usually right.</p><p>==But simplicity doesn’t sell conference tickets. Simplicity doesn’t raise Series B funding. Simplicity doesn’t get you on the cover of Wired. 😂==</p><p>So instead, companies take the lazy, prestigious route: throw their problems at whatever AI the vendors are pushing this quarter. It’s like hiring a top surgeon to apply a Band-Aid — expensive, unnecessary, and probably going to make things worse.</p><p>The real tragedy? That competent programmer with the simple solution costs $150K/year. The AI system that fails costs $15M. But the programmer doesn’t come with a sales team, a PowerPoint deck, or a promise to “transform your digital future.”</p><p>Guess which one the board approves.</p><h2>The Seven Heroes of Business History</h2><p>Our position shouldn’t surprise you by now, dear reader. We’re betting on what’s worked brilliantly for decades through every crisis, disaster, and market shift while delivering massive profits:&nbsp;</p><p>The formula is simple: Hire, value, and respect your best asset —&nbsp;. Add modern cloud infrastructure and, when genuinely appropriate (maybe 5–10% of cases), deploy the hybrid Algorithm + AI/ML approach.</p><p>But let’s be clear: forget the magic they’re selling — the fantasy of throwing data at AI and getting perfect solutions every time. That’s not happening.</p><p>Yes, LLMs are useful as search tools, data navigators, even coding assistants. But they’re far from autonomous. In non-trivial cases, you need spend lot of time cross-referencing to catch their false positives and, worse, the errors nobody notices —&nbsp;&nbsp;that spaghettify and collide concepts into dangerous nonsense.</p><h3>Meet the Magnificent Seven</h3><p><strong>More than 500 years of combined service. Trillions in value created. Under 1K lines of code total.</strong></p><p>Look at this table (Chart 4). These seven algorithms have never failed. For decades — in some cases over a century — they’ve consistently delivered business value to most of mankind. The epitome of simplicity.</p><p>\\\nEach one is a specialist with embarrassingly simple code:</p><ul><li>EOQ (1913): The inventory gunslinger - Square root of (2 × demand × order cost / holding cost). One line. Tells you exactly how much to order.</li><li>DuPont (1920): The financial sharpshooter - ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage. Three numbers multiplied. Instant diagnosis of what’s broken.</li><li>Newsvendor (1950s): The perishables ranger - Order up to the point where the&nbsp;&nbsp;matches the&nbsp;<strong>cost of running short vs. overstocking</strong>. A single threshold for “how much to make.”</li><li>Kelly (1956): The risk-sizing marshal - Bet a&nbsp;<strong>fraction of your bankroll</strong>&nbsp;based on&nbsp;&nbsp;— when your advantage is bigger, size up; when it’s small, size down. Never overbet.</li><li>CPM (1957): The project management tracker - Find the longest path through your network. That’s your deadline. Everything else can slip; this can’t.</li><li>Little’s Law (1961): The operations enforcer - Items in system = arrival rate × time in system. It’s physics, not statistics. Works for everything.</li><li>PageRank (1998): The young gun who built an empire - A page’s importance is the&nbsp;<strong>sum of votes from important pages</strong>, each vote&nbsp;, with a small&nbsp;&nbsp;factor to keep it stable. Keep iterating. Built Google.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong><em>Total code for all seven: comfortably &lt;1K lines. The math that runs the world fits in a single GitHub gist.</em></strong></p><p>Is a programming career still viable? Looking at this table — absolutely. Learning algorithms and programming built the past and will build the future, despite this transient AI-hypnotized present.</p></blockquote><p>The AI hype has its place — pattern finding, searching, identifying. But it needs years of improvement to correct its statistical errors from Type I through IV. Even then, algorithms in the hands of competent developers remain irreplaceable and far from commodities.</p><p>&nbsp;While everyone chases AI complexity, these seven simple formulas keep generating thousands of percent returns. They don’t need updates. They don’t hallucinate. They just work.</p><p>That’s not outdated. That’s immortal. Let’s keep programming with algorithms while the true researchers work on fixing AI errors with better math.</p>","contentLength":8955,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SpaceX: Starship Will Be Going To the Moon, With Or Without NASA","url":"https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/0045236/spacex-starship-will-be-going-to-the-moon-with-or-without-nasa?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761894000,"author":"BeauHD","guid":102623,"unread":true,"content":"schwit1 shares a report from Behind the Black: SpaceX is going to land this spaceship manned on the Moon, whether or not NASA's SLS and Orion are ready.

Here's the section where SpaceX \"made it clear that it sees Starship and Superheavy as its own space effort, irrelevant of NASA\": \"To return Americans to the Moon, SpaceX aligned Starship development along two paths: development of the core Starship system and supporting infrastructure, including production facilities, test facilities, and launch sites -- which SpaceX is self-funding representing over 90% of system costs -- and development of the HLS-specific Starship configuration, which leverages and modifies the core vehicle capability to support NASA's requirements for landing crew on and returning them from the Moon. SpaceX is working under a fixed-price contract with NASA, ensuring that the company is only paid after the successful completion of progress milestones, and American taxpayers are not on the hook for increased SpaceX costs. SpaceX provides significant insight to NASA at every stage of the development process along both paths, including access to flight data from missions not funded under the HLS contract.\n \nBoth pathways are necessary and made possible by SpaceX's substantial self-investments to enable the high-rate production, launch, and test of Starship for missions to the Moon and other purposes. Starship will bring the United States back to the Moon before any other nation and it will enable sustainable lunar operations by being fully and rapidly reusable, cost-effective, and capable of high frequency lunar missions with more than 100 tons of cargo capacity.\"","contentLength":2068,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Road to Hell is Paved with Good DRY Intentions","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-dry-intentions?source=rss","date":1761893629,"author":"Melvin Kosisochukwu","guid":102779,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have come across my share of beautifully written, over-engineered code… one moment I am thinking “That is an interesting way to do that” and the next minute you are wondering “what the hell is going on here!”. I have also suffered from writing over-engineered code, where you are thinking so far into the future that you compromise . The  (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) principle is a good way to counter over-engineering: functionalities should only be implemented when you need them, not on the possibility that you will need them. I have mentioned over-engineering a couple of times now, and some of you reading this are probably thinking What is over-engineering?</p><p>In very simple terms, over-engineering is making software/system design more complex than necessary; this usually happens because you want to add extra functionality to your component to simplify the implementation of A, only to add the functionality for B later.</p><p>We have this codebase for managing invitations; it’s an inherited, legacy codebase with technical debt that accrues interest. The more you try to work on the legacy code, the more something somewhere else breaks. You have to revert in most cases and start all over. Working around the legacy code ends up accruing interest on the technical debt; it’s a standoff between risking breaking features all over the app or adding more technical debt to the codebase. The third solution we came up with was abstraction. We had to figure out ways to modularise new features or improvements to the application, and to expose and share data where necessary. At first, this seemed like a Hail Mary. Finally, we can work on this mangled codebase with minimal side effects. Were we wrong!! The abstraction spiraled, and the codebase ended up overabstracted, bloating the solution to the problem and bringing the supposed salvaged side of the codebase into its own hell. Along the line, we forgone the rules for the abstraction and now have different parts of the application dependent on each other, looping back to where we started. I suppose this was bound to happen in a codebase with a couple of developers, each with fire up their asses to ship features; we ended up shipping maintenance and more technical debt.</p><p>When collaborating with multiple people on a codebase (which is pretty much always the case), and for corporates who are more interested in shipping features than code quality, code reviews always suffer. For problems like over-engineering and overabstraction, Traditional line-by-line code reviews often miss these systematic issues. You check a component created a couple of weeks ago to support the integration of a feature, following the DRY principle, and realize there are now 10 interconnected/similar features that depend on the component. Code reviews will need to be elevated to catch these architectural issues and ensure that dependency requirements between components are met.</p><p>We live by the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) gospel because it simplifies work, and developers are inherently lazy (in a good way). The DRY principle works well with orthogonal systems: small, self-contained components combined to form a system.</p><p><em>Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of each other</em>.</p><p>There should be more emphasis on orthogonal systems and on DRY code; it’s easier to combine the reusable functions you create with each other and scale them as the repository progresses when they are not bloated and overabstracted, at which point you end up with a rigid system interwoven so much with each other that it will be complicated to connect which aspects of the code that does not meet an exact rule, you will find yourself duplicating the code because making it work for a new connection breaks an old system. Congratulations, you have achieved Spaghetti code that cannot bend. To use a truly orthogonal system and avoid spaghetti DRY code, every code module change should affect only the module that is updated.</p><p>Your components should not focus solely on avoiding repetition, but also on being small abstractions of the overall system; otherwise, you will end up with components so complex that they can easily break with a single change to a connected component. When creating reusable code, the approach should be writing code that does not depend on any other code block to function a certain way. Reusability should be used as a tool and not the goal; when you have reusable UI components with business or API logic in the same component, you are on a highway to over-abstraction. It starts small, and before you realize what is happening, the disease has festered throughout your repository. Now you cannot reuse the component on a different page with the same UI functions and different logic without adding additional external logic/context to the component.</p><h2>Modularity Modularity Modularity</h2><p>Modularity involves breaking your system down into smaller, independent codes/components called modules. Please pay attention to the word ‘smaller’; it’s possible to have a bloated module with more code than necessary, which creates over-abstraction and should be avoided. Over-abstraction is really just an unsuccessful attempt at modularity. Your modules should be able to function independently of other modules, only exposing required data. Changes to good, modular, structured code should affect only the modules, without any cascading effects.</p><p>A good approach to building orthogonal systems and easily avoiding over-abstraction is to build with functionality first, then features; this aligns well with Component-Based architecture(separating UI components from stateful components). The functionality stage will focus on the smallest reusable units of code that are assembled to implement the feature. A Login feature will consist of the following functions: collect username and password (UI), validate user data, redirect to the user profile/reject collected user data. Each functionality should operate independently, relying only on necessary data.</p><h2>No medals for over-sophisticated code</h2><p>After writing every code implementation, ask yourself whether there is an easier or simpler way to achieve the same result. Most of us have heard stories about code that can be edited or worked on by only one person in the company, which is not a feat to be proud of. Writing code that can only be maintained by you most likely means it’s over-sophisticated or employs unorthodox procedures. A great example of coding using unorthodox procedures is Gilfoyle’s Hard Drives from the article: &nbsp;</p><p>I have found myself writing overly sophisticated code because I want to use a new technology/package/library I just learned about, without considering whether it is the simplest tool for the job. The excitement for learning something new is great, but attention to when and where it should be applied is probably more important.</p><p>In the quest for writing perfect codes that account for all possible future and time-travelling cases, you end up with an over-engineered codebase. You should give it up because it is not possible to write perfect code, aim for good enough that meets all your immediate requirements. The DRY principle is fundamental; repetition is still a sin in software development. The DRY principle should be applied to an orthogonal system to create a codebase that is decoupled, with each module independent and exchanging data at a separate meeting point(feature module). These will help you create systems that are easy to maintain and debug. Remember that simple is always better in software development.</p>","contentLength":7639,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Part 1:Building Your First Video Pipeline: FFmpeg & MediaMTX Basics","url":"https://hackernoon.com/part-1building-your-first-video-pipeline-ffmpeg-and-mediamtx-basics?source=rss","date":1761893499,"author":"Samuel Olamide","guid":102778,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Imagine this: You're tasked with building a web application that displays live video feeds from security cameras, IoT devices, or webcams. Simple enough, right? You quickly discover that while HTML5 video works great for pre-recorded content, the world of real-time streaming is a maze of protocols, codecs, and compatibility issues that can turn a very \"simple\" feature into weeks of frustration.</p><p>The core problem is interestingly simple: <strong>cameras speak RTSP, but browsers don't</strong>. Most IP cameras and professional video equipment use RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) to broadcast their feeds. That's because it's reliable, has low latency, and is perfect for direct connections. But when you try to display that same stream in a web browser, you hit a wall. Modern browsers have dropped RTSP support entirely for security reasons since around 2010-2015, leaving developers scrambling for solutions.</p><p><em>This is where the magic happens.</em></p><p>, the Swiss Army knife of video processing, and , a modern streaming server that acts as a universal translator between different video protocols. Together, they form the backbone of countless video applications, from Netflix's encoding pipeline to your local security system's web interface.</p><p>In this series, we are going to build a complete, production-ready video streaming pipeline from the ground up. By the end of this first article, you'll have a live webcam feed streaming directly in your browser with remarkably low latency. Let's dive in.</p><h3>FFmpeg: The Universal Video Swiss Army Knife</h3><p>FFmpeg is arguably one of the most important pieces of software you've never heard of. It powers video processing in applications ranging from VLC media player to professional broadcast systems. At its core, FFmpeg is a command-line tool that can read virtually any video or audio format and convert it to virtually any other format.</p><p>The FFmpeg workflow follows a predictable pattern:</p><ul><li> Separating video and audio streams from container formats</li><li> Converting compressed data into raw video frames and audio samples</li><li> Applying transformations like scaling, cropping, or color correction</li><li> Compressing the processed data using codecs like H.264 or VP9</li><li> Packaging the encoded streams into output containers</li></ul><p>For our streaming pipeline, FFmpeg will serve as the ingestion engine. It will capture video from sources like webcams or files, encode it efficiently, and push it to our streaming server using protocols like RTSP or RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol).</p><p>While FFmpeg excels at processing video, it cannot serve multiple clients simultaneously. That's where MediaMTX comes in. MediaMTX is a modern, lightweight streaming server that acts as a universal media gateway.</p><p>Think of MediaMTX as a protocol translator and traffic manager:</p><ul><li>It accepts incoming streams via RTSP, RTMP, WebRTC, or HLS</li><li>It can re-package those streams into different formats for different clients</li><li>It handles authentication, load balancing, and client management</li><li>Most importantly for web developers, it can serve RTSP streams as WebRTC, making them accessible to browsers</li></ul><p>The beauty of MediaMTX lies in its simplicity. A single binary with a YAML configuration file can handle complex streaming scenarios that would require multiple specialized servers in traditional setups.</p><p>Before we start building, let's get our tools installed.</p><p><em>As of the time of writing this article, the latest ffmpeg release is v8.0, and that is what I will be using.</em></p><pre><code>sudo apt-update\nsudo apt install autoconf automake build-essential pkg-config libx264-dev libvpx-dev libfdk-aac-dev\n\ngit clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git ffmpeg\n\ncd ffmpeg\n\n./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree\n\nmake -j$(nproc)\n\nmake install\n</code></pre><h4>On MacOS (using Homebrew):</h4><ol><li>Extract the downloaded zip file to </li><li>You should see folders like , , etc.</li></ol><ol><li>Press  R, type , press Enter</li><li>Click  tab → </li><li>Under , find and select </li></ol><p>You should see version information and a list of supported codecs and formats.</p><p><em>As of the time of writing this article, the latest ffmpeg release is v1.15.0, and that is what I will be using.</em></p><p>MediaMTX distributes as a single binary, making installation straightforward:</p><h4>MacOS and Linux Installation:</h4><pre><code># Download and extract (replace 'linux' with 'darwin' for MacOS)\nwget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/latest/download/mediamtx_v1.15.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz\ntar -xzf mediamtx_v1.15.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz\n\n# Make executable and test\nchmod +x mediamtx\n\n# Add to system PATH\nsudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/\n\n# Run it to confirm installation\nmediamtx\n</code></pre><pre><code># Download and extract\ncurl -L -O https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/latest/download/mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64.tar.gz\n\n# Extract to mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64 folder\n\n# Test run\ncd mediamtx_v1.15.0_windows_amd64\n./mediamtx.exe\n\n# Add to PATH\nmkdir C:\\Users\\{YOUR_USER}\\bin\nMove-Item .\\mediamtx.exe C:\\Users\\{YOUR_USER}\\bin\\\n</code></pre><p>: Windows + R → ==sysdm.cpl== → Advanced → Environment Variables → System Variables → Path → Edit → New → Add </p><p> Windows Defender may flag the download - temporarily disable if needed.</p><p>When you run MediaMTX for the first time, you'll see output like:</p><p>\\\nMediaMTX is now running and ready to accept streams.</p><h2>Project 1: Streaming a Video File</h2><p>Let's start simple by streaming a video file. This simulates a live source and helps us understand the basic pipeline without the complexity of hardware interfaces.</p><p>First, create a basic MediaMTX configuration file. Create :</p><pre><code># Basic MediaMTX configuration\npaths:\n  test_video:\n    source: publisher\n</code></pre><p>This configuration creates a path called  that accepts published streams from any source.</p><p>Run mediamtx with the config file you created:</p><pre><code># In the directory you created the mediamtx.yml\nmediamtx mediamtx.yml\n</code></pre><p>Now, let's use FFmpeg to stream a video file to MediaMTX. You'll need a video file for testing. Any MP4, AVI, or MOV file will work:</p><pre><code>ffmpeg -re -i your_video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -c:a aac -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/test_video\n</code></pre><p>Let's break down this command:</p><ul><li>: Read input at its native frame rate (essential for live streaming)</li><li>: Input file</li><li>: Use H.264 video codec (widely compatible)</li><li>: Encoding speed vs. compression trade-off</li><li>: Use AAC audio codec</li><li>: Output format is RTSP</li><li><code>rtsp://localhost:8554/test_video</code>: Destination URL</li></ul><p>If everything works correctly, you'll see FFmpeg output showing frame processing statistics.</p><p>Open VLC Media Player and:</p><ol><li>Go to Media → Open Network Stream</li><li>Enter: <code>rtsp://localhost:8554/test_video</code></li></ol><p>You should see your video playing! This confirms that MediaMTX is receiving the stream from FFmpeg and serving it via RTSP.</p><h2>Project 2: Streaming a Webcam</h2><p>Now, let's capture something live. We'll stream directly from your webcam to create a real-time video feed.</p><p>First, let's add a new path in our mediamtx config:</p><pre><code># Basic MediaMTX configuration\npaths:\n  test_video:\n    source: publisher\n  webcam:\n    source: publisher\n</code></pre><p>Now we need to identify your webcam device:</p><pre><code># List video devices\nls /dev/video*\n\n# Usually /dev/video0 for the first webcam\n</code></pre><pre><code># List available devices\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i \"\"\n</code></pre><pre><code># List available devices\nffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy\n\n# OR\nGet-PnpDevice -Class Camera | Select-Object FriendlyName, Status\n</code></pre><p>You'll see output listing available cameras and microphones. Note the device index (usually 0 for the built-in camera).</p><p>Now, let's stream your webcam:</p><pre><code>ffmpeg -f dshow -rtbufsize 100M -i video=\"Integrated Webcam\" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam\n</code></pre><p>Let's break down this command:</p><ul><li> - Use DirectShow input format (Windows-specific for cameras/microphones)</li><li> - Set real-time buffer size to 100MB (prevents dropped frames)</li><li><code>-i video=\"Integrated Webcam\"</code> - Input source: video device named \"Integrated Webcam\"</li></ul><ul><li> - Video codec: use H.264 encoder</li><li> - Encoding preset: prioritize speed over compression quality</li><li> - Optimize encoding for real-time streaming (minimal buffering)</li><li> - Output format: Real Time Streaming Protocol</li><li><code>rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam</code> - Output destination: local RTSP server on port 8554, path \"/webcam\"</li></ul><pre><code>ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -video_size 1280x720 -i \"0\" -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam\n</code></pre><ul><li> - Use AVFoundation input format (macOS-specific for cameras/microphones)</li><li> - Capture at 30 frames per second</li><li> - Set capture resolution to 1280x720 (720p)</li><li> - Input source: device index 0 (first camera device)</li></ul><p> (same as Windows)</p><ul><li> - Video codec: H.264 encoder</li><li> - Fastest encoding preset</li><li> - Real-time streaming optimization</li><li> - RTSP output format</li><li><code>rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam</code> - RTSP server destination</li></ul><pre><code>ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -c:a aac -f rtsp rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam\n</code></pre><ul><li> - Use Video4Linux2 input format (Linux-specific for cameras)</li><li> - Input source: first video device in Linux (/dev/video0)</li></ul><ul><li> - Video codec: H.264 encoder</li><li> - Fastest encoding preset</li><li> - Real-time streaming optimization</li><li> - Audio codec: Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)</li><li> - RTSP output format</li><li><code>rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam</code> - RTSP server destination</li></ul><p> We're using the path  instead of . Test this stream in VLC using <code>rtsp://localhost:8554/webcam</code>. You should see your live webcam feed with minimal delay!</p><h2>Project 3: The Magic of WebRTC</h2><p>Here's where things get exciting. While RTSP works great for applications like VLC, it won't work in web browsers. But MediaMTX has a superpower: it can automatically convert RTSP streams to WebRTC, which browsers understand perfectly.</p><p>Let's enable WebRTC in MediaMTX. Update your  configuration:</p><pre><code># Basic MediaMTX configuration\nwebrtc: yes\nwebrtcAddress: :8889\nwebrtcEncryption: no\nwebrtcAllowOrigin: '*'\nwebrtcLocalUDPAddress: :8189\nwebrtcIPsFromInterfaces: yes\n\npaths:\n  test_video:\n    source: publisher\n  webcam:\n    source: publisher\n</code></pre><p>Restart MediaMTX with this new configuration and keep your webcam stream running with FFmpeg. Open your browser to <code>http://localhost:8889/webcam</code>. Your webcam feed should start playing directly in the browser.</p><p>This is the magic moment. You've just built a complete real-time video pipeline that captures live video, processes it, and delivers it to web browsers using modern WebRTC technology. The same architecture powers professional applications serving thousands of concurrent viewers.</p><h2>Understanding What Just Happened</h2><p>Let's trace the complete data flow:</p><ol><li>Your webcam produces raw video frames</li><li>FFmpeg captures these frames, encodes them as H.264, and streams them via RTSP to MediaMTX</li><li>MediaMTX receives the RTSP stream and makes it available on the  path</li><li>When a browser requests the stream via WebRTC, MediaMTX automatically converts the RTSP stream to WebRTC format</li><li>The browser receives WebRTC packets and renders them in real-time</li></ol><p>This pipeline is remarkably efficient because MediaMTX doesn't re-encode the video. It simply repackages the H.264 stream into different container formats for different protocols.</p><p>You've just built a foundational real-time video streaming pipeline. Let's recap what you've accomplished:</p><ul><li>Installed and configured FFmpeg and MediaMTX</li><li>Streamed a pre-recorded video file to simulate live content</li><li>Captured and streamed live video from your webcam</li><li>Enabled browser-based viewing using WebRTC</li><li>Created a low-latency video pipeline suitable for interactive applications</li></ul><p>This setup demonstrates the core concepts that power much larger streaming systems. The same pattern (capture, encode, serve) scales from single streams to thousands of concurrent feeds.</p><p>However, our current setup has some limitations that prevent it from being production-ready:</p><ul><li>No authentication or security measures</li><li>Can't handle real-world video sources like IP cameras</li><li>No monitoring or error handling</li></ul><p>In Part 2, we'll address these challenges by securing our pipeline, connecting to real IP cameras, and preparing our system for internet deployment. We'll explore authentication mechanisms, handle diverse video formats, and transform our localhost demo into a robust, secure streaming service.</p><p>The journey from \"works on my machine\" to \"production-ready\" is where the real engineering challenges begin and where the most interesting solutions emerge.</p><p>Ready to take your streaming pipeline to the next level?

We'll discuss the single responsibility principle, error handling, and why  is your best friend.</p><h2>Single Responsibility Principle: One Function — One Job</h2><p>Here's a typical function from a real project (names changed):</p><pre><code>// BAD: monster function does everything\nfunc ProcessUserData(userID int) (*User, error) {\n    // Validation\n    if userID &lt;= 0 {\n        log.Printf(\"Invalid user ID: %d\", userID)\n        return nil, errors.New(\"invalid user ID\")\n    }\n\n    // Database connection\n    db, err := sql.Open(\"postgres\", connString)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"DB connection failed: %v\", err)\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    defer db.Close()\n\n    var user User\n    err = db.QueryRow(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1\", userID).Scan(&amp;user.ID, &amp;user.Name, &amp;user.Email)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"Query failed: %v\", err)\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    // Data enrichment\n    if user.Email != \"\" {\n        domain := strings.Split(user.Email, \"@\")[1]\n        user.EmailDomain = domain\n\n        // Check corporate domain\n        corporateDomains := []string{\"google.com\", \"microsoft.com\", \"apple.com\"}\n        for _, corp := range corporateDomains {\n            if domain == corp {\n                user.IsCorporate = true\n                break\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Logging\n    log.Printf(\"User %d processed successfully\", userID)\n\n    return &amp;user, nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>This function violates SRP on multiple fronts:</p><ul><li>Manages database connections</li></ul><p>: A function should fit entirely on a developer's screen (roughly 30-50 lines). If you need to scroll — time to refactor.</p><p>Let's refactor following Go idioms:</p><pre><code>// GOOD: each function has one responsibility\nfunc GetUser(ctx context.Context, userID int) (*User, error) {\n    if err := validateUserID(userID); err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"validation failed: %w\", err)\n    }\n\n    user, err := fetchUserFromDB(ctx, userID)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"fetch user %d: %w\", userID, err)\n    }\n\n    enrichUserData(user)\n    return user, nil\n}\n\nfunc validateUserID(id int) error {\n    if id &lt;= 0 {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"invalid user ID: %d\", id)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc fetchUserFromDB(ctx context.Context, userID int) (*User, error) {\n    row := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, `\n        SELECT id, name, email \n        FROM users \n        WHERE id = $1`, userID)\n\n    var user User\n    if err := row.Scan(&amp;user.ID, &amp;user.Name, &amp;user.Email); err != nil {\n        if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {\n            return nil, ErrUserNotFound\n        }\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    return &amp;user, nil\n}\n\nfunc enrichUserData(user *User) {\n    if user.Email == \"\" {\n        return\n    }\n\n    parts := strings.Split(user.Email, \"@\")\n    if len(parts) != 2 {\n        return\n    }\n\n    user.EmailDomain = parts[1]\n    user.IsCorporate = isCorporateDomain(user.EmailDomain)\n}\n</code></pre><ul><li> (20 lines max)</li><li><strong>Has single responsibility</strong></li><li><strong>Can be tested independently</strong></li></ul><h2>Error Handling: The Go Way</h2><p>Beginners often create the \"pyramid of doom\":</p><pre><code>// BAD: deep nesting\nfunc SendNotification(userID int, message string) error {\n    user, err := GetUser(userID)\n    if err == nil {\n        if user.Email != \"\" {\n            if user.IsActive {\n                if user.NotificationsEnabled {\n                    err := smtp.Send(user.Email, message)\n                    if err == nil {\n                        log.Printf(\"Sent to %s\", user.Email)\n                        return nil\n                    } else {\n                        log.Printf(\"Failed to send: %v\", err)\n                        return err\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    return errors.New(\"notifications disabled\")\n                }\n            } else {\n                return errors.New(\"user inactive\")\n            }\n        } else {\n            return errors.New(\"email empty\")\n        }\n    } else {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"user not found: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Solution: Early Return (Guard Clauses)</h3><pre><code>// GOOD: early return on errors\nfunc SendNotification(userID int, message string) error {\n    user, err := GetUser(userID)\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"get user %d: %w\", userID, err)\n    }\n\n    if user.Email == \"\" {\n        return ErrEmptyEmail\n    }\n\n    if !user.IsActive {\n        return ErrUserInactive\n    }\n\n    if !user.NotificationsEnabled {\n        return ErrNotificationsDisabled\n    }\n\n    if err := smtp.Send(user.Email, message); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"send to %s: %w\", user.Email, err)\n    }\n\n    log.Printf(\"Notification sent to %s\", user.Email)\n    return nil\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Error Wrapping: Context Matters</h3><p>Since Go 1.13,  with the  verb wraps errors. Always use it:</p><pre><code>// Define sentinel errors for business logic\nvar (\n    ErrUserNotFound          = errors.New(\"user not found\")\n    ErrInsufficientFunds     = errors.New(\"insufficient funds\")\n    ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed = errors.New(\"order already processed\")\n)\n\nfunc ProcessPayment(orderID string) error {\n    order, err := fetchOrder(orderID)\n    if err != nil {\n        // Add context to the error\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"process payment for order %s: %w\", orderID, err)\n    }\n\n    if order.Status == \"processed\" {\n        return ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed\n    }\n\n    if err := chargeCard(order); err != nil {\n        // Wrap technical errors\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"charge card for order %s: %w\", orderID, err)\n    }\n\n    return nil\n}\n\n// Calling code can check error type\nif err := ProcessPayment(\"ORD-123\"); err != nil {\n    if errors.Is(err, ErrOrderAlreadyProcessed) {\n        // Business logic for already processed order\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    if errors.Is(err, ErrInsufficientFunds) {\n        // Notify user about insufficient funds\n        notifyUser(err)\n    }\n\n    // Log unexpected errors\n    log.Printf(\"Payment failed: %v\", err)\n    return err\n}\n</code></pre><h2>Defer: Guaranteed Resource Cleanup</h2><p> is one of Go's killer features. Use it for guaranteed cleanup:</p><pre><code>// BAD: might forget to release resources\nfunc ReadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {\n    file, err := os.Open(path)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    data, err := io.ReadAll(file)\n    if err != nil {\n        file.Close() // Easy to forget during refactoring\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    var config Config\n    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;config); err != nil {\n        file.Close() // Duplication\n        return nil, err\n    }\n\n    file.Close() // And again\n    return &amp;config, nil\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>// GOOD: defer guarantees closure\nfunc ReadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {\n    file, err := os.Open(path)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"open config %s: %w\", path, err)\n    }\n    defer file.Close() // Will execute no matter what\n\n    data, err := io.ReadAll(file)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"read config %s: %w\", path, err)\n    }\n\n    var config Config\n    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;config); err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"parse config %s: %w\", path, err)\n    }\n\n    return &amp;config, nil\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Pattern: Cleanup Functions</h3><pre><code>func WithTransaction(ctx context.Context, fn func(*sql.Tx) error) error {\n    tx, err := db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"begin transaction: %w\", err)\n    }\n\n    // defer executes in LIFO order\n    defer func() {\n        if p := recover(); p != nil {\n            tx.Rollback()\n            panic(p) // re-throw panic after cleanup\n        }\n\n        if err != nil {\n            tx.Rollback()\n        } else {\n            err = tx.Commit()\n        }\n    }()\n\n    err = fn(tx)\n    return err\n}\n\n// Usage\nerr := WithTransaction(ctx, func(tx *sql.Tx) error {\n    // All logic in transaction\n    // Rollback/Commit happens automatically\n    return nil\n})\n</code></pre><pre><code>// BAD: unclear purpose\nfunc Process(data []byte) error\nfunc Handle(r Request) Response\nfunc Do() error\n\n// GOOD: verb + noun\nfunc ParseJSON(data []byte) (*Config, error)\nfunc ValidateEmail(email string) error\nfunc SendNotification(user *User, msg string) error\n</code></pre><p>If more than 3-4 parameters — use a struct:</p><pre><code>// BAD: too many parameters\nfunc CreateUser(name, email, phone, address string, age int, isActive bool) (*User, error)\n\n// GOOD: group into struct\ntype CreateUserRequest struct {\n    Name     string\n    Email    string\n    Phone    string\n    Address  string\n    Age      int\n    IsActive bool\n}\n\nfunc CreateUser(req CreateUserRequest) (*User, error)\n</code></pre><pre><code>// BAD: boolean flags are unclear\nfunc CheckPermission(userID int) (bool, bool, error) // what does first bool mean? second?\n\n// GOOD: use named returns or struct\nfunc CheckPermission(userID int) (canRead, canWrite bool, err error)\n\n// BETTER: struct for complex results\ntype Permissions struct {\n    CanRead   bool\n    CanWrite  bool\n    CanDelete bool\n}\n\nfunc CheckPermission(userID int) (*Permissions, error)\n</code></pre><ul><li> (30-50 lines max)</li><li> (Single Responsibility)</li><li> (verb + noun)</li><li> for errors</li><li> with context ()</li><li> if can be cancelled</li><li> (or clearly documented)</li></ul><p>Clean functions in Go aren't just about following general Clean Code principles.

In reality, culture is a living, breathing force – the lifeblood of a company. It’s shaped most intensely by the  and the first handful of hires. I learned this the hard way: if you mess up culture in the first 10–20 people, everything else will suffer. A strong culture can propel a startup through challenges, while a weak or toxic culture can sink it before it scales. As Tony Hsieh of Zappos famously put it, “If you get the culture right, most of the other stuff will just happen on its own.” In this article, I’ll share lessons from my journey as a founder on building culture and practicing leadership that scales.</p><h2><strong>Founder’s Behavior Sets the Tone</strong></h2><p>I always start with  The founder’s behavior sets the example that everyone in the company will follow, consciously or not. How I respond under pressure, how I celebrate wins, or how I handle failures, all of it becomes a model for the team. You can write nice values on paper, but if your team sees the founder acting against those values, the words mean nothing. Leaders must  they want to see. Research confirms this: employees who trust their leaders (because leaders walk the talk) have higher job satisfaction and commitment. Jack Welch once said, <em>“Trust happens when leaders are transparent.”</em> Being open and honest as a leader builds credibility. If I stay calm during a crisis, ask for help when needed, or admit mistakes, I signal that these behaviors are part of our culture. Every decision and action from the top trickles down.</p><h2><strong>Hiring Early Team Members Wisely</strong></h2><p>In an early-stage startup, every hire is critical. The cliche “hire A-players” exists for a reason. Those first 10–20 people <strong>define your startup’s DNA</strong>. One wrong hire with a toxic attitude can undo months of hard work and poison the well. I call it the “one wolf can kill a hundred sheep” problem – one toxic person can destroy a positive team of dozens. This isn’t just anecdotal. A Harvard study found that avoiding a single toxic employee can save a company  as much money as hiring a superstar performer, once you factor in the damage toxic workers do to morale and productivity. In other words, <strong>one bad apple truly can spoil the bunch</strong>.</p><p>That’s why I personally interview almost everyone we hire in the early days. I look beyond skills and resume bullet points – I probe for attitude, adaptability, and cultural fit. One of my guiding principles: <em>“hire for character and potential, train for skill.”</em> You can teach someone to code in a new language, but you can’t easily teach humility, resilience, or integrity. Other founders echo this: . As investor Krishna Rangasayee notes, technical chops matter, but <em>“at the end of the day, you can teach skills… What you can't teach is how to fit into a culture.”</em> We prioritize candidates who align with our values and mission. Some people might look “average” on paper but have incredible growth potential and attitude – those are often the gems. Conversely, I’ve seen people with shiny CVs who brought subtle toxicity or ego that eroded teamwork.  if you must, but get those first hires right. It sets the foundation for everything. And if someone toxic does slip through, remove them quickly – the cost of keeping them is far higher than the cost of an empty seat.</p><h2>Transparent Leadership and Trust</h2><p>Leadership is about more than giving orders; it’s about . I’ve learned to be brutally transparent with my team about what’s happening, even when the news isn’t good. If revenue is down or a product launch fails, everyone knows the numbers and the situation. Why? Because people are smart – they will spot lies or half-truths a mile away, and nothing erodes trust faster than a feeling that leadership is hiding something. Conversely, <strong>honesty (even when uncomfortable)</strong> builds trust faster than any sugarcoating.</p><p>In our company, we practice open communication about wins and losses. When we miss a target, I explain why and what we’ll do next. When we land a big client, I share the details and credit the team. This creates a culture where news – good or bad – isn’t a taboo but something we tackle together. The payoff is a team that trusts leadership and feels invested. There’s research to back this up: employees who trust their leader are more committed and less likely to quit. Transparency is indeed a lifeline, especially as we embraced remote work (more on that soon). We’ve adopted rituals like weekly all-hands video calls, monthly updates on key metrics, and an open dashboard of our KPIs. By providing context and explaining decisions, I empower team members to make better choices on their own. In short, <strong>transparency breeds accountability and unity</strong>. It shows respect for your team’s intelligence and creates a shared reality where everyone is pulling in the same direction.</p><h2>Control vs. Empowerment: Real Leadership</h2><p>Many first-time founders (my past self included) confuse  with leadership. It’s tempting to micromanage every detail, thinking that if you’re involved in everything, nothing can go wrong. But true leadership is often the opposite: <strong>letting people own their work</strong> and stepping in only where you add value. Micromanagement is a trap that kills ownership and signals a lack of trust. It might satisfy your inner control freak, but it will demoralize your team and slow you down. As our company grew, I had to learn to <strong>stop steering every wheel</strong> and instead guide the ship by setting direction and context.</p><p>When you micromanage, you send a message that you don’t trust your team’s judgment. Over time, employees become disengaged and dependent, or they leave. Studies highlight this contrast: <em>“Micromanagement kills ownership and promotes a lack of trust. In contrast, empowerment cultivates a culture of trust [and] energizes initiative.”</em>. I experienced this firsthand. Early on, I was reviewing every piece of code, every marketing blurb. Eventually, I realized I was smothering the very talented people I hired. So I shifted: I set clear expectations and let them figure out  to meet them. I focused on providing support and removing roadblocks rather than doing their jobs. The transformation was immediate – people took , productivity soared, and I was less stressed.</p><p>Leadership is <strong>not about commanding every move</strong> but enabling your team to make the right moves. This is even more true with experienced senior hires – they . Give it to them and they’ll amaze you; stifle them and you’ll lose them.</p><h2>The Challenges of Remote, Cross-Border Teams</h2><p>Our startup is fully remote and globally distributed, which adds another layer of leadership challenge. When your team is spread across cities and time zones, you lose the casual office chatter and nuance of face-to-face interactions. Culture doesn’t form around a ping-pong table or free lunch – you have to  in a remote setting. We discovered that  is key. In a co-located office, a new development might spread via hallway conversations; remotely, nothing spreads unless you communicate it. So we established rituals and systems to keep everyone aligned and connected.</p><p>Some practices that worked for us: daily stand-up check-ins in a chat channel, weekly written summaries of what each team accomplished, virtual “demo days” to show off work, and non-work social calls (yes, even a remote team can have a coffee break together on Zoom). These rituals give shape to our weeks and reinforce our values. <strong>Team rituals can foster a sense of belonging and glue a remote team together.</strong> For example, every Friday we have a casual video call where we share one success, one challenge, and often a fun personal update. It sounds simple, but these little traditions create camaraderie.</p><p>In cross-border teams, you have different cultures – some folks are very direct, others more indirect. Miscommunications happen easily. To counter this, we wrote down guidelines for how we collaborate: for instance,  in messages (since text can seem curt without tone), and <em>“Don’t confuse silence with agreement”</em> (encouraging people to speak up). We encourage : if something is important, put it in writing and ensure everyone sees it (we use shared docs and Slack channels instead of siloed DMs whenever possible). One quote from a remote-work expert stuck with me: <em>“Effective and open communication is absolutely crucial in a remote team. Without it, everything falls apart.”</em>. We took that to heart by making transparency our default. Almost all conversations and decisions happen in the open.</p><h2>Balancing Perfectionism with Speed</h2><p>Confession: I used to be a perfectionist founder. I obsessed over tiny details – pixel-perfect UI spacing, every comma in a blog post, the exact shade of button colors. High standards are valuable, especially when you’re crafting a product, but <strong>perfectionism can become a double-edged sword</strong>. In a startup,  is often more critical than getting everything 100% perfect. If you wait for perfection, you might miss the market or let competitors overtake you. I had to learn to balance my perfectionist tendencies with the necessity of rapid iteration and innovation. So now, instead of polishing every detail endlessly, we aim for “very good” and then launch and learn. We still value quality – our culture is ambitious about excellence, but we’ve embraced a mantra of .</p><p>This was a tough personal growth area for me. Perfectionism often comes from fear – fear of failure or looking foolish. But a culture overly afraid of mistakes is a culture that . I intentionally encourage my team (and myself) to experiment and accept that some things will fail. We even celebrate failures in a way, by conducting blameless post-mortems and sharing lessons learned. It’s about continuous improvement. As long as we maintain high integrity and fix critical bugs fast, a typo or a suboptimal feature is not the end of the world. Far worse is a culture where people are too scared to take initiative or where product iterations grind to a halt because someone upstairs insists on pixel-perfection.</p><h2>Technical Skills vs. Soft Skills in Leadership</h2><p>Another hard lesson: <strong>technical expertise alone doesn’t make a founder a good leader</strong>. Many startup founders are technical geniuses – they know their product and codebase inside out. That was me; I initially felt my job was to be the smartest person in the room. But I learned that being the smartest coder or best product architect doesn’t automatically translate to leading a team. In fact, overly technical founders can fall into the trap of dominating discussions, dismissing others’ ideas, or doing things themselves instead of teaching others. True leadership requires : communication, empathy, listening, and the ability to inspire and develop others.</p><p>There’s plenty of evidence that  and people skills matter more than IQ in leadership roles. A CareerBuilder survey of hiring managers found <strong>71% of employers value emotional intelligence more than pure IQ or technical skill</strong> in employees. Most said they’d even  a technically brilliant candidate if they lacked people skills, and 75% said they’re more likely to promote someone with high EQ over high IQ. Why? Because leadership is fundamentally about people. You manage things, but you . If you can’t relate, motivate, and adapt to your team’s needs, your technical knowledge won’t save you.</p><p>I had to pivot from being a hands-on tech contributor to a . I still use my technical knowledge – but now it’s to ask the right questions in design reviews, to mentor junior engineers, or to set a high-level technical vision. The goal is to empower others with my knowledge, not to use it to win every argument or make every decision. In fact, Google’s famous Project Oxygen study on management found that among the top traits of great managers were being a good coach, empowering the team, expressing interest in team members’ success, etc., while technical skill ranked much lower down the list. The best technical leaders I’ve seen use their expertise to , not to belittle or micromanage. They are quick to admit when someone else knows more in a domain, showing .</p><p>Leadership in a 5-person startup looks very different from leadership in a 50-person or 500-person company. Early on, as a founder, you wear all the hats – you’re involved in every decision from product design to hiring to setting up the office Wi-Fi. But if things go well, you reach a point where that’s not sustainable (and you become a bottleneck if you try). The role of the founder-CEO . I went through this transition: from a do-everything entrepreneur to a more process-oriented leader who works  the business rather than  the business.</p><p>In the earliest stage (1–10 people), I found it effective to be very hands-on. It was about survival and rapid iteration, so having the founder deeply involved everywhere made sense. But once we had team leads and a bit of structure, I had to step back and . I stopped attending every meeting and focused on creating the  for others to succeed. This meant establishing an operating system for the company – things like goal-setting, OKRs, clear org charts and responsibilities, communication cadences, and cultural norms and then letting those systems run with occasional tweaks. In essence, my job shifted to  that builds the product, instead of directly building the product myself.</p><p>This can be a tough shift for founders (it certainly was for me) because it feels like letting go of your “baby.” But letting go, done right, is incredibly empowering for your team and freeing for you. As one Entrepreneur article headline put it: <em>“Letting go of control was the hardest — and smartest — move I ever made.”</em> The author noted that delegating and sharing ownership <strong>built trust, boosted creativity, and empowered the team</strong>. I experienced the same. The more I let talented people take charge of their domains, the more innovation bubbled up without my intervention. Delegation also freed up my time to focus on long-term strategy, fundraising, and big partnerships – the things a CEO  be doing to unlock the next level of growth.</p><p>Finally, a bit of heartfelt advice to fellow and future founders: <strong>build a company culture you’d be proud of even if the venture fails</strong>. Startups are risky – not all succeed in terms of product-market fit or profit. But no matter what happens, the culture you create is a legacy in its own right. If you foster an environment of learning, respect, and passion, that will impact people’s careers and lives positively, far beyond the lifespan of the startup. I’ve had employees tell me that working at our startup – even during rocky times – was the most growthful period of their careers because of the culture we cultivated. That means more to me than any revenue milestone.</p><p>Culture is . It survives pivots, market crashes, and even company failures. Conversely, a toxic culture can destroy a company at its peak. So treat culture as your most precious asset. It’s not a fluffy HR thing; it’s arguably  important than your product strategy. If your only goal as a founder is to flip a quick profit, you might be tempted to cut corners – hire that brilliant jerk, tolerate a bad behavior because someone is “critical,” chase a revenue opportunity that violates your values, and one day you wake up hating the company you’ve created (and likely, your team will too). I strongly believe . One wrong hire or ethical lapse for short-term gain can torpedo everything. Profit is important (you need a sustainable business), but profit will come  of a strong culture that delivers great products and services. It shouldn’t come  of culture.</p><p>So make choices you can be proud of. Define success in cultural terms, not just financial ones. For me, a win is when I see team members solving problems together without me, or when a new hire says, “I’ve never been in a workplace this open and motivating,” or when our alumni go on to spread our cultural values in other companies. Those things indicate we built something  And ironically, a healthy culture tends to lead to better business outcomes anyway – engaged, happy teams build better products and give better customer service. There’s data on this as well: companies with healthy cultures have lower turnover and higher performance. A toxic culture, on the other hand,  companies billions in turnover and disengagement.</p><p>Focus on culture as much as your product. <strong>Culture is what remains when products pivot and strategies change</strong>. It’s in every decision, every conversation, every email, every hire, every celebration of a win, and every post-mortem of a failure. It’s how your company  from the inside, and how that radiates to customers and partners on the outside. As a founder, you are the initial architect of this culture. Invest in it mightily. If you do it right, your startup will not only have a better chance of success but be the kind of company you’re proud to lead, and others are proud to work for, no matter what the outcome.</p><h2>Key Takeaways for First-Time Founders</h2><p>Your behavior sets the cultural tone. Embody the values you preach, especially under pressure. Trust and transparency from leadership foster employee trust and loyalty.</p><h3>Hire for Culture Fit &amp; Character</h3><p>Early hires determine your startup’s destiny. Prioritize cultural alignment and attitude over just skills. One toxic hire can cost more than several great performers add –  compromise on character.</p><p>Share context and news (good and bad) openly with your team. Honest communication builds trust and prevents rumor mills. A culture of openness keeps everyone aligned and accountable.</p><h3>Empower, Don’t Micromanage</h3><p>Founders must learn to let go. Give teams ownership of their work and authority to make decisions. Micromanagement erodes morale and trust, whereas empowerment creates a proactive, engaged culture.</p><h3>Be Intentional in Remote Culture</h3><p>For distributed teams, over-communicate and establish rituals to build cohesion. Use tools and regular check-ins to ensure no one feels isolated. Maintain a strong sense of mission and shared values across borders.</p><h3>Mission and Purpose Matter</h3><p>Rally your team around a clear mission. Mission-driven teams have higher engagement and resilience. Align decisions with your core purpose to avoid short-term thinking.</p><h3>Balance Ambition with Humanity</h3><p>Set ambitious goals, but watch for burnout. Encourage a mindset of learning from failures. Recognize and reward efforts, and don’t punish well-intentioned mistakes. A supportive environment will achieve more in the long run.</p><h3>Value Soft Skills in Leadership</h3><p>Emotional intelligence, communication, and empathy are as crucial as technical savvy (if not more). Great founders grow into  and , not just chief technicians. Invest in your leadership skills like you do in product skills.</p><h3>Evolve and Scale Yourself</h3><p>Continuously adapt your leadership style as the company grows. Implement systems and processes to replace ad-hoc management. Delegate decisions and trust your team – this builds a scalable culture of empowerment.</p><h3>Protect and Nurture Culture</h3><p>Treat culture as your most valuable asset. Don’t sacrifice it for short-term gains. Build a company you admire for its principles and environment, not just its profits. In the end, culture is the legacy that endures in your team’s hearts and careers, whatever the outcome of the startup.</p><p>By keeping these lessons in mind, first-time founders can avoid common pitfalls and create a startup culture that is not only enjoyable and ethical but also a competitive advantage. Build a company that you and your team will be proud of – one where the culture is , resilient, and truly reflective of the best you have to offer as a leader.</p>","contentLength":19837,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Clean Architecture; How To Keep Your Codebase Scalable Without Overengineering","url":"https://hackernoon.com/clean-architecture-how-to-keep-your-codebase-scalable-without-overengineering?source=rss","date":1761892066,"author":"Aleeza Adnan","guid":102772,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Clean Architecture has turned into the “eat more protein” advice of software engineering. Everyone repeats it. Everyone shares the same circle diagram. Almost no one talks about what it’s actually like to  with it.</p><p>When I first tried applying it, I kept asking myself: <em>am I writing better code or just more files?</em></p><p>Most articles treat Clean Architecture like a theory exam, abstract entities, endless layers, and rules that fall apart the moment a real feature ships. But I don’t write code for diagrams. I write code that has to change, stay testable, and not drive me insane as the product grows.</p><p>So instead of another diagram, I want to talk about what Clean Architecture looks like in practice the parts worth keeping, the parts that just slow you down, and how to evolve a version that actually works in real projects.</p><h2>What The Layers Actually Look Like</h2><p>In my current project, a fairly large one, I’ve settled on a structure that’s simple enough to reason about but strong enough to grow. It follows the usual three layers: , , and . What matters most isn’t the names or number of layers, but how they depend on each other and how responsibilities are divided.</p><p>==This setup is tuned for mobile development. If you’re working on a web app, the same ideas apply, but the outer layers will look a little different. Where I have background services, local database managers, and offline sync, a web app might rely on browser storage, API caching, or server-driven state. The principles stay identical clean but the implementation details shift with the platform.==</p><ol><li>The  handles the user-facing side: screens, widgets, and a View Model (VM) for each feature. The VM only talks to the domain layer. That rule alone prevents a lot of accidental coupling and keeps UI code clean.</li><li>The  defines how the app behaves. It contains all , small, focused pieces of logic that represent what the app . It also declares the , which act as boundaries between the domain and data layers. The data layer can’t just do whatever it wants; it has to conform to these promises. If there’s code in the data layer that no one calls, it simply dies off on its own.</li><li>The  provides the actual implementations for those repositories. These call into  that handle background events, local storage, and communication with external systems through the . The background service, in turn, keeps things running smoothly, syncing data, writing to the database, and managing API calls, without the rest of the system needing to know the details.</li></ol><p>All  live in the domain, shared across layers. That keeps data models consistent and avoids the constant mapping that usually clutters large codebases.</p><p>This setup may look heavy at first, but in practice it saves time and stress. Clear boundaries make it easier to change things without worrying about breaking something unrelated. When a new feature comes in, I know exactly where it belongs. If a bug shows up, I can usually trace it to the right layer within minutes.</p><p>Over time, this separation of concerns has proven to be the main reason the codebase stays manageable. It’s not about following a pattern perfectly, it’s about keeping the system loosely coupled enough that it can keep growing without turning fragile.</p><h2>What I Learned the Hard Way</h2><p>Early on, I thought Clean Architecture was about layers and abstractions. It’s not. It’s about staying in control when your codebase starts growing faster than you can refactor. Here are some of the things I learned, some of these may sound like , let me tell you this: IT WAS’NT, at least to me.</p><ol><li><p>A layer is only useful if it protects you from something, framework churn, backend changes, or accidental coupling. If it doesn’t, it’s just ceremony.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstractions should earn their place,</strong> Don’t create a repository interface unless you can imagine a second implementation. Theoretical flexibility is just another word for clutter.</p></li><li><p>Domain should never depend on UI frameworks or database details. Every time I ignored that rule, debugging felt like trying to untie headphones.</p><p>This structure doesn’t make development faster, it makes it . You actually see this pay off when you’re shifting your backend to another platform or maybe redoing your entire UI, THE APP SURVIVES AND SO DO YOU!</p></li></ol>","contentLength":4266,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Understand Any Codebase in 5 Minutes Using an AI Coding Assistant","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-understand-any-codebase-in-5-minutes-using-an-ai-coding-assistant?source=rss","date":1761891919,"author":"James","guid":102771,"unread":true,"content":"<p>You just cloned a repo.

Not chips, not real estate, not even capital. Just boring old electricity.</p><p>The numbers are brutal. A single AI facility can require 96 megawatts, enough to power a small city. And unlike traditional data centers that hum along at steady capacity, AI workloads spike unpredictably. You might go from 30% utilization to 95% in an hour when a new model training run kicks off.</p><p>This creates a nightmare for grid operators. They have to provision for your peak demand, even if you only hit it 10% of the time. And communities are starting to notice. I've watched deals fall apart because local utilities couldn't guarantee the capacity, or city councils rejected permits after residents complained about rate increases.</p><p>So when I saw the announcement this morning about Emerald AI's Manassas facility, I almost scrolled past it. Another hyperscale build, another \"AI-ready\" marketing pitch. But when I dug into the technical architecture, I realized this is different.</p><p>NVIDIA, Emerald AI, EPRI, Digital Realty, and PJM announced the Aurora AI Factory, a 96 MW facility in Manassas, Virginia, slated to open in the first half of 2026. The core idea: what if the data center could negotiate with the grid in real time?</p><p>Emerald's Conductor platform sits between NVIDIA's orchestration layer and PJM's grid signals. When renewable generation drops or demand spikes, it can slow down or pause non-critical model training, reroute inference jobs to less congested data centers, and modulate power draw depending on renewable generation and peak demand, while maintaining acceptable Quality of Service for training and inference.</p><p>In other words, they've built interruptible compute into the architecture. The facility essentially becomes a variable load instead of a fixed drain.</p><p><strong>What Makes This Investable</strong></p><p>Here's what caught my attention from a diligence perspective. The software capabilities that Arushi Sharma Frank (Emerald's senior adviser on power and utilities) detailed in Utility Dive this morning show this isn't vaporware.</p><p>The system can deliver targeted 20-30% power reductions for multi-hour windows during grid peaks, with no snap-back surge afterward. It can sustain curtailments for up to 10 hours. It responds to both rapid (10-minute) and planned (2-hour) dispatch signals. And critically, it can participate in wholesale electricity markets by mapping locational marginal prices into dispatchable bid curves.</p><p>From an investment perspective, this matters because it changes the unit economics. Utilities are more willing to approve facilities that reduce peak load rather than add to it, which means faster interconnection. Variable loads pay less than fixed loads in most tariff structures, which means lower capacity charges. The facility can sell demand response services back to the grid, creating new revenue streams. And perhaps most importantly, this makes data centers politically defensible, creating a regulatory tailwind.</p><p>The proof is in their earlier testing. A demonstration showed Emerald AI can reduce AI workload power consumption by 25% over three hours during a grid stress event, while ensuring acceptable performance. That's measured, not modeled.</p><p><strong>The Market Structure Question</strong></p><p>Now here's where I get skeptical. They claim that if this reference design were adopted nationwide, it could unlock an estimated 100 GW of capacity on the existing electricity system, equivalent to 20% of total U.S. electricity consumption in a year.</p><p>That feels optimistic and assumes perfect coordination across thousands of facilities. But the directional concept is sound. If you can make AI compute interruptible without breaking SLAs, you solve two problems: you reduce infrastructure costs, and you make data centers politically palatable again.</p><p>The real test will be whether customers accept the tradeoff. Training runs that take 36 hours instead of 24 because you're opportunistically using cheaper off-peak power? Some will bite. Others won't. The phrase \"acceptable Quality of Service\" is doing a lot of work here. It means some workloads will run slower or pause when the grid needs relief.</p><p>What I'm watching for: whether this creates a two-tier market. Latency-sensitive inference stays on traditional fixed-capacity infrastructure, while cost-sensitive training migrates to flex-power facilities. If that split happens, the economics of data center real estate start looking very different, and so do the returns.</p><p>The Aurora facility will serve as a live innovation hub, running demonstrations with EPRI's DCFlex Initiative to validate performance during heatwaves, renewable shortfalls, and peak loads. Real-world proof matters more than whitepapers at this point.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line for Infrastructure Investors</strong></p><p>We're past the point where you can just throw more diesel generators at the problem. The grid won't allow it, permitting won't support it, and the math doesn't work. Power flexibility isn't a nice-to-have anymore. It's table stakes for the next wave of deployment.</p><p>For anyone evaluating data center infrastructure plays, the questions to ask are shifting. Can the facility participate in demand response programs? What's the economic model for interruptible versus fixed capacity? How does power flexibility affect interconnection timelines? What percentage of workloads can actually tolerate curtailment?</p><p>The announcement came from Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin this morning, calling it critical for both AI competitiveness and grid affordability. That tells you how serious the political pressure has become around data center power consumption.</p><p>We'll see if the tech scales. But at least someone's solving the right problem.</p>","contentLength":5740,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Build Your First MCP Server using FastMCP","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-your-first-mcp-server-using-fastmcp?source=rss","date":1761891787,"author":"Manish Shivanandhan","guid":102769,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is changing how large language models connect with data and tools.</p><p>Instead of treating an AI model as a black box, MCP gives it structured access to information and actions.</p><p>It is like the USB-C port for AI, creating a standard way for models to interact with servers that hold real-world data or perform useful tasks.</p><p><a href=\"https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome\">FastMCP </a>is the easiest and fastest framework for building MCP servers with Python. It hides all the complex protocol details and lets you focus on your logic.</p><p>In this guide, you will learn what MCP is, how FastMCP works, and how to build and run your first MCP server from scratch.</p><ul><li>Creating Your First MCP Server</li><li>Connecting with an MCP Client</li><li>Authentication and Security</li><li>Deploying Your MCP Server</li><li>Using the MCP Server with an LLM Application</li></ul><p>MCP is a standard protocol that allows language models to talk to external systems in a secure and consistent way. <a href=\"https://www.turingtalks.ai/p/difference-between-mcp-and-api\">MCP is similar to an API</a>, but built for large language models instead of humans.</p><p>An MCP server can do three main things.</p><ul><li>It can expose data as resources (similar to GET endpoints)</li><li>Provide actions through tools (similar to POST requests)</li><li>Define prompts that guide how the model interacts with data or users.</li></ul><p>For example, a resource might return a list of articles, a tool might analyze those articles, and a prompt might define how the model summarizes them. By connecting an LLM to such an MCP server, you give it the power to use your own data and logic in real time.</p><p>While you could build an MCP server using the <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">official SDK</a>, FastMCP takes things much further. It is a production-ready framework with enterprise authentication, client libraries, testing tools, and automatic API generation.</p><p>You can use FastMCP to build secure, scalable MCP applications that integrate with providers like Google, GitHub, and Azure. It also supports deployment to the cloud or your own infrastructure.</p><p>Most importantly, the framework is extremely developer-friendly. You can create a working MCP server in just a few lines of Python code.</p><h2>Creating Your First MCP&nbsp;Server</h2><p>Before you start building, install FastMCP in your Python environment. You can use pip or uv. The uv tool is recommended because it handles environments and dependencies efficiently.</p><p>Once installed, you are ready to write your first server.</p><p>Every MCP server starts with the  class. This class represents your application and manages your tools, resources, and prompts. Let’s start by creating a simple server that adds two numbers together.</p><p>Create a file named  and add the following code:</p><pre><code>from fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Demo Server 🚀\")\n\n@mcp.tool\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers and return the result\"\"\"\n    return a + b\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    mcp.run()\n</code></pre><p>That is all you need. You have just created a fully working MCP server with one tool called . When a client calls this tool, the server adds two numbers and returns the result.</p><p>To run your server locally, open your terminal and type:</p><p>This command starts the MCP server. You can also use <a href=\"https://www.pubnub.com/guides/server-sent-events/\">HTTP or SSE </a>transports for web-based deployments. For example, to run your server over HTTP, use:</p><pre><code>mcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000, path=\"/mcp\")\n</code></pre><p>Once the server is running, clients can connect and call the  tool remotely.</p><p>FastMCP tools are simple Python functions that you decorate with . You can add as many as you like. Let’s add a multiplication tool next:</p><pre><code>@mcp.tool\ndef multiply(a: float, b: float) -&gt; float:\n    \"\"\"Multiply two numbers\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n</code></pre><p>You can now run the server again, and clients will have access to both the  and  tools.</p><p>FastMCP automatically generates schemas based on your function signatures and docstrings, making it easy for clients to understand your API.</p><p>Resources in MCP represent read-only data that clients can access. You can create static resources or dynamic templates that take parameters. For example, you might expose a version number or a user profile.</p><pre><code>@mcp.resource(\"config://version\")\ndef get_version():\n    return \"1.0.0\"\n\n@mcp.resource(\"user://{user_id}/profile\")\ndef get_profile(user_id: int):\n    return {\"name\": f\"User {user_id}\", \"status\": \"active\"}\n</code></pre><p>In this example, the first resource always returns the version number, while the second resource dynamically fetches a user profile based on the ID provided.</p><p>FastMCP allows you to access the session context within any tool, resource, or prompt by including a  parameter. The context gives you powerful capabilities like logging, <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/sampling\">LLM sampling</a>, progress tracking, and resource access.</p><p>Here is an example that shows how to use context:</p><pre><code>from fastmcp import Context\n\n@mcp.tool\nasync def summarize(uri: str, ctx: Context):\n    await ctx.info(f\"Reading resource from {uri}\")\n    data = await ctx.read_resource(uri)\n    summary = await ctx.sample(f\"Summarize this: {data.content[:500]}\")\n    return summary.text\n</code></pre><p>This tool logs a message, reads a resource, and then asks the client’s language model to summarise it. Context makes your MCP tools smarter and more interactive.</p><h2>Connecting with an MCP&nbsp;Client</h2><p>Once your server is running, you can connect to it using the  class. The client can communicate via STDIO, HTTP, or SSE, and can even run in-memory for testing.</p><p>Here is a simple example of connecting to your local server and calling the  tool:</p><pre><code>from fastmcp import Client\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def main():\n    async with Client(\"server.py\") as client:\n        tools = await client.list_tools()\n        print(\"Available tools:\", tools)\n        result = await client.call_tool(\"add\", {\"a\": 5, \"b\": 7})\n        print(\"Result:\", result.content[0].text)\nasyncio.run(main())\n</code></pre><p>You can also connect to multiple servers using a standard MCP configuration file, making it easy to build complex systems that interact with several services simultaneously.</p><h2>Authentication and&nbsp;Security</h2><p>When you move from development to production, authentication becomes important.</p><p>FastMCP has built-in support for enterprise-grade authentication providers such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, Auth0, and WorkOS. You can enable secure OAuth-based access with just a few lines of code.</p><pre><code>from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider\nfrom fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nauth = GoogleProvider(client_id=\"...\", client_secret=\"...\", base_url=\"https://myserver.com\")\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Secure Server\", auth=auth)\n</code></pre><p>Now only authenticated users can access your server. On the client side, you can connect using an OAuth flow like this:</p><pre><code>async with Client(\"https://secure-server.com/mcp\", auth=\"oauth\") as client:\n    result = await client.call_tool(\"protected_tool\")\n</code></pre><p>FastMCP handles tokens, refreshes, and error handling automatically.</p><h2>Deploying Your MCP&nbsp;Server</h2><p>You can deploy FastMCP servers anywhere.</p><p>For testing, the  command is enough. For production, you can deploy to <a href=\"https://fastmcp.cloud/\">FastMCP Cloud</a>, which provides instant HTTPS endpoints and built-in authentication.</p><p>If you prefer to self-host, use the HTTP or SSE transport to serve your MCP endpoints from your own infrastructure. A simple deployment command might look like this:</p><pre><code>mcp.run(transport=\"http\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8080)\n</code></pre><p>Once deployed, your MCP server is ready to connect with language models, web clients, or automation workflows.</p><h2>Using the MCP Server with an LLM Application</h2><p>Once your MCP server is running, the next step is to connect it to a large language model. This allows an LLM to securely call your server’s functions, read resources, and perform actions as part of a conversation.</p><p>To connect an LLM application, you first define your MCP configuration file. This file lists the available servers, their connection methods, and any authentication requirements.</p><p>Once configured, the LLM can automatically discover your MCP tools and call them when needed.</p><p>For example, if your server exposes an  or  tool, the model can directly use them as if they were built-in capabilities. In a chat-based environment, when a user asks the model to perform a task such as “Summarize the latest article,” the LLM will call your  tool, process the result, and respond with the output.</p><p>If you are building a custom LLM application with frameworks like OpenAI’s Assistants API or LangChain, you can register your MCP server as an external tool. The LLM then interacts with it through the MCP client library.</p><p>Here is a simple example:</p><pre><code>from fastmcp import Client\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def main():\n    # Connect to your MCP server\n    async with Client(\"http://localhost:8000/mcp\") as client:\n        # Call an MCP tool directly\n        result = await client.call_tool(\"add\", {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 5})\n        print(\"MCP Result:\", result.content[0].text)\n        # Use the result inside an LLM prompt\n        llm = OpenAI(api_key=\"YOUR_KEY\")\n        response = llm.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"gpt-4\",\n            messages=[\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an AI assistant using MCP tools.\"},\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"The sum of 10 and 5 is {result.content[0].text}. Explain how MCP helps with this integration.\"}\n            ]\n        )\n        print(response.choices[0].message.content)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n</code></pre><p>In this setup, the LLM can seamlessly combine its reasoning with your server’s logic. It uses the MCP client to fetch data or perform computations and then incorporates the output into its conversation or workflow.</p><p>This approach lets you build intelligent systems that go beyond static prompts. You can connect your LLM to real databases, APIs, or automation tools, turning it into an active agent that can read, write, and execute with real-world context.</p><p>FastMCP makes it simple to bring your data, APIs, and tools into the world of AI through the Model Context Protocol.

Coffee ready, music on, Claude Code open. I was building a feature and feeling productive until I hit the API selection.</p><p>The AI confidently chose an API. I implemented it. Tests failed. I asked the AI to fix it. It chose the same API again. Different approach, same deprecated API. After the fifth iteration, I realized: <strong>the AI was stuck in a loop, and it was absolutely convinced this deprecated API was the right choice.</strong></p><p>\"But this API is deprecated,\" I'd say.</p><p>\"You're right, let me use the current one,\" it would respond.</p><p>Next prompt? Back to the deprecated API. With complete confidence.</p><p>That moment crystallized a problem I'd been dancing around for months: <strong>vibe coding is powerful, but it's also frustrating as hell.</strong> And I'm not alone in this realization.</p><p>The AI development community is having a reckoning. We've moved past the honeymoon phase of \"wow, AI can code!\" and into the uncomfortable reality of production deployments. The criticisms are everywhere:</p><ul><li>\"AI coding tools create security holes\"</li><li>\"The context window breaks on real projects\"</li><li>\"My AI gets stuck in infinite loops\"</li><li>\"This code isn't production ready\"</li><li>\"It's just glorified autocomplete - another hype bubble\"</li></ul><p>As an Engineering Manager with 18 years of experience and founder of DS APPS Inc, I've seen both sides. I've used AI to ship Android apps and open-source projects faster than ever before. But I've also seen the chaos that emerges when you let AI run wild without structure.</p><p>So I spent the past 8-12 months mastering prompt engineering, learning from failures, and documenting what actually works. The result is  - a framework that turns any AI coding assistant into a disciplined software development team.</p><p>And here's the radical part: <strong>it's not software. It's pure prompt engineering.</strong></p><h2>The Three Struggles That Led to DevFlow</h2><p>My journey with AI coding tools started like most developers: excitement mixed with frustration. As I pushed beyond simple scripts into real projects, three critical problems emerged:</p><h3>1. The Prompt Paralysis Problem</h3><p>In the beginning, every interaction with the AI was a negotiation. <em>How do I phrase this? What context do I include? Should I be specific or let the AI decide?</em> I was spending more time crafting prompts than I would have spent just writing the code myself.</p><p>The AI would make architectural decisions without asking me. It would choose library versions arbitrarily. It would implement features in ways that didn't align with my project's patterns. I felt like I was managing a developer who wouldn't ask questions.</p><h3>2. The Context Catastrophe</h3><p>As projects grew beyond a few hundred lines, the context window became my enemy. The AI would forget critical constraints from earlier in the conversation. It would contradict its own earlier decisions. It would recreate functionality that already existed.</p><p>I needed sub-agents - separate contexts for separate concerns - but managing that manually was exhausting.</p><p>I wanted the AI to work while I slept. I wanted to delegate entire features and wake up to completed, tested code. But every attempt at autonomous AI coding ended in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>The AI asked me a question and sat idle for 8 hours</li><li>The AI made assumptions and built the wrong thing</li></ul><p>What I needed was a system that could operate autonomously <strong>but tracked every decision it made</strong>, creating an audit trail I could review and question later.</p><h2>The Insight: AI Doesn't Need Better Models, It Needs Better Process</h2><p>After months of iteration, I had a realization: <strong>the problem wasn't the AI's capabilities - it was the lack of engineering discipline.</strong></p><p>Traditional software development has structure for a reason:</p><ul><li>Product managers define requirements</li><li>Architects make technical decisions</li><li>Developers implement code</li><li>Security reviews for vulnerabilities</li></ul><p>Why were we throwing all of that away just because AI was doing the typing?</p><p>That's when DevFlow clicked into place. What if I could encode software engineering methodology into a prompt engineering framework? What if the AI could role-play different team members, each with their own responsibilities and quality gates?</p><h2>DevFlow: Where AI Meets Engineering Discipline</h2><p>DevFlow is a config-driven framework that orchestrates AI coding assistants through structured prompts. It's not a new tool you need to install - it works with <strong>Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or any AI assistant.</strong></p><h3>1. Clone DevFlow Into Your Project</h3><pre><code>cd YourProject\ngit clone https://github.com/dondetir/DevFlow.git DevFlow\necho \"DevFlow/\" &gt;&gt; .gitignore\n</code></pre><pre><code># DevFlow Orchestration\nRead and follow: ./DevFlow/ORCHESTRATOR.md\n</code></pre><p>For Cursor (.cursorrules), Gemini CLI (<a href=\"http://gemini.md\">gemini.md</a>), or other tools - same line, different config file.</p><ul><li>Auto-initialize the  structure</li><li>Guide you through the right workflow</li></ul><h2>The Architecture: 9 Agents, 5 Workflows, Pure Prompts</h2><p>DevFlow introduces , each with distinct behaviors defined in YAML files:</p><ol><li> - Routes tasks to the right workflow</li><li> - Writes user stories and requirements</li><li> - Designs technical solutions and presents options</li><li> - Implements server-side code</li><li> - Builds user interfaces</li><li> - Handles AI/ML components</li><li> - Manages deployment and infrastructure</li><li> - Writes and runs tests</li><li> - Reviews code for vulnerabilities</li></ol><p>The same AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or any other model) role-plays each agent by reading their YAML-defined behaviors. This isn't specific to one AI provider DevFlow works across any coding agent that can read config files. It's prompt engineering at scale.</p><p>DevFlow automatically routes your request to the appropriate workflow:</p><p> (2 gates, 30-120 min)</p><ul><li>Rapid production issue resolution</li><li>Compressed decision-making</li><li>Emergency approval process</li></ul><p> (2 gates, 45-90 min)</p><ul><li>Fast analysis and targeted fix</li><li>Root cause identification</li></ul><p> (3 gates, 2h-3 days)</p><ul><li>Code quality improvement without behavior changes</li><li>Incremental refactoring with continuous testing</li></ul><p> (3 gates, 1-5 days)</p><ul><li>Balanced design and implementation</li><li>Component-level development</li></ul><p> (4 gates + execution, weeks-months)</p><ul><li>Full architecture and planning</li><li>Sprint-based autonomous execution</li></ul><h2>The Two-Prompt Magic: From Idea to Autonomous Execution</h2><p>The genius of DevFlow is its simplicity. You give it , and then it can run autonomously:</p><p><strong>Prompt 1: \"Here's what I want to build…\"</strong> The AI creates a Product Strategy Assessment (PSA), breaks it into epics and user stories, and documents the business requirements.</p><p><strong>Prompt 2: \"I choose Architecture Option B\"</strong> The AI has presented you with 2-3 architectural approaches. You pick one. Now it has everything it needs to execute.</p><p>After those two decisions, the AI can work autonomously while you sleep, with every decision documented in  status files.</p><h2>Real-World Proof: Building Simple MCP in One Session</h2><p>To test DevFlow, I built <a href=\"https://github.com/dondetir/simpleMCP\">Simple MCP</a> - an educational Model Context Protocol server designed to teach developers how MCP works.</p><p>MCP is hot right now (GitHub just launched their MCP Registry in September 2025), and building a server from scratch typically requires:</p><ul><li>Understanding the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol</li><li>Implementing STDIO transport</li><li>Defining tools, resources, and prompts</li><li>Writing comprehensive documentation</li><li>Testing with multiple MCP clients</li></ul><ol><li>I cloned DevFlow into the project</li><li>I gave it one prompt: \"Build an educational MCP server that demonstrates basic MCP concepts\"</li><li>The Architect agent presented 3 implementation approaches</li><li>I chose Option B (balanced complexity)</li><li>DevFlow executed autonomously</li></ol><p>The result? A working MCP server with:</p><ul><li>README with setup instructions</li><li>Security review completed</li></ul><p>No back-and-forth prompting. No context loss. No security holes. Just a production-ready educational tool.</p><h2>How DevFlow Solves the \"Vibe Coding\" Criticisms</h2><p>Let me address each criticism directly:</p><h3>\"AI Coding Creates Security Issues\"</h3><p> The Security Expert agent reviews every piece of code with a security-focused lens. It checks for common vulnerabilities (injection attacks, authentication bypasses, data exposure) and provides recommendations. Everything is documented in the audit trail.</p><p>You still need to review it - DevFlow handles about 80% of the security analysis - but you have a structured security assessment rather than hoping you caught everything manually.</p><h3>\"Context Loss Breaks Real Projects\"</h3><p> Sub-agents with separate contexts. Each agent (Backend Dev, Frontend Dev, etc.) maintains its own context window. The  status files persist state across sessions, so context is never lost between conversations.</p><p>When you return after 8 hours, DevFlow reads the status files and knows exactly where it left off.</p><h3>\"AI Gets Stuck in Infinite Loops\"</h3><p> Quality gates ensure understanding before implementation. The AI can't start coding until it's completed the analysis phase. It can't mark a story complete until different agents have reviewed and tested it.</p><p>The workflow structure prevents the \"regenerate the same buggy code 10 times\" problem because gates force the AI to move through distinct phases.</p><h3>\"AI Code Isn't Production Ready\"</h3><p> Three-agent quality process:</p><ol><li>A Dev agent writes the code</li><li>A different Dev agent reviews it (peer review simulation)</li><li>QA agent tests it and verifies acceptance criteria</li></ol><p>This catches about 80% of production readiness issues. The human still needs to do final review, but DevFlow handles the bulk of quality assurance.</p><h3>\"It's Just Hype - AI Can't Really Code\"</h3><p> I take the middle stance. AI coding is a tool - used wisely, it's transformative. Used carelessly, it's destructive.</p><p>DevFlow encodes the \"wisely\" part. It's not about making AI smarter; it's about making AI more disciplined.</p><h2>The 80% Rule: What DevFlow Automates (And What It Doesn't)</h2><p>Let me be clear about what DevFlow does and doesn't do:</p><p><strong>DevFlow Automates (≈80%):</strong></p><ul><li>Requirement analysis and story creation</li><li>Architecture option generation</li><li>Test case generation and execution</li><li>Security vulnerability scanning</li></ul><p><strong>Humans Must Still (≈20%):</strong></p><ul><li>Make strategic architecture decisions</li><li>Verify acceptance criteria</li><li>Make final production approval</li><li>Handle edge cases the AI missed</li><li>Understand the business context</li></ul><p>DevFlow isn't trying to replace developers. It's trying to give developers a <strong>disciplined AI development team</strong> that does the grunt work while preserving human judgment for critical decisions.</p><h2>Why This Matters: Democratizing AI Development</h2><p>The promise of AI coding tools was supposed to be democratization - anyone could build software. But the reality has been gatekeeping by expertise: <strong>only people who master prompt engineering can use AI tools effectively.</strong></p><p>DevFlow flips this. You don't need to be a prompt engineering expert. You don't need to know how to structure agent conversations or manage context windows or prevent infinite loops.</p><p>DevFlow encodes that expertise for you.</p><p> learning software engineering - DevFlow teaches them process while they build</p><p> building MVPs - DevFlow gives them a full dev team without hiring costs</p><p><strong>Companies Afraid of AI Risk</strong> - DevFlow provides the audit trail and quality gates they need</p><p> wanting to ship faster - DevFlow handles the boilerplate so they focus on hard problems</p><h2>The Technical Deep Dive: How It Actually Works</h2><p>For the engineers reading this who want to understand the mechanics:</p><p>DevFlow is a collection of:</p><ul><li> defining agent behaviors, workflow rules, and quality gates</li><li> for documents (PSA, stories, architecture proposals)</li><li> (JSON) tracking progress across sessions</li><li> () that the AI reads</li></ul><p>When you start your AI tool, it reads  which references all the other configs. The AI essentially \"compiles\" the framework by reading these prompts.</p><p>No code execution. No dependencies. No binary. Just the AI following structured instructions.</p><p>The workflows are defined as state machines:</p><pre><code>workflow: bug_fix\nphases:\n  - name: analysis\n    agents: [architect]\n    gates: [root_cause_identified]\n  - name: implementation  \n    agents: [backend_dev, frontend_dev]\n    gates: [code_reviewed, tests_passing]\n</code></pre><p>The AI reads this, understands the flow, and orchestrates itself through the phases.</p><p>It's prompt engineering as infrastructure.</p><h2>Getting Started: Your First DevFlow Project</h2><p>Ready to try it? Here's how to start:</p><p>Start with something small - a feature, a bug fix, or a simple utility. Don't start with your production codebase.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dondetir/DevFlow.git DevFlow\n</code></pre><p>Add the orchestrator line to your AI tool's config (<a href=\"http://claude.md\">claude.md</a>, .cursorrules, etc.)</p><p>Launch Claude Code, Cursor, or your preferred tool. DevFlow will initialize automatically.</p><ul><li>Which architecture approach?</li></ul><p>DevFlow will execute autonomously. Check the  folder to see progress.</p><p>When DevFlow completes a phase, review the documents it created. Approve or request changes.</p><p>DevFlow is MIT licensed and actively evolving. Here's what I'm thinking about:</p><p> - Imagine a community repository of workflows:</p><ul><li>Mobile app development workflow</li><li>Data science pipeline workflow</li><li>Infrastructure as code workflow</li></ul><p> - Track DevFlow's effectiveness:</p><ul><li>Time saved vs. traditional development</li><li>Defect rates for DevFlow projects</li><li>Quality gate pass/fail rates</li></ul><p><strong>Integration with Project Management</strong> - Export DevFlow status to Jira, Linear, GitHub Projects</p><p> - Let different agents use different models (GPT for architecture, Claude for coding, etc.)</p><p>But I need your help to build this.</p><p>If you're a CTO, engineering manager, or founder concerned about AI development risks, DevFlow addresses your core worries:</p><p>✅  - Every decision documented</p><p>✅  - No incomplete work marked as done</p><p>✅  - Automated vulnerability scanning</p><p>✅  - Different agents review each other's code</p><p>✅  - State persists across sessions</p><p>You get the velocity of AI development with the safety of traditional software engineering.</p><h2>The Honest Take: DevFlow Isn't Perfect</h2><p>Let me be transparent about limitations:</p><ul><li>DevFlow requires an AI tool that supports reading config files (Claude Code, Cursor, etc. work; basic ChatGPT doesn't)</li><li>The initial setup requires understanding your AI tool's config system</li><li>DevFlow is still evolving - you'll encounter rough edges</li><li>It works best with projects that fit standard workflows (custom workflows need more work)</li><li>The AI can still make mistakes - the 80% rule is real</li></ul><p>But even with these limitations, DevFlow has fundamentally changed how I build software. I ship faster, with fewer bugs, and with complete documentation of every decision made.</p><h2>Your Turn: Share Your Experience</h2><p>I'm releasing DevFlow as open source because I believe structured AI development is too important to be proprietary. I want to see what you build with it.</p><p><strong>Try DevFlow on your next project:</strong></p><ul><li>What workflows did you use?</li><li>What would make DevFlow better?</li></ul><ul></ul><p><strong>Questions? Open an issue on GitHub or reach out. I'm actively developing DevFlow and want to hear what real developers need.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>The AI revolution in software development is happening. But it doesn't have to be chaotic. We can have both the velocity of AI and the discipline of engineering.</strong></p><p><strong>DevFlow is my answer to making AI coding safe, auditable, and production-ready. It's not about replacing developers with AI - it's about giving developers AI teammates that follow the same rigorous processes we expect from human engineers.</strong></p><p><strong>The code we write with AI should be as trustworthy as the code we write ourselves. DevFlow is how we get there.</strong></p><p><strong>Now it's your turn. Clone the repo. Build something. Break something. Learn something. And share what you discover.</strong></p><p><strong>Because the best way to solve the vibe coding problem isn't to stop using AI - it's to give AI better guardrails.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>About the Author: I'm an Engineering Manager with 18 years of experience and founder of DS APPS Inc, a nonprofit publishing free Android apps and open-source AI applications.

With this, users aren't able to conduct comprehensive research on their topic of interest, and manually copy pasting is not a good user experience.</p><pre><code>===============================================================================\n               LINEAR CHAT STRUCTURE LIMITATION\n===============================================================================\n\n    Current LLM Interface Design\n            |\n    +-------+-------+\n    |               |\n    Question 1      Answer 1\n    |               |\n    Question 2      Answer 2\n    |               |\n    Question 3      Answer 3\n    |               |\n    Question 4      Answer 4\n\n    PROBLEM: One-dimensional flow only\n             No branching or comparison\n             No parallel model testing\n             Sequential only structure\n\n    +---------------------------+\n    | Cannot compare models     |\n    | side-by-side within app   |\n    +---------------------------+\n</code></pre><pre><code>===============================================================================\n          INFORMATION LOSS SCENARIOS\n===============================================================================\n\n    Scenario A: Forgot to Copy\n    ---------------------------\n    User asks GPT-5  --&gt;  Gets Answer A  --&gt;  Forgets to copy\n            |\n    Toggles to Claude  --&gt;  Gets Answer B  --&gt;  Copies it\n            |\n    Result: Answer A is LOST FOREVER\n\n\n    Scenario B: Accidental Closure\n    -------------------------------\n    User asks Gemini  --&gt;  Gets Answer C  --&gt;  Before copying\n            |\n    Browser crashes / App closes / Navigates away\n            |\n    Result: Answer C is LOST FOREVER\n\n\n    Scenario C: Overwrite Mistake\n    ------------------------------\n    User copies Answer 1  --&gt;  Copies Answer 2  --&gt;  Forgets first\n            |\n    Clipboard overwrites previous content\n            |\n    Result: Answer 1 is LOST\n\n\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\n    | No Version Control = Permanent Loss           |\n    +-----------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre><pre><code>===============================================================================\n          POOR USER EXPERIENCE ELEMENTS\n===============================================================================\n\n    UX Problem Category          Specific Issues\n    -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    FRICTION\n    --------\n    + Multiple app switches      [High cognitive load]\n    + Context switching          [Mental overhead]\n    + Repetitive typing          [Wasted effort]\n    + Manual copy-paste          [Error-prone]\n\n    INEFFICIENCY\n    ------------\n    + No batch comparison        [One-by-one only]\n    + Rebuild same prompt        [Redundant work]\n    + External doc needed        [Extra tool required]\n    + No saved history           [Can't revisit easily]\n\n    FRAGILITY\n    ---------\n    + Easy to lose answers       [No safety net]\n    + No version control         [Can't undo]\n    + Clipboard overwrites       [Single buffer limit]\n    + No recovery option         [Permanent loss]\n\n    LIMITATIONS\n    -----------\n    + Linear structure only      [No branching]\n    + Single model at a time     [No parallelism]\n    + No native comparison       [External tools needed]\n    + Poor research workflow     [Not optimized]\n\n    Overall Rating: POOR USER EXPERIENCE\n</code></pre><p>Having a visual mind map of the interactions with timestamps, just like NotebookLM does, would solve a lot of these problems.

This git-inspired architecture can be saved locally on a device, just like how we used to save game progress from PC games in a folder. It would save a snapshot of every output in the background, and users can access that view whenever they need to. This will help them in their study and even learn new things along the way. They'll know if they need to fine-tune their prompt or not depending on the output they are trying to achieve.</p><pre><code>===============================================================================\n            GIT-LIKE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\n===============================================================================\n\n                    LLM Chat Application\n                            |\n        +-------------------+-------------------+\n        |                                       |\n    Working Area                        Local Repository\n    (Active Chat)                       (Snapshot Storage)\n        |                                       |\n    +---v---+                           +-------v-------+\n    | User  |                           | Commit 1      |\n    | Types |                           | Timestamp     |\n    | Quest.|                           | Question      |\n    +---+---+                           | Answer        |\n        |                               +-------+-------+\n    +---v---+                           | Commit 2      |\n    | LLM   |                           | Timestamp     |\n    | Gener.|    Auto-save              | Question      |\n    | Answ. |    ---------&gt;             | Answer        |\n    +---+---+                           +-------+-------+\n        |                               | Commit 3      |\n    +---v---+                           | Timestamp     |\n    | Next  |                           | Question      |\n    | Quest.|                           | Answer        |\n    +-------+                           +-------+-------+\n                                        | ...           |\n                                        | Commit N      |\n                                        +---------------+\n\n    Every interaction automatically saved as a commit\n    Can view/revert to any previous state at any time\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAlso, based on what the user is trying to do, the LLM can suggest a more optimized prompt that can get users to their end goal sooner. This way, the user will spend less time on the app since they'll get their desired output faster, thus burning fewer tokens, which also costs less for the LLM chat company.

This makes it easy to compare different models side by side and keep everything organized for research purposes.</p><pre><code>===============================================================================\n        QUESTION/ANSWER COMPARISON TABLE\n===============================================================================\n\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+\n    |                  Research Chat Export PDF           |\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+\n    |                                                     |\n    | Question 1:                                         |\n    |   Model 1: Answer 1 (timestamp)                     |\n    |   Model 2: Answer 2 (timestamp)                     |\n    |   Model 3: Answer 3 (timestamp)                     |\n    |                                                     |\n    | Question 2:                                         |\n    |   Model 2: Answer 4 (timestamp)                     |\n    |   Model 4: Answer 5 (timestamp)                     |\n    |                                                     |\n    | Question 1.1:                                       |\n    |   Model 1: Edited Answer 6 (timestamp)              |\n    |   Model 5: Edited Answer 7 (timestamp)              |\n    |                                                     |\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+\n    | Organized for easy comparison &amp; navigation          |\n    +-----------------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre><pre><code>===============================================================================\n                  LLM RESEARCH WORKFLOW SUMMARY\n===============================================================================\n\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n   |                          INTRODUCTION                         |\n   | LLMs aid research, studying, and learning; multiple models    |\n   | (Gemini, Grok, GPT5, Claude) accessible in one platform.      |\n   | Models have unique strengths (Grok: real-time info, Claude:   |\n   | safe responses).                                              |\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n                                     |\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n   |                             PROBLEM                           |\n   | Most apps are linear: answers are hard to compare, require    |\n   | manual copy-paste, risk of losing unique outputs, poor UX for |\n   | comprehensive research.                                       |\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n                                     |\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n   |                             SOLUTION                          |\n   | - Visual mind map (like NotebookLM): see all threads, non-    |\n   |   linear, time-stamped flow.                                  |\n   | - Local git-like architecture: auto-snapshot all outputs,     |\n   |   version control for easy access and learning.               |\n   | - Optimized prompt suggestions: faster, better results, fewer |\n   |   tokens—saves time and cost (win-win).                       |\n   | - PDF export: organized Q&amp;A by model, versioning, easy        |\n   |   side-by-side comparison for research.                       |\n   +---------------------------------------------------------------+\n===============================================================================\n</code></pre><p>Thank you for reading my article.</p><p>You can read my article on </p><p>If you want me to write on any other topic, please let me know in the comments.</p><p><em>If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an&nbsp;.

I've been there dozens of times.</p><p>The problem isn't lack of ideas—it's the gap between concept and execution. Most AI prompts for podcast scripting give you generic, robotic-sounding content that feels like it was written by someone who's never actually recorded a podcast.</p><p>So I spent months building something different. A comprehensive prompt system that transforms any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, or Qwen) into a professional podcast scriptwriter who understands audio-first content, listener psychology, and what makes people actually stay engaged.</p><h2>Why Most Podcast Scripts Fail</h2><p>Let's be honest about what goes wrong:</p><p>: \"Welcome to another episode where we discuss interesting topics…\" (Nobody cares)</p><p>: Writing like a blog post instead of something people will hear without visual context</p><p>: Either too dense or too sparse, missing the rhythm that keeps attention</p><p>: Starting with \"Today we're going to talk about…\" instead of something that grabs attention immediately</p><p>: Missing the moments that make people lean in, nod, or reach for their phone to share</p><p>The issue? Most prompts treat podcast scripting like writing an article. But podcasts are different—they're intimate, conversational, and consumed while people are doing other things (driving, working, exercising).</p><h2>The Solution: Audio-First Script Engineering</h2><p>I built a prompt that understands podcasting isn't about information transfer—it's about connection and engagement. The system includes:</p><h3>1. Professional Role Definition</h3><p>Instead of \"helpful assistant,\" the AI becomes a \"professional podcast scriptwriter with 10+ years of experience in audio content creation.\" Specific expertise matters.</p><h3>2. Audio-First Content Structure</h3><p>The prompt enforces podcast-specific sections:</p><ul><li> (0:30-1:00): Hook that captures attention immediately</li><li> (1:00-2:00): Branding and value proposition</li><li> (70-80% of runtime): Segments with natural transitions</li><li> (2-3 minutes): Recap and clear call-to-action</li><li> (0:30): Music and credits</li></ul><h3>3. Technical Production Cues</h3><p>Because podcasts are audio, the prompt includes:</p><ul><li>Music cues: </li><li>Sound effects: </li><li>Pacing markers:  and </li><li>Timestamp estimates: </li><li>Production notes: <code>(NOTE: Direction for host)</code></li></ul><h3>4. Conversational Writing Standards</h3><p>The prompt enforces natural language:</p><ul><li>Contractions and casual speech patterns</li><li>Mix of sentence lengths for rhythm</li><li>Direct audience address (\"you\" instead of \"listeners\")</li><li>Energy variation markers for different segments</li></ul><p>Different podcast types need different approaches:</p><ul><li>: Personal stories and direct advice</li><li>: Flexible structure with guest expertise highlights</li><li>: Storytelling techniques and suspense building</li><li>: Banter and chemistry between hosts</li></ul><h2>Real Results: Before and After</h2><p>Typical AI output for podcast scripting:</p><pre><code>Welcome to episode 47.

This one alone could get you to that $500 goal.\n\n**The Subscription Audit.**\n\n(NOTE: Slow down, emphasize)\n\nHere's what I want you to do—right now, pull out your phone. I'm serious! Pause this if you need to, because this exercise takes about 10 minutes and could save you hundreds.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nOpen your banking app or credit card statement and scroll through the last two months.

You're competing with hundreds of other programs for attention from affiliates who are already making good money promoting your competitors.</p><p>Here's what actually works: finding people who are already successfully creating content about products like yours, and reaching out to them directly. It's not rocket science, but it's incredibly time-consuming if you're doing it manually.&nbsp;</p><p> because it shows you who is promoting your competitors on their website or social media.</p><p>It’s not limited to one particular network or database, and it runs weekly scans to pick up on the freshest opportunities to promote your product or brand.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-dt03cal.png\" alt=\"\">But the right tool for you will depend on your budget, your ICP, and the stage you’re at with your affiliate program. In this guide, I'll break down the 9 best options, explain exactly what makes each one valuable, and help you figure out which tool (or combination of tools) will actually grow your program without wasting your time or budget.</p><p>|  |  |  |  |\n|----|----|----|----|\n|  | Custom, AI-powered affiliate discovery | AI web scraping + weekly scans | $99/month with 7-day free trial |\n|  | Running a SaaS affiliate program | Built-in affiliate discovery | Free until $1K revenue (then $39/month) |\n|  | Traditional publishers | Network integration | $456/month |\n|  | Marketplace access | 3M+ affiliate network | $39/month + fees |\n|  | Influencer recruitment | 100M+ creator database | $299/month |\n|  | Multi-channel campaigns | E-commerce integration | Custom (est. $500+/month) |\n|  | Enterprise influencer programs | AI automation (Gia) | Custom (est. $1,000+/month) |\n|  | Influencer discovery across 30+ platforms | 40+ filter options | $199/month |\n|  | Partnership intelligence | Free B2B directory | Free |</p><p> is the best affiliate discovery tool for SaaS and e-commerce brands because it finds potential partners who are already talking about products just like yours.</p><p>Whereas many other tools rely solely on their own directory or marketplace, AffiliateFinder.ai scans the whole internet to find the best-match affiliates for your brand.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-ci13c3g.png\" alt=\"\"> \\n I tested this with a client in the keyword research tool space. Within 15 minutes of setting it up, AffiliateFinder.ai found 1300+ potential affiliates - bloggers ranking for \"Ahrefs alternatives,\" YouTubers reviewing competitor products, and websites comparing tools in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, these weren't just names in a database from 2019. These were people who had published content in the last few weeks, so I got a much higher response rate than I had with other tools, and recruited more new partners.</p><p>The platform works by continuously scanning the web, YouTube, and Instagram for anyone mentioning your competitors or ranking for your target keywords. It uses AI to filter out irrelevant results (like Wikipedia pages or your actual competitors) and delivers a curated list of partnership opportunities.</p><p>You can view all the stats you need to help make a decision (subscribers, views, engagement rate) without having to leave your dashboard.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-hd23cpn.png\" alt=\"\">This list gets updated every week, with an email notifying you of the top results, so now I have over 3,000 opportunities for this client.</p><p>AffiliateFinder.ai’s filters make it easy to sort through your results and prioritize outreach according to your campaign goals.</p><p>For example, if you want to work with nano-influencers with small but engaged audiences, you can filter results to show those with less than 10k subscribers.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-q433cqe.png\" alt=\"\">As you go through the results, you can add them to different lists according to how relevant they are.&nbsp;</p><p>From your ‘saved’ list, you can check contact details - this finds email addresses and social media profiles associated with the domain or channel.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-qy43cst.png\" alt=\"\">The YouTube email finder deserves special mention because it solves one of the most annoying problems in affiliate recruitment. Normally, getting a YouTuber's email means breaking CAPTCHAs manually, which YouTube actively limits.</p><p>It even finds Linkedin and Twitter (X) profiles for some affiliates, so you can DM them directly if they’re more active on social media than email.&nbsp;</p><p>AffiliateFinder.ai finds these emails in seconds, turning what would be hours of tedious work into a single click. I've personally used this to reach out to 83 YouTube creators in a single afternoon - something that would have taken me several days (and multiple YouTube accounts) to do manually.</p><p>The platform supports 195+ countries and 40+ languages, which matters more than you might think. If you're expanding internationally, you can set up separate scans for each geo and find Australian travel influencers, French beauty creators, or Swedish sneaker reviewers - whatever you need to get more eyes on your product.</p><p> Growing SaaS companies, agencies managing multiple clients, e-commerce brands in competitive niches, and anyone who’s had enough of outdated affiliate databases.</p><ul><li>Finds 500-750+ relevant affiliates instantly</li><li>Weekly automated scans catch new opportunities</li><li>Finds emails for websites, YouTube channels, and Instagram pages</li><li>Competitor-based discovery (proven performers)</li><li>Multi-geo and multi-language support</li></ul><ul><li>No built-in affiliate tracking or payments</li><li>Requires a separate outreach tool for campaigns</li><li>Results still need a manual sense-check</li></ul><ul><li> Includes unlimited discovery, 150 email credits monthly, 1 brand analysis, 2 users</li><li> 500 email credits, 5 brands, 5 users&nbsp;</li><li> Custom pricing and packages (API, custom webhooks)</li></ul><p> If you're serious about scaling your affiliate program and have the budget for a professional tool, AffiliateFinder.ai should be your first purchase after affiliate tracking software. The competitive intelligence approach fundamentally changes how you recruit - from hoping affiliates find you to actively poaching your competitors' best partners.</p><h2><strong>2. Endorsely: Best Budget Option for SaaS</strong></h2><p> combines affiliate recruitment with full program management, wrapping it all in a pricing model that's genuinely friendly to early-stage companies: it's free until your affiliate program generates $1,000 in monthly revenue. \\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-4553c26.png\" alt=\"\">Think about that for a second. You can discover affiliates, track their performance, manage payouts, and grow your program to $12K annual revenue before spending a single dollar on the platform. Then it's just $39/month until you hit $5,000 monthly, and $99/month after that.&nbsp;</p><p>Compare this to Impact or PartnerStack charging hundreds (or thousands) per month from day one, plus transaction fees on top.</p><p>Endorsely is specifically designed to manage SaaS affiliate programs, meaning it handles subscriptions, upgrades, and recurring commissions seamlessly.</p><p>And the great thing is that it has AI-powered affiliate discovery built in, along with email enrichment.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-s763co1.png\" alt=\"\">Endorsely only covers websites and YouTube channels, so it’s not quite as comprehensive as AffiliateFinder.ai. It also lacks some features like lists and labels.</p><p>But overall, it’s fantastic value for money - and incredibly well designed - for anyone running a SaaS affiliate program.</p><p> SaaS companies launching their first affiliate program, bootstrapped startups watching every dollar, and anyone who wants discovery plus management without the enterprise price tag.</p><ul><li>Completely free until $1K monthly revenue</li><li>Full program management included</li><li>Tracks recurring subscription revenue properly</li><li>LTV analytics for customer quality insights</li><li>Simple, predictable pricing structure</li></ul><ul><li>Discovery less comprehensive than dedicated tools</li><li>Fewer features than enterprise platforms</li><li>Weekly scans not included</li><li>Not designed for e-commerce or service businesses</li></ul><ul><li> Until $1,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 15 affiliates</li><li> Up to $5,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 100 affiliates/month</li><li> Up to $20,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 250 affiliates/month</li></ul><p> If you're launching an affiliate program for a SaaS product and need both discovery and tracking,  gives you everything in one package at a price point that won't make your CFO wince. Use it to get your first 50 affiliates, then consider adding AffiliateFinder.ai when you're ready to scale aggressively.</p><h2><strong>3. Publisher Discovery: Best for Traditional Affiliate Sites</strong></h2><p>Publisher Discovery is the tool for brands that want deep data on traditional affiliate websites - the established review sites, comparison blogs, and publisher networks that have been in the game for years.</p><p>The platform integrates directly with major affiliate networks like ShareASale, CJ, and Impact, which gives it access to performance data that standalone tools can't match.&nbsp;</p><p>You can search by vertical or network, but there’s no custom discovery based on your brand.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-yo73c17.png\" alt=\"\">Publisher Discovery allows you to filter publishers by SEO metrics (domain authority, traffic volume), see which networks they're active on, and even track their performance once you recruit them.&nbsp;</p><p>This network integration is huge if you're already running programs on these platforms and want to expand beyond your current affiliate pool.</p><p>Detailed reporting includes competitor gap analysis and publisher performance benchmarking, which is helpful for identifying your top performers and helping those who are underperforming.</p><p>Who it's for: Enterprise brands working with affiliate networks, programs targeting established publishers rather than influencers, and teams that need performance data integration.</p><ul><li>Deep integration with major networks</li><li>Rich SEO and performance data</li><li>Quality-focused filtering</li><li>Performance tracking post-recruitment</li></ul><ul><li>Premium solution ($450+ per month)</li><li>Limited to affiliates registered on networks</li><li>Steeper learning curve than simpler tools</li></ul><ul><li> All features for one campaign (single geo)</li><li> Five campaigns</li><li> Unlimited campaigns</li></ul><p> combines affiliate program management with a built-in marketplace of 3 million affiliates, giving you instant access to thousands of active partners looking for new programs to promote.</p><p>The marketplace is the real draw here - over 5,000 affiliates actively browse for opportunities, and you can filter them by platform, niche, keywords, and performance metrics.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-8m83cjo.png\" alt=\"\">Instead of cold outreach, you're connecting with people who are actively seeking partnerships. I've seen programs get 20-30 quality applications within the first week of listing.</p><p>However, once you have exhausted the pool of affiliates listed on Refersion for your vertical, new ones don’t come along too often. A tool like AffiliateFinder.ai is better if you want to keep proactively discovering new opportunities every week.</p><p>Beyond discovery, Refersion handles the full program lifecycle: tracking, commission payments, tax forms (W-9s and 1099s), and automated communications.&nbsp;</p><p>The first-party cookie tracking is solid, and the platform integrates with major e-commerce platforms, making setup relatively painless.</p><p>Who it's for: E-commerce brands, D2C companies, and businesses that want a ready-made network plus management tools in one package.</p><ul><li>3M+ affiliate network with 5,000+ active partners</li><li>Full program management included</li><li>Automated commission processing and tax handling</li><li>Good filtering for marketplace affiliates</li></ul><ul><li>Transaction fees (up to 3%) on top of monthly cost</li><li>Marketplace means competing with other brands for attention</li><li>Limited pool of affiliates that doesn’t refresh quickly</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Launch ($39/month + 3% of affiliate sales):</strong> Core features, unlimited affiliates</li><li><strong>Growth ($129/month + 2% of affiliate sales):</strong> Advanced tracking, email attribution, private offers</li><li><strong>Scale ($599/month + 1% of affiliate sales):</strong> Advanced commission options, multi-store support</li></ul><h2><strong>5. Modash: Best for Influencer-Heavy Strategies</strong></h2><p>Modash indexes every social media profile with at least 1,000 followers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube - that means hundreds of millions of creators searchable through one interface.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-9x93cnp.png\" alt=\"\">The filtering is impressively robust: follower range, location, engagement rate, audience demographics, growth trends, and even fake follower detection.&nbsp;</p><p>I used it to find 50 Instagram food influencers with 5K-50K followers and minimum 3% engagement in under five minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>It even has an AI Search option so you can find recent posts of men tying their shoelaces or kids playing with toy cars.</p><p>One final touch is the influential follower check: you may have influential people following your brand already, and Modash finds them for you.</p><p>The platform includes email campaigns, tracking, and payment processing so you can manage everything in one place.</p><p>Who it's for: D2C brands prioritizing influencer partnerships, consumer product companies, and anyone focusing on social media affiliates over traditional publishers.</p><ul><li>Massive database (every profile with 1K+ followers)</li><li>Powerful filtering with 40+ criteria</li><li>Fast, intuitive interface</li></ul><ul><li>Expensive compared to some other tools</li><li>Influencer-focused (less useful for B2B or traditional affiliates)</li><li>Requires separate tracking software</li></ul><ul><li> 2 team members, 300 profiles, 150 emails</li><li><strong>Performance ($599/month):</strong> 5 team members, 800 profiles, 400 emails, broader content discovery</li><li><strong>Enterprise (custom pricing):</strong> Higher limits, more seats, payments</li></ul><p>Upfluence offers influencer discovery across all major social networks plus unique features like scanning your customer database to identify which customers are influencers.</p><p>The platform provides 20+ advanced filters to search its large creator database, with detailed metrics including audience demographics, engagement rates, and estimated sponsored post pricing.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-x7a3cck.png\" alt=\"\"> \\n The e-commerce integration lets you connect your Shopify or WooCommerce store, and Upfluence can identify existing customers with significant social followings, turning them into brand ambassadors. This is a feature I haven’t seen anywhere else, and it’s very valuable for established brands.</p><p>The affiliate tracking module lets you generate unique codes and referral links for each influencer, tracking sales back to specific creators. Combined with content management, product seeding automation, and campaign analytics, you get a true all-in-one platform.</p><p>Who it's for: Large brands with significant influencer budgets, agencies managing diverse clients, companies running complex multi-channel campaigns.</p><ul><li>Comprehensive multi-platform coverage</li><li>Customer-to-affiliate conversion feature</li><li>Rich audience data and authenticity metrics</li><li>Full campaign management included</li></ul><ul><li>Complex platform with learning curve</li><li>Overkill for pure affiliate recruitment needs</li></ul><p>Custom pricing, generally starting around $500/month with annual contracts, can exceed $1,000/month.</p><h2><strong>7. GRIN: Best for Enterprise Influencer Programs</strong></h2><p>GRIN is an enterprise-grade creator management platform with affiliate capabilities, designed for brands managing hundreds of influencer relationships simultaneously with AI-powered automation.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-49b3cez.png\" alt=\"\">The platform's AI assistant \"Gia\" suggests optimal creators, predicts performance, and automates routine tasks like follow-ups and content tracking.&nbsp;</p><p>You get complete lifecycle management: discovery, product seeding, content approvals, affiliate link tracking, and payment processing - all in one system. The relationship CRM tracks every conversation, content piece, and product shipment per creator.</p><p>The affiliate module generates unique codes and links for each influencer, tracking sales and automatically calculating commissions.&nbsp;</p><p>For brands running hybrid influencer-affiliate programs at scale, GRIN removes the operational chaos and tracks everything in one manageable place.</p><p>The only downside is that GRIN is focused on social media creators, so you’ll need to pair it with another platform if you want to partner with bloggers too.</p><p>Who it's for: Large D2C brands, major e-commerce companies, agencies with significant influencer budgets (think 100+ active partnerships).</p><ul><li>AI automation (Gia) for optimization and suggestions</li><li>Complete creator lifecycle management</li><li>Product seeding and content management</li><li>Robust analytics and reporting</li></ul><ul><li>One of the most expensive options ($1,000-$2,500+/month)</li><li>Annual contracts required</li><li>Overkill for smaller programs</li></ul><p>Custom pricing starts at around $1,000 per month.</p><p>Influencers Club gives you searchable access to 200M+ influencer profiles across more than 30 platforms, including Spotify and Udemy.&nbsp;</p><p>This broad range of coverage means you can often find creators who don’t show up on bigger platforms like Instagram and YouTube.</p><p>The 40+ advanced filters let you narrow by platform, follower count, location, engagement rate, posting frequency, and even specific bio keywords.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-okc3cm2.png\" alt=\"\">Each creator listed already has a verified email, which is good for easy outreach but may exclude some great opportunities without an email on record.</p><p>On the API plan, you’re able to use Influencers Club data to enrich your own list of emails or usernames. There’s also the option for a fully managed plan where their team takes care of the outreach for you.</p><p>Who it's for: Influencer-focused brands running targeted campaigns across multiple platforms</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Influencer-heavy (less for traditional publishers)</li><li>No website/blogger discovery</li><li>Limited to creators with emails</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Dashboard (from $199/month):</strong> Discovery and outreach for 200M+ creators with emails</li><li><strong>API + Dashboard (from $249/month):</strong> Includes API access, bulk data, enrichment</li><li> Fully managed outreach service</li></ul><p>Partnerbase is a free public directory of 147,000+ companies and 456,000+ B2B partnerships, making it a valuable research tool for identifying potential affiliate relationships.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/9gHwxzGv0uNfeSQx3w6794cB5gu1-lld3cnf.png\" alt=\"\">While not specifically an affiliate recruitment platform, Partnerbase helps you understand the partnership landscape in your industry.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see which companies have affiliate programs, research competitors' partner ecosystems, and identify businesses that might be good affiliate partners based on their existing relationships.</p><p>The real value is in research and intelligence rather than direct recruitment. Use it to identify companies worth approaching, understand what partner programs exist in adjacent spaces, and find opportunities for strategic affiliate partnerships beyond typical content creators.</p><p>Who it's for: B2B companies on tight budgets, researchers mapping partnership landscapes, anyone needing free competitive intelligence.</p><ul><li>Completely free with registration</li><li>456,000+ partnerships indexed</li><li>Helps identify affiliate program opportunities</li></ul><ul><li>Requires manual follow-up work</li><li>Limited compared to paid tools</li></ul><ul><li> Complete access with registration</li></ul><p>Picking the right recruitment tool isn't about finding the \"best\" option - it's about matching your specific situation to the right solution. Here's how to think through the decision.</p><p>Let's do the math that actually matters. If you're an affiliate manager making $60K annually ($30/hour), and manual recruitment takes 20 hours weekly, that's $600/week or $2,400/month of your time. A tool like  at $99/month that saves 75% of that time creates $1,800/month in value - an 18x return.</p><p>Even tools that seem expensive like GRIN at $1,500/month can justify themselves if you're managing 100+ influencer relationships. That's $15 per relationship monthly for complete automation. Without it, you'd need to hire another full-time person.</p><p> like Partnerbase and Endorsely's free tier make sense when you're validating whether an affiliate channel works for your business. But once you have proof of concept, the time savings from paid tools become obvious.</p><p><strong>Launching (0-10 affiliates):</strong> Start with manual research and outreach within your network. Focus on proving the channel works before investing heavily in discovery tools.</p><p><strong>Early Growth (10-50 affiliates):</strong> Add AffiliateFinder.ai Pro at $99/month. The competitor intelligence approach helps you reach quality at this stage when every partnership matters.</p><p><strong>Scaling (50-200 affiliates):</strong> Upgrade to AffiliateFinder.ai Agency or add specialized tools like Modash for influencers. Consider Refersion if marketplace access speeds up recruitment.</p><p><strong>Enterprise (200+ affiliates):</strong> GRIN, Upfluence, or other enterprise platforms start making sense. You need sophisticated management alongside discovery. You may want to keep AffiliateFinder.ai to make sure you never run out of new opportunities.</p><p>The type of affiliate you want to target makes a difference to the tool you choose. Here’s what I recommend:</p><p><strong>Traditional publishers and bloggers:</strong> AffiliateFinder.ai, Publisher Discovery, or Endorsely. These tools excel at finding web content creators.</p><p><strong>Instagram/TikTok influencers:</strong> Modash, Influencers Club, or Upfluence. You need social-first databases with engagement metrics.</p><p> AffiliateFinder.ai (for the email finder specifically) or Modash.

Before a human ever looks at an application, algorithms have already parsed a borrower’s history, payments, and even digital behavior. What used to be a snapshot of credit has become a live feed, a constantly updated record of financial trust.</p><p>According to Experian’s 2023 State of Alternative Credit Data Report, <a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/2023-state-of-alternative-credit-data/\">62%</a> of financial institutions surveyed reported current or planned use of expanded data for risk profiling. This marks a clear shift away from static credit scoring and toward real-time, data-driven verification.</p><p>Behind that feed sits an ecosystem much larger than the three credit bureaus we know by name. Dozens of companies now specialize in alternative data, digital verification, and predictive modeling, each one shaping how risk is measured.</p><p>In this networked system, your financial identity moves faster than you do. Every rent payment, late bill, or new account echoes through databases that talk to one another in real time. Those signals determine not only whether you’re approved, but how much you’ll pay to borrow.</p><p>For consumers with limited or uneven credit history, understanding that invisible system isn’t optional, but it’s truly become the first step toward seeing how credit really works in 2025.</p><h2>The Legacy System Still Sets the Benchmark</h2><p>For decades, three credit bureaus, namely Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, have defined how risk is measured in the United States. They collect records on everything from payment history to credit limits and defaults, creating the data backbone that powers most lending models. Nearly every loan decision still starts with a pull from at least one of these sources, filtered through scoring formulas like FICO or VantageScore.</p><p>Each bureau operates its own network, which means your score can fluctuate depending on who’s checking. Credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, and auto finance companies feed data back into these systems every month, reinforcing a cycle that’s both precise and narrow. When a lender talks about “creditworthiness,” they’re referring to this data loop, a closed system built on reported borrowing behavior.</p><p>But that loop leaves a blind spot. Traditional credit models rely on a small set of signals: cards, loans, and payment timelines. For millions of Americans without those records, the result is the same: no score, no access. According to the <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/language/cfpb-in-english/credit-reports-and-scores-key-terms/\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, 26 million Americans are “credit invisible,” and another 19 million have unscorable files, roughly 45 million consumers who may be denied access to mainstream credit.</p><p>Some analysts argue that this dependence on decades-old infrastructure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/credit-without-borders-can-a-decentralized-credit-network-replace-traditional-credit-bureaus\">limits innovation and inclusion</a>, prompting a gradual shift toward more decentralized, data-rich verification systems. That change is what gave rise to today’s alternative-data ecosystem: a new layer of financial intelligence designed to measure trust where traditional systems see nothing at all.</p><h2>Alternative Data Is Redrawing the Credit Map</h2><p>For millions of borrowers with limited credit history, traditional scores don’t tell the full story. Payment habits, rent records, and recurring bills often reveal more about financial reliability than a single credit card statement ever could. That’s where alternative data networks step in , systems designed to read signals that old models ignore.</p><p> in this space include:</p><ul><li><strong>LexisNexis Risk Solutions</strong>: Builds financial profiles from public records, utility accounts, and identity data.</li><li>: Tracks short-term and payday lending activity.</li><li>: Deliver real-time feeds of subprime credit performance.</li></ul><p>Together, they form a parallel data layer: one that measures consistency, not just credit access.</p><p>Some of these networks connect through specialized reporting systems such as Teletrack, a platform that compiles alternative credit data from non-prime lenders. For readers wondering “?”: It’s a consumer reporting agency now owned by Equifax that gathers information from short-term and subprime lenders, including payday loan history, employment records, and payment behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike traditional credit bureaus, Teletrack focuses specifically on high-risk or limited-credit borrowers, helping lenders identify repayment patterns and risk profiles that fall outside standard credit models.</p><p>Although this information doesn’t always reach the major bureaus, it increasingly feeds into approval algorithms. By mapping spending and repayment behavior across nontraditional channels, from rent to cash-app transfers, these providers extend visibility to borrowers who were previously excluded from mainstream finance.</p><h2>Lenders Rely on Aggregated Decision Engines</h2><p>Before a loan is approved or denied, the decision rarely comes from a single score. Modern underwriting runs on decision engines with systems that pull live data from multiple sources, apply algorithms, and return a credit decision in seconds. These engines have become the invisible core of digital lending, translating a borrower’s financial activity into probability models of repayment.</p><h3>How Decision Engines Actually Work</h3><p>Instead of relying on one bureau report, lenders feed a mix of inputs into a unified model:</p><ul><li> Traditional score files remain part of the stack, but they’re blended with live transaction and behavioral data to create a fuller picture of financial health.</li><li> Employment data, bank-verified deposits, or gig-economy pay stubs.</li><li> Recurring subscriptions, rent, and utilities.</li><li> Payment timing, cash-flow predictability, or spending volatility.</li></ul><p>Each data type is weighted by an algorithm trained to balance risk, profitability, and inclusion. The result isn’t a score but a decision probability, and how likely an applicant is to repay within a given time horizon.</p><p>The shift to real-time decisioning is powered by open-banking APIs. Platforms like <a href=\"https://plaid.com/home/us/\">Plaid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yodlee.com/\">Yodlee</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.finicity.com/security/\">Finicity</a> connect directly to applicants’ bank accounts through secure data pipes.</p><ul><li>They confirm income consistency and identify sudden balance drops or irregular deposits.</li><li>They flag recurring bills or overdrafts, turning raw transactions into dynamic financial profiles.</li><li>They replace static statements with live telemetry of cash flow.</li></ul><p>According to a 2025 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X24001739\">ScienceDirect study</a>, fintech firms are increasingly using these platforms to access customer bank data for underwriting, even in markets without full open-banking regulation. Meanwhile, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston describes how open-banking APIs now serve as “<a href=\"https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/payment-strategies/modernizing-us-financial-services-with-open-banking-and-apis\">central hubs</a>” in financial networks, enabling the secure, consumer-authorized transfer of account data.</p><p>This live connectivity has become a defining feature of 2025-era lending: underwriting based on what a borrower is doing now, not what they did months ago.</p><h3>Advanced Technologies Behind the Decision Layer</h3><p>Decision engines increasingly use machine learning to update credit models in real time. Platforms can analyze thousands of signals per applicant, from income stability to behavioral biometrics, to detect both opportunity and risk.</p><ul><li><strong>Geolocation and device fingerprinting</strong> help verify identity and prevent synthetic-fraud attacks.</li><li> track subtle user patterns, such as typing rhythm or navigation speed, to distinguish legitimate users from bots.</li><li> continually retrain models, improving accuracy as new repayment data arrives.</li></ul><p>As AI Magazine reports, companies like Zest AI are enabling “<a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/ai-applications/how-zest-ai-enables-fair-and-transparent-lending-with-ai\">fair and transparent lending</a>” by automating credit assessments and using explainable models to improve both speed and inclusion.</p><p>The goal isn’t only faster decisions, but it’s smarter inclusion. Each data point refines how risk is measured, letting more people qualify without loosening standards.</p><h3>The Algorithmic Middle Layer of Lending</h3><p>In many institutions, these decision engines now form a new operational layer, sitting between human underwriters and legacy credit bureaus. They interpret incoming data, flag anomalies, and feed insights back to both compliance and risk teams.</p><p>This algorithmic middle layer is what allows fintech lenders to scale: decisions that once took days now happen in seconds, with audit trails and explainability dashboards built in.</p><p>The rise of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) platforms has added a new layer to consumer credit finance. Services have extended short-term credit at the point of sale, effectively creating micro-loans that bypass traditional revolving accounts. For years, these transactions existed outside the major credit bureaus, but that’s changing fast.</p><p>Some BNPL providers now share repayment data with bureaus that enables users to build or repair credit profiles through consistent on-time payments. This gradual shift is redefining what counts as “credit history” in the modern ecosystem.</p><p>What makes BNPL data so valuable is its behavioral precision. Platforms track not just repayment, but timing, frequency, and transaction context, how often users finance purchases, and how quickly they settle them. Combined with predictive analytics, these insights feed into the same decision engines that power digital lending.</p><p>According to the CFPB, in 2022 <a href=\"https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_BNPL_Report_2025_01.pdf\">more than one‐fifth</a> of U.S. consumers with a credit record used BNPL financing, and regulatory scrutiny is rising as policymakers push for standardized reporting to improve transparency.</p><p>As data-sharing expands, the boundary between BNPL and traditional finance continues to blur, connecting previously invisible spending patterns to the wider credit system. For millions of consumers, that connection marks the difference between invisibility and eligibility.</p><h2>The New Architecture of Credit</h2><p>The evolution of consumer credit finance is no longer about a single score. It’s about data architecture, a living system where real-time signals replace static records, and inclusion depends on visibility, not legacy.</p><p>Traditional credit bureaus still define much of the infrastructure, but they now operate within a larger, decentralized web that includes alternative data providers, open-banking APIs, and AI-driven decision engines. Each node in that network, whether it’s a Teletrack record, an income-verification feed, or a BNPL repayment, contributes a data point to a growing portrait of financial trust.</p><p>This interconnectedness is reshaping both sides of lending. For lenders, it means sharper risk intelligence and faster approvals. For consumers, it means that every verified action like every rent payment, utility bill, or BNPL installment, can become part of a transparent financial identity.</p><p>Credit has become a network effect, and understanding that network of who collects, connects, and calculates your data, is now the first step toward unlocking smarter, fairer access to finance in 2025 and beyond.</p>","contentLength":12041,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Scenes from TechCrunch Disrupt 2025","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/scenes-from-techcrunch-disrupt/","date":1761883353,"author":"Connie Loizos","guid":102599,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Thanks to everyone who made this year's San Francisco event what it was -- and to the 10,000 of you who filled the halls, made the connections, and left with more than you came with.

The leak follows others obtained and verified by 404 Media over the last 18 months. Those leaks impacted both Cellebrite and its competitor Grayshift, now owned by Magnet Forensics. Both companies constantly hunt for techniques to unlock phones law enforcement have physical access to.\n \n\"You can Teams meeting with them. They tell everything. Still cannot extract esim on Pixel. Ask anything,\" a user called rogueFed wrote on the GrapheneOS forum on Wednesday, speaking about what they learned about Cellebrite capabilities. GrapheneOS is a security- and privacy-focused Android-based operating system. rogueFed then posted two screenshots of the Microsoft Teams call. The first was a Cellebrite Support Matrix, which lays out whether the company's tech can, or can't, unlock certain phones and under what conditions. The second screenshot was of a Cellebrite employee. According to another of rogueFed's posts, the meeting took place in October. The meeting appears to have been a sales call. The employee is a \"pre sales expert,\" according to a profile available online.\n \nThe Support Matrix is focused on modern Google Pixel devices, including the Pixel 9 series. The screenshot does not include details on the Pixel 10, which is Google's latest device. It discusses Cellebrite's capabilities regarding 'before first unlock', or BFU, when a piece of phone unlocking tech tries to open a device before someone has typed in the phone's passcode for the first time since being turned on. It also shows Cellebrite's capabilities against after first unlock, or AFU, devices. The Support Matrix also shows Cellebrite's capabilities against Pixel devices running GrapheneOS, with some differences between phones running that operating system and stock Android. Cellebrite does support, for example, Pixel 9 devices BFU. Meanwhile the screenshot indicates Cellebrite cannot unlock Pixel 9 devices running GrapheneOS BFU.
