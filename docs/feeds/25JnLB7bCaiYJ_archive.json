However, last week, FaunaDB announced that it would sunset its database services. FaunaDB said it plans to release an open-source version of its core database technology. The system stores data in JSON documents but retains relational features like consistency, support for joins and foreign keys, and full schema enforcement. Fauna's query language, FQL, will also be made available to the open-source community. \"Driving broad based adoption of a new operational database that runs as a service globally is very capital intensive. In the current market environment, our board and investors have determined that it is not possible to raise the capital needed to achieve that goal independently,\" the leadership team said.\n \n\"While we will no longer be accepting new customers, existing Fauna customers will experience no immediate change.

The filing shows how dangerous it is to provide your DNA directly to a large, for-profit commercial genetic database; 23andMe is now looking for a buyer to pull it out of bankruptcy. 23andMe said in court documents viewed by 404 Media that since hackers obtained personal data about seven million of its customers in October 2023, including, in some cases \"health-related information based upon the user's genetics,\" it has faced \"over 50 class action and state court lawsuits,\" and that \"approximately 35,000 claimants have initiated, filed, or threatened to commence arbitration claims against the company.\" It is seeking bankruptcy protection in part to simplify the fallout of these legal cases, and because it believes it may not have money to pay for the potential damages associated with these cases.\n \nCEO and cofounder Anne Wojcicki announced she is leaving the company as part of this process. The company has the genetic data of more than 15 million customers. According to its Chapter 11 filing, 23andMe owes money to a host of pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, artificial intelligence companies (including a company called Aganitha AI and Coreweave), as well as health insurance companies and marketing companies. Shortly before the filing, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued an \"urgent\" alert to 23andMe customers: \"Given 23andMe's reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company.\"\n \nIn a letter to customers Sunday, 23andMe said: \"Your data remains protected.

Management proposes building the Future Circular Collider (FCC), a machine with a 90-kilometer circumference that would smash particles at eight times the energy of the LHC. This hugely consequential plan faces significant challenges. Much of the required technology doesn't exist yet, including superconducting magnets strong enough to bend high-energy particle beams. \n\nThe project also lacks the clear rationale that the LHC had in finding the Higgs boson. The proposal has divided physicists. Critics worry about the decades-long timeline, potential cost overruns, and the risk of sacrificing other valuable CERN activities. Germany, which provides 20% of the lab's budget, has already indicated it won't increase contributions. A council-appointed group is now gathering input from the physics community before making recommendations in December. \n\nNature's editorial board adds: Unless some nations step up with a major infusion of cash, the FCC faces an uncertain prospect of being funded. But waiting too long could mean that there will be a large gap between the new facility opening and the closure of the LHC, and precious expertise could end up being lost. \n\nAlthough physicists might disagree on what CERN should do, they nearly unanimously care about the lab's future. They and their leaders must now make the case for why European taxpayers, who fund most of the lab's yearly budget should care, too. The stakes are beyond science, and even beyond Europe.","contentLength":1603,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How a Nephew's CD Burner Inspired Early Valve To Embrace DRM","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/03/24/1939209/how-a-nephews-cd-burner-inspired-early-valve-to-embrace-drm?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742845200,"author":"msmash","guid":13384,"unread":true,"content":"Valve's early anti-piracy efforts, which eventually led to the Steam platform, were sparked by co-founder Monica Harrington's nephew using her money to buy a CD burner for copying games, she revealed at last week's Game Developers Conference.

Customers now expect personalized interactions and rapid responses tailored to their specific needs, making tools like predictive analytics invaluable.</p><p>\\\nPredictive analytics harnesses historical data to forecast future customer behaviors and preferences. This capability allows businesses to accurately anticipate customer needs, facilitating more personalized and proactive engagement. By embedding predictive analytics within Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, companies can not only meet but exceed customer expectations, thereby driving satisfaction and loyalty.</p><p>\\\nWithin this sphere, Chitrapradha Ganesan stands out as a crucial contributor. With over 18 years of dedicated experience in the CRM domain, she has a rich background in leveraging data-driven insights to enhance customer interaction. Currently a Senior Member Technical Staff at Salesforce, Chitrapradha applies her expertise in predictive analytics to boost customer satisfaction.</p><p>Early in her career, Chitrapradha recognized the transformative power of predictive analytics in Customer Relationship Management. With over 19 years in the IT sector and a major focus on CRM for 18 of those years, she has worked across major platforms like Oracle CRM and Salesforce CRM. Her journey began with roles involving extensive data interactions and client management solutions.</p><p>\\\nDuring these formative years, Chitrapradha identified the potential of data-driven insights for personalizing customer engagement and anticipating their needs. Reflecting on this pivotal moment, she shares, \"I recognized that data-driven insights could play a crucial role in anticipating customer needs, leading to more personalized and effective engagement.\"</p><p>\\\nThis realization not only guided her professional path but also influenced her educational pursuits. She has completed a postgraduate program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, she continues to refine her expertise. Driven by a vision to merge data analytics with customer satisfaction, Chitrapradha utilizes her extensive technical background to devise scalable, high-performance solutions that cater to evolving CRM needs.</p><h3><strong>Understanding Predictive Analytics</strong></h3><p>At its core, predictive analytics involves leveraging historical data to forecast future outcomes. This approach employs a range of statistical techniques—including data mining, machine learning, and predictive modeling—to analyze current and historical facts, enabling organizations to make informed predictions about future events. Companies use these insights to anticipate customer behaviors and preferences, thereby customizing their services to meet future demands.</p><p>\\\nChitrapradha, with her extensive background in CRM and data analytics, breaks down the process succinctly. Businesses gather customer data from multiple sources like past purchases, browsing history, and interactions with customer service. This data feeds into predictive models that employ algorithms to identify patterns and trends, helping businesses anticipate future customer needs or preferences.</p><p>\\\n\"For example, if a customer frequently buys a certain type of product,\" Chitrapradha notes, \"the model might predict when they will make their next purchase and suggest similar products they might be interested in.\" The utility of predictive analytics in CRM is vast. By meticulously analyzing historical data, companies can pinpoint customer segments exhibiting specific behaviors, foresee potential churn, and even predict the success rate of marketing campaigns. This process involves several steps, from data collection and cleaning to the application of sophisticated algorithms that yield actionable insights.</p><h3><strong>Anticipating Customer Needs and Preferences</strong></h3><p>Predictive analytics excels at anticipating customer needs with remarkable accuracy. By analyzing historical data, businesses can uncover patterns and trends that predict future behaviors. This technique involves collecting data from various touch points—such as past purchases, online browsing history, and customer service interactions—and feeding it into sophisticated predictive models. These models, powered by machine learning algorithms, then generate insights on likely customer preferences and future needs.</p><p>\\\nChitrapradha leverages a range of techniques and tools to realize these predictions. In her role, she utilizes Salesforce's native AI capabilities, including Einstein GPT, to automate and refine the process of anticipating customer needs. \"Predictive analytics helps businesses anticipate customer needs and preferences by analyzing historical data to identify patterns and trends that indicate future behaviors,\" she explains. These tools enable real-time data processing and the generation of actionable insights, allowing businesses to engage customers more effectively. By analyzing a customer's buying patterns, predictive models can foresee their next purchase and suggest related products, boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty through personalized engagement.</p><h3><strong>Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability in Predictive Models</strong></h3><p>In predictive analytics, the accuracy and reliability of models are paramount. Chitrapradha stresses the importance of starting with high-quality data, which forms the foundation of any predictive model. \"High-quality data ensures that the predictive models produce accurate and actionable insights, which are essential for making informed business decisions,\" she explains. She advocates for a robust data governance framework involving regular data cleansing, validation, and enrichment processes to eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and outdated information. Consistent data collection across all touchpoints and centralized storage are also crucial to avoiding data silos.</p><p>\\\nDeveloping reliable predictive models doesn't stop with high-quality data. Chitrapradha outlines the necessity of rigorous testing and validation before deployment. This includes running models on historical data to assess prediction accuracy and making necessary adjustments. Continuous monitoring and updating of models to account for changing customer behaviors and market conditions are essential. These practices ensure that predictive models remain reliable and effective in forecasting customer behaviors and preferences.</p><h3><strong>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</strong></h3><p>One primary challenge in integrating predictive analytics into CRM systems is ensuring data quality. Chitrapradha emphasizes that incomplete or outdated data can compromise predictive model reliability. \"If the data used is incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate, the predictive models will produce unreliable results,\" she explains. Businesses must invest in robust data management practices, including regular data cleansing and validation.</p><p>\\\nAnother significant challenge is the complexity of integrating predictive analytics with existing CRM systems. Legacy infrastructures often lack the flexibility needed to incorporate advanced analytics seamlessly. Businesses must opt for adaptable, scalable analytics solutions that integrate smoothly with their current technology stack. Adequate training and highlighting the tangible benefits of predictive analytics can also help mitigate resistance to change within organizations.</p><p>\\\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the use of predictive analytics in CRM systems raises critical data privacy concerns. Predictive analytics relies heavily on collecting and analyzing customer data, which brings up issues of data management and protection. Businesses must navigate these ethical waters with care, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining transparency with customers about data usage. The potential for data misuse necessitates rigorous internal policies to uphold ethical standards and foster customer trust.</p><h3><strong>Tracking Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty</strong></h3><p>In the realm of Customer Relationship Management, quantifying customer satisfaction and loyalty is crucial. “Customer satisfaction can be measured through surveys, feedback forms, and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) before and after the implementation of predictive analytics,” Chitrapradha explains. This approach allows businesses to track real-time responses and sentiments, with shifts in these scores providing valuable insights into how well the predictive models are meeting customer needs.</p><p>\\\nBeyond satisfaction, metrics evaluating customer loyalty are equally important. Customer retention rates reflect ongoing engagement, while repeat purchase rates offer insights into consistent customer behaviors. By analyzing these trends, companies can gauge how effectively their predictive analytics initiatives are fostering stronger customer connections and increasing loyalty.</p><h3><strong>The Future of Predictive Analytics in CRM</strong></h3><p>Chitrapradha envisions a future where predictive analytics plays an even more integral role in CRM systems. She anticipates advancements in real-time data processing, enabling businesses to anticipate and respond to customer needs almost instantaneously.</p><p>\\\nLooking ahead, Chitrapradha highlights, \"The incorporation of predictive analytics with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), will enable a more holistic and personalized customer experience.\" This evolution in technology will pave the way for CRM systems that are more tailored, responsive, and capable of delivering enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty through increasingly accurate predictions.</p><p>\\\nOur exploration of predictive analytics in enhancing customer experience highlights the significant impact of data-driven insights. From anticipating customer needs to optimizing engagement strategies, predictive analytics enables companies to connect with their customers on a more personal and effective level. Chitrapradha’s work exemplifies the potential of these tools to transform CRM systems and drive improvements in customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p><p>\\\nFor businesses considering adopting predictive analytics, the message is clear: the investment is not just in technology but in a more personalized, responsive, and effective customer relationship strategy. As Chitrapradha’s vision suggests, the true potential of predictive analytics lies in fostering deeper customer connections and driving sustained loyalty. The future is bright for companies willing to embrace these insights and the tremendous value they bring to customer experience management.</p>","contentLength":10649,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI Will Impact GDP of Every Country By Double Digits, Says Mistral CEO","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/03/24/1527230/ai-will-impact-gdp-of-every-country-by-double-digits-says-mistral-ceo?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742829960,"author":"msmash","guid":12810,"unread":true,"content":"Countries must develop their own artificial intelligence infrastructure or risk significant economic losses as the technology transforms global economies, Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said last week. \n\n\"It will have an impact on GDP of every country in the double digits in the coming years,\" Mensch told the A16z podcast, warning that nations without domestic AI systems would see capital flow elsewhere.

It determines which transactions get included in a block and in what order, directly impacting network efficiency, decentralization, and fairness. Over time, Ethereum’s block production process has evolved, especially with the growing role of MEV and the shift from validator-driven selection to specialized builders.</p><p>This post will discuss how Ethereum Block Building has evolved along with the introduction of Proposer Builder Separation and future research.</p><p><strong>Ethereum organizes time into discrete units:</strong></p><ul><li> A slot is a 12-second period in which a single block can be proposed. If no validator submits a block within a slot, it is skipped.</li><li> An epoch consists of 32 slots, totaling .</li></ul><p>\\\nAt the end of each epoch, validator duties are shuffled to ensure decentralization and security. Ethereum achieves economic finality after , after which it is near impossible to revert the blocks.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/271-stories-to-learn-about-ethereum\">Ethereum</a> has a huge number of Validators in the network. At the time of writing, there are 1,051,349 active validators as per <a href=\"https://beaconcha.in/charts/validators\">beaconcha.in</a> It would be infeasible if this many validators had to verify each block every 12 seconds. Hence, validators are divided into  to efficiently validate transactions and attest to block validity.</p><ul><li>Consists of a subset of validators randomly assigned at the beginning of an epoch using RANDAO.</li><li>Ensures that no single validator has disproportionate influence.</li><li>Participates in voting (attesting) on blocks and confirming their validity.</li></ul><p>\\\nThe size of a committee depends on the total number of active validators in the network but generally, each committee has at least 128 validators.</p><ul><li><p>There are lets say  Committees assigned per slot and lets say there are  Validators in each Committee(where  &gt;128). This means there are  attestations for each slot. As you can understand, it can quickly become overwhelming for the network to gossip this many attestations.</p></li><li><p>Aggregators in each Committee are tasked with aggregating the attestations of their respective Committee. This means out of a Committee of  Validators. there is only 1 final  instead of .</p></li><li><p>So in each slot, there are a final of  Attestations(1 for each committee of that slot) being gossiped to the global topic. The Proposer of the next slot picks up these  attestations.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Some points to keep in mind</strong></p><ul><li><p>During an epoch, every active validator is a member of exactly one committee, so all the epoch's committees are disjoint.</p></li><li><p>The protocol adjusts the total number of committees in each epoch according to the number of active validators.</p></li><li><p>Current design is to have  Committees per slot i.e. </p></li></ul><p>The beacon chain shuffling is designed to provide a minimum of  lookahead on the validator's upcoming committee assignments for attesting dictated by the shuffling and slot.  that this lookahead does not apply to proposing, which must be checked during the epoch in question.</p><p>\\\n&nbsp;can be called at the start of each epoch to get the assignment for the next epoch (). This also allows validators to calculate the subnet id, join the respective committee, and be prepared for their duties.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, a Validator might be assigned as the  of a specific committee. If so, they must subscribe to the respective topic as well.</p><h3><strong>Proposer Responsibilities</strong></h3><p>Within each slot, a <strong>single validator from the respective committee</strong> is selected as the  to create and submit a block.</p><p>The proposer’s role is crucial as they:</p><ul><li>Construct a block by including pending transactions and attestations.</li><li>Sign and broadcast the  to the network.</li><li>Earn rewards for successfully proposing valid blocks.</li></ul><p>MEV is the additional profit extracted by validators (formerly miners) by reordering, including, or censoring the transactions within a block. </p><p>\\\nSome common MEV strategies are:</p><ul><li>: Placing a trade just before a known profitable transaction. Frontrunning is also deemed as toxic MEV since it surprises the user with a negative effect.</li><li>: Executing a transaction right after a specific event (e.g., arbitrage bots).</li><li>: A combination of front-running and back-running, especially in DeFi trades.</li></ul><ul><li>: When validators controlled block production, they had full discretion over transaction ordering and could directly extract MEV.</li><li>: Independent actors who scan the mempool for MEV opportunities and submit transactions accordingly.</li><li>: After PBS, block builders take on the role of constructing MEV-optimized blocks, while validators simply select blocks from the highest bidder.</li></ul><h2><strong>Block Building Pre-PBS: Validator-Centric MEV</strong></h2><p>Before Ethereum transitioned to PBS, the proposer(formerly miners in PoW) had <strong>full control over transaction ordering</strong>. This created an ecosystem where MEV was directly extracted by validators or outsourced to specialized searchers.</p><ol><li>: Transactions are broadcast as usual and enter the mempool.</li><li>Validators handpicked transactions from the mempool. These could be ordered by something called  which is fees the user is willing to pay to get included first. It could also be ordered in a way the Validator makes more revenue(through sandwich/frontrunning)..</li><li>The Validator builds the block based using the transactions they picked.</li><li>: The signed block is broadcast to the network.</li></ol><p>This is somewhat loosely abstracted to simplify. But this was the general flow. This can be termed as </p><h3><strong>Problems With Pre-PBS Block Building</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Centralization of MEV Power</strong>: Large validators had an economic advantage over smaller ones due to their ability to extract MEV more efficiently.</li><li><strong>Increased Censorship Risk</strong>: Validators could choose to exclude transactions that did not align with their financial incentives.</li><li><strong>Network Congestion &amp; High Gas Fees</strong>: The bidding wars for MEV transactions led to inefficient block space utilization, increasing costs for regular users.</li></ul><h2><strong>Block Building Post-PBS: Separation of Proposers &amp; Builders</strong></h2><p>To address the centralization risks and inefficiencies of validator-controlled block construction, <strong>Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS)</strong> was introduced. PBS splits the responsibilities of block production between two separate entities:</p><ol><li>: Entities specializing in constructing optimized blocks, often incorporating MEV strategies.</li><li><strong>Block Proposers (Validators)</strong>: Validators no longer build blocks themselves; they simply select the most profitable block offered by builders.</li></ol><ol><li><strong>Builders Construct Blocks</strong>: Block builders compete to construct the most profitable block, factoring in MEV extraction opportunities.</li><li><strong>Bidding for Block Inclusion</strong>: Builders bid to propose their block to validators, ensuring that validators receive the most profitable option.</li><li><strong>Validators Select the Highest Bid</strong>: Instead of selecting individual transactions, validators simply choose the highest-bidding builder’s block, maximizing their rewards.</li></ol><h2>How Ethereum block building works now</h2><ol><li><p>User submits transaction via JSON-RPC connected wallet.</p></li><li><p>This transaction is submitted into the public mempool. All transactions are dumped here before they are picked up and validated. Recently,  have taken center stage with most big players opting for this since it is workaround to broadcasting your transactions to the public by using permissioned/private channels. Checkout the dashboard on <a href=\"https://dune.com/dataalways/private-order-flow\">Dune</a> for more insights.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p>  → who are external entities scanning the mempool continuously to find MEV opportunities(). They fetch the respective transactions and insert their own if and when necessary to make a profit. Then, the create a bundle of these transactions, the order of which must be maintained throughout in order for the Searcher to make a profit. Bundles are ordered transactions that must be executed atomically. Along with this bundle, they may add a transaction at the end of the bundle which denotes a “bribe” to the Builder. This bundle is sent to the Builder through the  call.</p><p>: Searchers are external entities and influence transaction ordering but do not participate in block validation or consensus decisions.</p></li><li><p> →The next entity is the Builder, who actually builds the block. They try to maximize both the fee revenue as well as MEV revenue. They include the bundled transactions sent by the Searchers(hopefully in order) and accept the payment(bribe) sent by the Searchers. Builders construct execution payloads using received transactions. </p><p><strong>They fill the blocks with:</strong></p></li><li><p>Bundles sent by the Searchers.</p></li><li><p>High-priority transactions.</p></li><li><p>Order general transactions keeping in mind to maximize the revenue.</p><p>They also set the field  to their own address signifying that they will receive both the Searcher bribes as well as all the fees from the transactions in their submitted block.&nbsp;Builders submit a transaction at the end of their block which serves as a bribe to the proposer similar to what the Searcher did for the Builder.</p></li></ol><p>:::info\n   : Builders are external entities and do not directly interact with the blockchain.</p><ol start=\"5\"><li><p> → The Builder market is a competitive market with various builders wanting their payloads to get finalized to earn the fees. However, most blocks are built by a few well-known Block Builders, namely  and  To simplify this process for the actual Proposer, Relays are intermediary entities that validate the payloads sent by the various Builders and choose the one with the maximum profit/bid. The Relay-Proposer communication uses a neat trick similar to a Commit and Reveal to ensure the Proposer does not cheat every entity till this point. More <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-block-building-the-hidden-economy-behind-every-transaction?source=rss#relay-proposer-communication\">here</a>.</p></li></ol><p>It is entirely possible that on receiving the block payload, the proposer unwraps the block, inserts their transactions, and changes the ordering to their own liking as well as set the   to their own address. This would mean every single entity that worked on the block-building process till now(Searcher → Builder → Relay) will be cheated or do “MEV stealing”. To prevent this, the Relay sends only the Header of the selected Block Payload. This happens when the proposer makes the  call. The Relay now sends a  which contains the hash of the body, the bid, and the signature of the builder.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The proposer has 2 options at this point:</strong></p><ul><li><p>To select the  (also called ) provided by the Relay. If so, the proposer must sign the header with their key and send it back to the Relay and consequently request the  using the  call. Now the Relay executes the  call which returns the entire  to the proposer. The Proposer then simply proposes this block to the Ethereum Validator network or more specifically to the committee they have been assigned to.</p></li><li><p>The Proposer may choose not to accept the   sent by the Relay, in which case they must build the block themselves. This includes finding MEV opportunities and ordering transactions accordingly. Of course, in this case, the Proposer gets to keep the entire revenue from the fees + MEV. However, this is not as simple as it seems. Finding MEV and optimizing revenue is a fairly computation-heavy task and there is the possibility that the proposer may not be able to build the block in time(12 seconds), hence there will be a missed slot. In this scenario, the proposer may be slashed from the network.</p></li></ul><h2>But in Case 1, what if the Proposer does not send the block sent by the Relay?</h2><p>Well, the proposer is required to sign the  for this exact reason. Before sending the Header, the Relay sends the  to a  for safekeeping. Once the Relay receives the signed  from the proposer, it verifies the signature and sends the  stored in the escrow to the Proposer. Now, let’s say the proposer does not include this Block. It builds its own block, ignoring the ordering done thus far. In this case, the signature will not match since the headers have changed.</p><p>:::info\n: <strong>It is a slashable offense to sign two different Headers for the same proposing slot.</strong></p><p>The Builder can now broadcast these conflicting Signed Headers to the network and the Proposer may be slashed from the network.</p><h2>What is stopping Builders from censoring transactions?</h2><p>Well, nothing. The most common reason why Builders might censor a transaction is because it interacts with . <em>To simplify, OFAC addresses interacting transactions that may have legal repercussions, which quite obviously nobody would want on their heads.</em></p><p>\\\nAccording to <a href=\"https://censorship.pics/\">Censorship.pics</a> blocks built by Builders only include 0-7% OFAC sanctioned transactions.</p><p>One of the most well-known solutions to transaction censoring as of writing this are .</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547\">Inclusions Lists</a> are a list of transactions(along with something called Summary) that are posted by the Proposer of the Slot N along with proposing the Block of Slot N.</p><p>\\\nInclusion Lists enforce that the transactions in the list must be included either in Block N or Block N+1, otherwise the N+1 block will be invalid. These are called </p><p>:::info\n: There is also a notion for  which does IL for the current Block N itself. But this design had economic flaws leading to </p><p>\\\nOf course, this design of ILs will not enable 100% Censorship Resistance, but there is active research ongoing to harden these proposals and many neat optimizations that can be applied to better the incentive structure.</p><p>\\\nFOCIL allows multiple Validators to provide suggestions on the Inclusion List for a specific slot. To be more precise, 16 Validators are chosen randomly at each slot to form an Inclusion List Committee. These members each form their own local IL and gossip it around to the network. The Proposer collects and aggregates available local inclusion lists into a final IL. The IL designs are lightweight since there is no need to rebuild the block to include these transactions; they can just be appended to the block. The condition for a Block to satisfy the IL validation requirement is <strong>“<em>Block is valid if it contains all the transactions from all the ILs until the block is full.”</em></strong></p><p>:::info\n: The IL committee members cannot guarantee any form of transaction ordering as the IL transactions can be included in any order. They only guarantee transaction inclusion.</p><ul><li><strong>Decentralization of MEV Extraction</strong>: Block builders, rather than a few large validators, handle MEV extraction, reducing validator centralization risks. However, this is a double edged sword since in the process of mitigating Validator centralization, we have introduced Builder Centralization where only a few Builders are building a large percentage of Blocks.</li><li><strong>Fairer Revenue Distribution</strong>: Validators still profit from MEV without directly engaging in extraction, making block production fairer.</li><li><strong>More Efficient Block Space Utilization</strong>: Competition among builders leads to optimized blocks with better gas efficiency.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Centralization Risk Among Builders</strong>: While validators are decentralized, a few dominant builders could still centralize MEV extraction.</li><li><strong>Trust in Off-Chain MEV Relays</strong>: PBS currently relies on MEV-Boost relays, which operate off-chain, posing potential security risks as a point of failure.</li></ul>","contentLength":14688,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Apple is bringing lossless audio and low-latency audio to AirPods Max","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/apple-is-bringing-lossless-audio-and-low-latency-audio-to-airpods-max/","date":1742826547,"author":"Aisha Malik","guid":12833,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Apple announced on Monday that it’s bringing lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio to AirPods Max headphones when using the included USB-C cable.

It’s a compilation of comments I’ve made on various platforms across the web. I’ve tried to make some sense of an inherently fragmented discussion. Hope this helps ease your concerns about all the AI hype.</em></p><p>I don’t know how to cook, at least not at the level of people who claim they can. But I do have plenty of experience with \"Vibe Cooking.\" I could probably teach a class on it. I know how to fry an egg and make instant noodles; I know you need to add a bit of water when reheating rice and that butter is better than oil or margarine when frying an egg. Nothing more sophisticated to report.</p><p>\\\nI know how to boil water, throw in some noodles (without the seasoning packet because it’s pure sodium), add some tomato sauce, and mix in whatever leftovers I have from the previous day. I season it with salt, oregano, and parsley if I have any, plus some pepper. If there’s ground beef, great. If not, a hot dog or boiled egg will do—I handle that in a parallel task. If I’m feeling extra creative, I throw in some beans and crispy potato sticks. The result is the famous \"stone soup\" dish.</p><p>\\\nIt’s funny to watch, maybe even TikTok-worthy, but I won’t be opening a restaurant or making money off it—unless, of course, I had thousands of followers. Since I’m a nobody in the grand scheme of things, I just make it for myself. And it gets the job done because I don’t enjoy cooking and have no desire to learn.</p><p>\\\nInfluencers might strike gold here. Plenty of them are blowing up on Instagram and TikTok doing worse. It’s probably just a bandwagon effect—I don’t see it as a sustainable business. But it’s fascinating to watch.</p><p>\\\nX/@levesio recently shared his goal of making $1 million ARR with his fly-game, built entirely through vibe coding. A pretty profitable stone soup. I’m keeping a close eye on it to figure all this out.</p><h2>Vibe Cooking (Coding) Isn't a Threat</h2><p>No top chef has ever lost sleep over the rise of kitchen gadgets or the industrialization of instant noodles. Plenty of regular folks are making vibe-cooking meals at home with ramen and pasta. The upside: They don’t have to spend money eating out. And yet, restaurants are still packed, and food trucks still line the streets next to hot dog stands.</p><p>\\\nI compare AI assistants to kitchen appliances like microwaves, using the same perspective as Chef Gordon Ramsay: they’re incredibly useful, but if you rely on them for everything, your food will turn out awful. Just knowing how to use a microwave or an air fryer doesn’t make you a chef. Top chefs still own professional knife sets because so much of their work is hands-on and artisanal. That won’t change anytime soon. The same goes for programming—especially when it comes to game development, which is almost an art form.</p><p>\\\nVibe coding has brought a lot of curious newcomers into the tech field—the so-called citizen developers—and that’s great. Encouraging people to learn programming and creating job opportunities benefits any country. I see huge potential in improving tools for vibe coding. Maybe soon, we’ll get better approaches to handling the non-deterministic nature of LLMs.</p><p>\\\nBut I don’t think many of them will stick around. At first, it’s fun—until the AI stops \"vibing,\" and you actually have to roll up your sleeves and dive into the code. Coding can be tedious for some; it requires methodical thinking. I’ve already seen posts from people who built a <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/327-stories-to-learn-about-saas\">SaaS</a> and lost patience fixing bugs. Now they just want to sell it and move on.</p><p>\\\nThat’s why I’m not convinced that vibe coding is a sustainable business model for citizen developers. Coding is just one piece of the puzzle—most people don’t understand how we can sit for eight hours staring at a screen, “chewing” through code. Computer science has evolved massively over the last few decades; there’s a lot to learn, and the technical jargon alone is intimidating. But I could be wrong. As I said, I’m watching this space closely because it’s fascinating.</p><p>Back in the ’90s, CASE tools and code generators stirred up the same kind of panic. Marketers swore programming jobs would disappear. They sold well at first, mostly due to psychological pressure rather than real utility. But soon, people got fed up with \"programming\" because they weren’t cut out for it—or didn’t want to learn something new. And when maintenance time came around, no one wanted to sit down and fix the spaghetti code these tools generated. They dumped it on analysts and developers, who usually decided it was better to scrap everything and start over.</p><p>\\\nNow, I see many developers genuinely worried about losing their jobs or struggling to stay in the industry. The rise of vibe coding is making it worse, fueled by AI hype. Big tech and startups are promoting this sensationalism, but programmers aren’t their real target—investors are. That’s why there are so many sketchy AI demos (see: the infamous Devin). It doesn’t matter if it “still” doesn’t work 100%. As long as it wows people, it’s got potential. That’s why billions are being poured into AI—because of its potential.</p><p>\\\nThis fear-mongering around junior devs doesn’t make sense. Companies are slashing salaries, cutting hiring, and spreading fear that AI will take over junior roles—all to keep the AI hype going and inflate stock prices. They’re discouraging the next generation. Eventually, it’ll end up like the COBOL market—where the experienced devs are aging out, and no new talent wants in.</p><p>\\\nIn my opinion, this entropy is temporary. Things feel chaotic due to the hype, but it will stabilize. AI won’t replace programmers—it’ll push companies to invest more in software development due to the efficiency AI brings. That means more job openings, especially for juniors. But patience is key while this “circus” winds down.</p><p>We’re witnessing another shift in computer programming. We’ll keep coding, but the \"modus operandi\" will change—just like it did when we moved on from punch cards and floppy disks or when Flash was replaced by HTML5 and modern frontend frameworks. The '90s and early 2000s brought a wave of new programming languages, and I believe we’ll see more in the coming years.</p><p>\\\nRecently, AI has introduced a fresh batch of IDEs and tools, just like the early 2000s gave us Eclipse, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, and VS Code. In tech, people don’t cling to the past. (Almost) everyone adapts quickly—it’s part of the job.</p><p>\\\nThere’ll probably be even bigger impacts. AI chatting sites are affecting platforms like Stack Overflow and CodeProject, which now face the risk of extinction, just like Google impacted other search engines. Social media is increasingly full of AI-powered bots, YouTube now has AI-made videos, and Spotify is loaded with artificially generated music.</p><p>\\\nThe work AI does in coding is still mostly autocomplete, based on what it’s scraped from the web. The other day, I asked ChatGPT to generate a lexer and parser in Python for JavaScript. It spat out a program using the  library—code that was straight from a GitHub repo. It just copied and pasted someone’s work…</p><p>\\\nBut these are fascinating times, living through this evolution with these tools at our fingertips. Using the ChatGPT app to practice English fluency is surreal—20 years ago, that’d be sci-fi. And sometimes GitHub Copilot suggests code that blows my mind, like it’s reading my thoughts. That lexer/parser I mentioned? I asked ChatGPT to explain parts of the code, and it did it perfectly, like I was chatting with the repo’s author.</p><h2>A New Evolution in Programming</h2><p>If you, reader, are Gen Z, you don’t have any memory of life without cell phones. I’m Gen X—I lived decades before using a mobile phone and remember what life was like with payphones on the street and a landline at home. I closely followed the impact of smartphones after 2008. It changed the world, made things a lot better, and it’ll get even better with AI.</p><p>\\\nAI assistants in programming are the same deal: there’s no going back—use it or become obsolete; adopt it or turn into a hermit living in the mountains. It won’t replace a developer, but we’ll use it throughout whatever we’re programming. If you work on the Linux kernel, you’ll use it sparingly. If you’re at some corporation, you’ll use it for everything.</p><p>\\\nJava programmers haven’t written constructor methods or getters and setters by hand in ages. It’s all auto-generated (thank you, Lombok!), and no one’s ever cared. An AI assistant like MS Copilot will help a ton with generating code, but we’ll still have to debug, write a lot of code, fix bugs, and so on. Plus, you often need to tweak and thoroughly test whatever it suggests or generates.</p><p>\\\nIf you don’t memorize phone numbers, you rely on your phone for that. You’ll become dependent on AI in programming the same way you depend on internet access, running water, gas, and electricity. You rely on banks, credit cards, and supermarkets, and soon you’ll rely on a personalized AI agent. Life goes on…</p><p>\\\nThere are still tons of opportunities to explore in IT, and there’ll be even more demand now that AI is “raising the bar.” We’ll see new programming platforms, new phones and computers (quantum chips!), and new professionals in demand, especially in development. Don’t worry about imposter syndrome—just focus on staying updated and knowing enough to critique and fix AI-generated code. Focus on your work, study what interests you, and don’t compare yourself to anyone.</p>","contentLength":9664,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DNA-Testing Firm 23andMe Files for Bankruptcy","url":"https://slashdot.org/story/25/03/24/0517231/dna-testing-firm-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742824800,"author":"msmash","guid":12801,"unread":true,"content":"DNA-testing company 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection [non-paywalled source] in Missouri and announced CEO Anne Wojcicki's immediate resignation, weeks after rejecting her proposal to buy back the business she co-founded.

In his introductory scene in the movie, we see him murder two innocent attendants, simply because he wants to test his new blades.</p><p>\\\nUpon arriving at Arrakis,&nbsp;&nbsp;instantly challenges his brother, threatening to kill him, and injuring him in the process. By placing Rabban in his place,&nbsp;&nbsp;endears himself to the audience, with the ‘’ being one of the most hated characters.</p><p>“<em>Old fashion Artillery, genius</em>”…&nbsp;&nbsp;receives high praise from the Baron for his tactics in ‘liberating the north’ and restoring spruce production. By abandoning traditional war tactics, he forces the Fremen to flee the north and head south, something&nbsp;&nbsp;has failed to achieve. Even the&nbsp;&nbsp;himself has to join the rest of the Fremen in exile and embrace his visions before he can face&nbsp;.</p><p>\\\nIn his fight with&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Arena on Geidi Prime, we see further evidence of&nbsp;’s tactics. He lulls his opponent into a false sense of security, teasing victory, before killing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;is also able to deduce the movement of the Fremen without any outside information, further demonstrating his tactical knowledge.</p><p>“<em>May thy knife chip and shatter</em>”….&nbsp;&nbsp;famously echoes the Fremen's battle cry back to&nbsp;&nbsp;before their epic showdown. From the moment we are introduced to&nbsp;, it is clear he is a proper warrior and a deadly one too. We first witness his skills in the arena when he faces&nbsp;&nbsp;and then again when he dispatches his brother with ease. While his fight scenes in the movie are limited, it's clear he is one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Emperor himself selects&nbsp;&nbsp;as his champion and he pushes Paul to the brink, stabbing him twice before ultimately losing.</p><p>“<em>I’m Here Atreides, I need a blade</em>”…&nbsp;&nbsp;responds to&nbsp;’s challenge to the Emperor and steps up to a trial by combat for the fate of the universe. He also proves defiant even when addressing the Baron, threatening to drown him whilst in the presence of guards. One thing everyone can agree on is that&nbsp;&nbsp;is one of the bravest characters in the movie, which earns him the adoration of the audience.</p><p>\\\nAfter the liberation of the North, he volunteers to go on the ground to face any Fremen resistance, against the advice of his officers.

Based on Keymakr’s experience, implementing a consensus approach with multiple experts in specific cases can reduce annotation errors by 30–50%. Consensus minimizes mistakes, automates quality control, and helps create benchmark datasets — especially critical in high-responsibility areas such as medicine and autonomous driving.</p><p>\\\nTatiana Verbitskaya, a technical solution architect at <a href=\"https://keymakr.com/?utm_source=HackerNoon&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=Consensus\">Keymakr</a>, talks about how this method works and the projects in which it has been successfully applied.</p><p>Consensus is achieved by gathering the opinions of multiple experts. When defining “ground truth” data, it is vital to establish an agreed-upon standard of accuracy. Consensus is critical when training a model on subjective data, such as color and shape, or when high accuracy is required. This method is actively used in the early stages when the model has not yet been trained on sufficient data or when additional training is needed, particularly for specific cases (e.g., subjective judgments). Additionally, consensus is critical in large-scale projects, such as annotating data for self-driving cars or monitoring transportation, as it enhances precision while reducing errors.</p><h2><strong>Key Principles of Consensus:</strong></h2><ul><li>Odd Number of Experts: To avoid deadlocks, consensus relies on an odd number of annotators, ensuring a definitive outcome even in cases of disagreement.</li><li>Disagreement Analysis: This method doesn’t just rely on the majority vote but also considers the frequency of disagreements. If discrepancies are too significant, the data may be flagged for additional review or not even used for the model training.</li><li>Error Detection Mechanisms: Even consensus-based data can contain errors if the cases are too subjective and not definitive.</li></ul><p>\\\nGlobal technology leaders like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta actively use consensus-based annotation to improve AI model performance. Google Health, for instance, applies multiple radiologist annotations to X-rays to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Tesla uses consensus to label data from autopilot cameras, reducing training errors in autonomous driving. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth incorporates consensus annotation in NLP, computer vision, and satellite imagery analysis, while Meta employs it for facial and object recognition projects.</p><h2><strong>Medical Consensus: An Annotation Council</strong></h2><p>One of the most critical applications of consensus is in medical image annotation for disease diagnosis. Experts say radiologists’ diagnoses can vary by as much as 20–30%, directly impacting patient outcomes. When a consensus-based approach is employed — where multiple radiologists independently annotate images and their inputs are aggregated based on expertise-weighted scoring — annotation accuracy can be improved by up to 40%.</p><p>\\\nKeymakr actively applies this approach in complex medical projects. As a result, this helps to ensure precise image labeling for AI models trained to detect complex pathologies. Here, the process was built using the <a href=\"https://keylabs.ai/?utm_source=HackerNoon&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=Consensus\">Keylabs</a> platform — where you can compare the opinions of several experts, identify discrepancies, and form high-precision datasets. This approach significantly increases the reliability of algorithms used in automated diagnostics, minimizing the risk of wrong diagnosis.</p><h2><strong>Consensus in Copyright Content Usage Monitoring</strong></h2><p>Currently, <a href=\"https://keymakr.com/?utm_source=HackerNoon&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=Consensus\">Keymakr</a> collaborates with [SoundAware](), a company that deploys automated music recognition technology to identify copyrighted music usage. The team reviews 10,000 URLs to assess the presence of copyrighted material.</p><p>\\\nVideo platforms are filled with content that can contain the author’s material, such as music, scenes from movies, or TV show fragments. Due to the vast amount of data and the subjective nature of copyright interpretation, manually analyzing each video is impractical.</p><p>However, Keymakr identifies cases where copyrighted content is used or modified in ways automated systems cannot detect reliably yet. These include parodies, fan art, and homages.</p><p>\\\nTo eliminate subjectivity, Keymakr employs a consensus-based approach: each video is evaluated by multiple independent experts who answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>Does the video contain copyrighted music?</li><li>Does it feature scenes from a movie or TV show?</li><li>Has the content been modified, such as through editing or remixing?</li></ul><p>Based on the experts' responses, a final decision is made regarding potential copyright issues.</p><p>Such projects are essential for enforcing copyright and ensuring rights holders receive fair compensation. Additionally, this process helps companies specializing in content monitoring refine their algorithms and accelerate the detection of copyrighted material.</p><h2><strong>Consensus in Vehicle and Pedestrian Tracking</strong></h2><p>Consensus is also widely applied in AI training for autonomous vehicles, particularly in object recognition on roads (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs). For instance, a camera might capture a pedestrian in motion, and human annotators might disagree on whether the object is a person or a shadow. Consensus ensures precise labeling in such scenarios.</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://keymakr.com/?utm_source=HackerNoon&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=Consensus\">Keymakr</a> team recently worked with analysis of video recorded on cameras to track vehicles. It was necessary to track the vehicle's movement through several cameras at a crossroads and ensure that the system correctly identified the same vehicle in different frames.</p><p>The cameras recorded one object (car) at several points. Several experts viewed the video from different cameras. They assessed whether this object is the same car because there could be differences in perception of appearance (for example, by color or brand). The information was used to train the model if five annotators confirmed the object’s identity. Otherwise, such data would have been excluded from the dataset. This has reduced the number of false alarms and increased the accuracy of car recognition systems, which is important for urban safety systems and automatic traffic control systems.</p><p>\\\nThe same approach can be applied to identify people in shopping malls or on the streets. Cameras capture movement by analyzing, for example, the color of clothes, height, or other characteristics. This method is used to:</p><ul><li>Enhanced security monitoring</li><li>Retail visitor behavior analysis</li><li>Crowd flow assessment in public areas</li></ul><h2><strong>The Future of Consensus in AI</strong></h2><p>The future of consensus-based data annotation is promising, particularly as AI models become more complex and data volume grows. The global Data Annotation and Labeling Market <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/data-annotation-and-labelling-market-20349022.html\">is projected</a> to reach $3.6 billion by 2027, and many companies are adopting multi-layered annotation verification to enhance data quality. Studies show that models trained on datasets with consensus annotation demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than models trained on single-source labeling.</p><p>\\\nDespite the development of automatic annotation and generative AI, the human factor remains key: subjectivity and annotation disagreements necessitate multi-stage validation. Therefore, the consensus method will continue to be used, ensuring data reliability and reducing errors in critical areas such as autonomous systems, medicine, and financial analysis.</p>","contentLength":7253,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What If AI Grew Up in a Neighborhood, Not a Castle?","url":"https://hackernoon.com/what-if-ai-grew-up-in-a-neighborhood-not-a-castle?source=rss","date":1742819006,"author":"Anna Naumova","guid":13333,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Imagine all of the smartest robots and algorithms we call AI living in one big castle.</p><p>\\\nIt’s huge. Strong. Enclosed behind high walls and guards. You need to request permission to enter. Few have the keys to them. And inside, they make the big calls — what data gets used, how the A.I. learns and who it helps.</p><p>\\\nNow imagine the exact opposite.</p><p>\\\nIt’s not one big castle; it’s a neighborhood. The little brain: A piece of the AI home puzzle in every house. These little brains can communicate with each other, learn together and assist their owners. No walls. No gates. Each one gives a bit, and the entire community gets smart.</p><p>\\\nThat is the difference between  AI and  AI.</p><p>\\\nAnd it’s not just a nice little story. A big deal for the future of AI and how it will work. Especially in terms of privacy, security, and trust.</p><p>\\\nWe’re going to walk you through this — like we’re 5 years old.</p><h2>The Castle on the Hill of Centralized AI 🏰</h2><p>The AI that exists today is mostly in giant data centers, the kind owned by the largest of companies. The data (photos, emails, voice recordings, medical files, etc.) is sent there to be processed by banks of super-powerful computers that train AI models.</p><p>\\\nThese companies decide:</p><ul><li><p>What it does with that knowledge</p></li></ul><p>That’s centralized AI. It’s neat and efficient. It can be very fast. But it has problems, too.</p><p>\\\nWhat happens if someone creeps into the castle? They could steal everything.</p><p>\\\nOr what if the owners of the castle don’t play nice? They might:</p><ul><li>Block people they don’t like</li><li>Internally or externally control what the AI says or does</li></ul><h2>Decentralized AI: A More Friendly, Smarter Neighborhood 🏘️</h2><p>By far the biggest difference, however, is that the power is decentralized.</p><p>\\\nNot one castle, but a neighborhood. So lots of small computers (like yours and mine) carry the AI around and run it. No single boss. No one place to break into.</p><p>\\\nIndividuals retain ownership of their data. You still can teach the A.I. new tricks, but you don’t have to sacrifice your entire existence to do so.</p><p>\\\nThe smart part? And these tiny AIs communicate with one another. They share safe information. They learn as a team.</p><p>\\\nAnd when one part breaks? The others keep going.</p><p>\\\nThat’s how decentralization preserves privacy, prevents control by a small number of companies and creates a voice for everyone.</p><h2>All Right, But How Exactly Does That Work? 🧠</h2><p>That’s where some neat tools like  are useful.</p><p>\\\nYou can think of Aleph Cloud as the road that ties together all the houses in our AI neighborhood.</p><p>\\\nIt does two important things:</p><p>Rather than housing your files in a single data center, Aleph spreads small fragments of your files around — across, effectively, many places. It’s kind of like writing in your diary and allowing each friend a page to hold onto.</p><p>Computers are what AI needs to think and learn. Aleph allows you to run those jobs of thinking on a heap of little computers, not only on big machines. This utility is known as decentralized compute.</p><p>\\\nYou don’t have to create a system from scratch. Aleph allows you to build faster, safer decentralized AI apps that do not live in a castle.</p><h2>Why This Assists With Privacy Protection 🔐</h2><p>Let’s say your smartwatch is measuring your heart rate.</p><p>\\\nIn , that data goes directly to the castle. They retain it, analyze it and perhaps even deploy it to serve you advertisements. Sometimes it is shared or leaked.</p><p>\\\nWith , your data belongs to you. Your watch could pick up on your habits, figure out when you were about to have problems and alert you without sending every action to a big company.</p><p>\\\nYou have intelligent functionality without losing your authority.</p><p>\\\nThat’s a significant victory for .</p><h2>What About Transparency? 👀</h2><p>So one reason people don’t trust AI is that it’s often a black box. You feed it data, and it churns out answers — but you don’t know how or why.</p><p>\\\nIn a castle, that mystery is even larger. Very few know what’s going on behind the walls.</p><p>\\\nBased on the blockchain, everything can be more transparent due to decentralized AI. You can:</p><ul><li>See how the AI was trained</li><li>Know where your data is going</li><li>Document what decisions were made, and why</li></ul><p>\\\nThis honesty fosters .</p><p>\\\nIt’s like saying everyone can read the castle rulebook, rather than keeping it hidden in the king’s pocket.</p><h2>Real-World Use Cases: The Light of Neighborhood AI 🔥</h2><p> is more than just a concept. It’s already operating in places such as:</p><ol><li><p> AI can help doctors diagnose disease — without needing to send every patient file to the cloud. Hospitals retain control of sensitive data but can still analyze patterns that span the network.</p></li><li><p> Cars can exchange what they know about traffic and roadblocks, about other cars and about the weather — without transmitting video of every passenger to a data center.</p></li><li><p> You could use AI to detect fraud — or dispense financial advice — without putting your personal bank account information at risk.</p></li><li><p> Smart sensors on farms can track soil and weather, which allows AIs to be trained locally so that farmers don’t need fast internet or massive access to the cloud.</p></li></ol><p>These are all cases where  is important, and where  helps individuals remain in control.</p><h2>Okay, So What’s the Catch? 🧩</h2><p> isn’t without its faults, just like real neighborhoods. It can be:</p><ul><li>Slower than centralized systems</li><li>More people involved = more difficult to organize</li><li>Harder to update or patch because the code is distributed</li></ul><p>\\\nIt also demands new types of thought.

With social engineering tactics becoming increasingly sophisticated, it's important to stay ahead of potential threats. This article outlines some of the most advanced and deceptive scams, particularly those targeting job seekers in Web3, and provides actionable steps to protect yourself.</p><h2><strong>1. Job Offer Scams and Fake Recruiters</strong></h2><p>Scammers impersonate recruiters or employees of well-known Web3 companies. They approach blockchain developers on LinkedIn or Telegram with flattering messages and high-paying job offers.</p><p>\\\nThe victim is invited to an \"interview,\" but the scammers claim they use a <em>\"secure, in-house video conferencing tool\"</em> instead of Zoom or Google Meet.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Once the victim installs the software and joins the interview, their system is compromised, leading to the theft of wallet funds.</strong> The attack works by detecting and sweeping funds from hot wallets like MetaMask or Phantom.</p><ul><li>Never install software from an unknown source, even if it appears to come from a reputable company. \\n </li><li>Verify recruiters by checking mutual connections, their work history, and whether they have genuine endorsements. \\n </li><li>Use a separate, clean device for work-related communications, especially if you're dealing with crypto assets. \\n </li><li>Keep your development machine air-gapped from any wallets holding significant funds.</li></ul><h2><strong>2. Fake GitHub Repositories and UI Scams</strong></h2><p>A scammer contacts you with a request to audit or test a GitHub repository. They send a , claiming it's a work-related test or a proof of concept. Sounds legit, and many will not notice anything suspicious. And that would be a fatal mistake.</p><p>\\\nThe repository <strong>contains malicious code designed to extract private keys</strong>, inject malware, or execute wallet-draining scripts.</p><p>\\\nThe victim runs the provided script or opens a compromised user interface (UI) that requests private key access.</p><ul><li>Always inspect repositories thoroughly before running any code, especially scripts requiring execution privileges. \\n </li><li>Use a sandboxed virtual machine or an isolated environment (e.g., Tails OS) when testing unverified code. \\n </li><li>Check commit history and contributors — if a repo has no meaningful history or appears AI-generated, it's a red flag. \\n </li><li>Never enter your private key or seed phrase into any website or application outside of a trusted wallet provider.</li></ul><h2><strong>3. Overpaid Job Offers with Unrealistic Salaries</strong></h2><p>Scammers offer extremely high salaries (e.g., $150+ per hour or $250K+ yearly) for simple blockchain-related work. Bu there is a “small nuance”. They ask for personal information, including GitHub, CV, and even <em>direct access to test repositories</em>.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Eventually, they request that you install their software, test a smart contract, or deploy a script — one that compromises your system.</strong></p><ul><li>Be skeptical of job offers with excessive salaries that seem too good to be true. \\n </li><li>Validate companies by researching them on official sites, checking real employees, and cross-referencing with known Web3 security experts. \\n </li><li>Avoid sending personal data or connecting wallets to unknown platforms before verifying legitimacy.</li></ul><h2><strong>4. Fake Zoom, Google Meet, and Chat Applications</strong></h2><p>Scammers claim that for \"security reasons,\" they use a proprietary meeting tool instead of known platforms. They send a <em>link that looks like Zoom, Google Meet, or Telegram</em> but is actually a phishing site.</p><p>\\\nWhen opened, <strong>the malicious site installs a script that either extracts browser-stored private keys or deploys clipboard hijackers.</strong></p><ul><li>Always check URLs carefully — phishing domains often contain small typos or extra characters. \\n </li><li>Use browser security extensions that detect fake domains. \\n </li><li>Run crypto-related communications in a separate, hardened browser profile (e.g., Brave with strict security settings). \\n </li><li>Never download standalone meeting software unless it’s from a verified, official source.</li></ul><h2><strong>5. Social Engineering and Psychological Manipulation</strong></h2><p>Attackers build <em>\"legit-looking\" LinkedIn profiles</em> with fake endorsements and AI-generated backgrounds. They engage in friendly, long-term social engineering before making their move.</p><p>\\\nIf a victim refuses one scam, they may attempt a different angle — <strong>fake token sales, job offers, or investment opportunities.</strong></p><ul><li>Cross-check profiles using multiple sources. If someone’s work history lacks depth, it's likely fake. \\n </li><li>Be cautious of unsolicited offers and overly eager recruiters. \\n </li><li>Never let social pressure rush you into downloading files or clicking on unknown links.</li></ul><h2><strong>Final Thoughts: Stay Vigilant, Stay Secure</strong></h2><p>As blockchain developers and founders, you're a prime target for scammers due to the nature of your work and access to valuable assets. Implementing strict security measures — such as hardware wallets, separate work environments, and in-depth verification processes — will drastically reduce your risk of falling victim to these scams.</p><ul><li>Always verify recruiters and job offers before engaging.</li><li>Use sandboxed environments for testing third-party code.</li><li>Never install unknown meeting software or click suspicious links.</li><li>Keep personal and professional crypto wallets separate.</li><li>Treat unsolicited, high-paying offers with extreme skepticism.</li></ul><p>\\\n<em>If you come across new scams or need further insights, share your experiences — awareness is our best defense.</em></p>","contentLength":5320,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This Free Visual Editor Let's You Edit Your Web App's Content Without Digging Into the Code","url":"https://hackernoon.com/this-free-visual-editor-lets-you-edit-your-web-apps-content-without-digging-into-the-code?source=rss","date":1742817531,"author":"Aymeric PINEAU","guid":13331,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Do you have content on your website?

Most of that ends up in the Wayback Machine, while the rest is digitized analog media — books, television, radio, academic papers — scanned and stored on servers. As one of the few large-scale archivists to back up the web, the Internet Archive finds itself in a particularly unique position right now... Thousands of [U.S. government] datasets were wiped — mostly at agencies focused on science and the environment — in the days following Trump's return to the White House... \nThe Internet Archive is among the few efforts that exist to catch the stuff that falls through the digital cracks, while also making that information accessible to the public. Six weeks into the new administration, Wayback Machine director [Mark] Graham said, the Internet Archive had cataloged some 73,000 web pages that had existed on U.S. government websites that were expunged after Trump's inauguration... \n\nAccording to Graham, based on the big jump in page views he's observed over the past two months, the Internet Archive is drawing many more visitors than usual to its services — journalists, researchers and other inquiring minds. Some want to consult the archive for information lost or changed in the purge, while others aim to contribute to the archival process.... \"People are coming and rallying behind us,\" said Brewster Kahle, [the founder and current director of the Internet Archive], \"by using it, by pointing at things, helping organize things, by submitting content to be archived — data sets that are under threat or have been taken down....\" \n\nA behemoth of link rot repair, the Internet Archive rescues a daily average of 10,000 dead links that appear on Wikipedia pages. In total, it's fixed more than 23 million rotten links on Wikipedia alone, according to the organization. \n\nThough it receives some money for its preservation work for libraries, museums, and other organizations, it's also funded by donations. \"From the beginning, it was important for the Internet Archive to be a nonprofit, because it was working for the people,\" explains founder Brewster Kahle on its donations page:\n\nIts motives had to be transparent; it had to last a long time. That's why we don't charge for access, sell user data, or run ads, even while we offer free resources to citizens everywhere. We rely on the generosity of individuals like you to pay for servers, staff, and preservation projects. If you can't imagine a future without the Internet Archive, please consider supporting our work. We promise to put your donation to good use as we continue to store over 99 petabytes of data, including 625 billion webpages, 38 million texts, and 14 million audio recordings. \n\nTwo interesting statistics from NPR's article:\n\n\"A Pew Research Center study published last year found that roughly 38% of web pages on the internet that existed in 2013 were no longer accessible as of 2023.\"\n\"According to a Harvard Law Review study published in 2014, about half of all links cited in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer led to the original source material.\"\n\n\n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader jtotheh for sharing the news.","contentLength":3546,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"No, the Market Isn’t ‘Hunting’ Your Stop-Loss—Here’s What’s Really Happening Instead","url":"https://hackernoon.com/no-the-market-isnt-hunting-your-stop-lossheres-whats-really-happening-instead?source=rss","date":1742815798,"author":"Adam Bakay","guid":13329,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Regarding trading buzzwords, the word “liquidity” is very popular to throw around.</p><p>\\\nMost price action trading strategies nowadays put high emphasis on concepts of liquidity and constant attempts of markets “hunting stops” of retail traders in order to initiate larger moves.</p><p>\\\nIs this really the case? Is there really someone sitting behind the curtain hunting your stop-loss and can you gain a trading edge from using different tools that display “liquidity” in markets?</p><p>\\\nThis is what we are going to find out in this article where I cover everything you need to know about liquidity and how to implement some of the popular concepts in your trading.</p><p>Although you very often hear liquidity described as “stop losses of other traders” this is actually not a very accurate description of what liquidity actually is.</p><p>\\\nI will talk about stops later on, but at its core, liquidity simply represents resting limit orders in any given market.</p><p>The picture above shows available liquidity for BTCUSDT on Binance.</p><p>\\\nFor simplicity and better understanding, I increased grouping to $50 for each price point.</p><p>\\\nAs you can see from the image there are 70.827BTC willing to buy at 28900 and 16.608 BTC willing to sell at 28950.</p><p>\\\nYou can think about these levels as floors and ceilings below and above price as markets won’t be able to advance higher or lower by $50 as long as someone is going to either buy into those 16.608 BTC at the offer or sell into those 70.827 BTC at the bid.</p><p>\\\nIn the order book (often also called ladder, or depth of market (DOM)), you can only see limit orders.</p><p>\\\nIn other words, if I want to enter the new position and place a limit order in the order book, or if I want to exit the existing position via a limit order for profit.</p><p>\\\nWhat you cannot see are stop orders (stop-losses) or liquidation prices as these are executed via market orders as default on all exchanges.</p><p>\\\nLooking at the order books and heatmaps is a popular way for a lot of traders as they try to see if there is a large supply or demand coming to the market.</p><p>\\\nWhat a lot of traders do is look at significant orders resting under or above price and think about them as “whales” creating support or resistance.</p><p>\\\nThis can be very tricky in practice as you should ask yourself a question why someone with a large size would want to let everyone know their intention.</p><p>\\\nMany times these large outstanding orders are spoof orders, which are meant to create a false narrative about supply/demand coming into markets just to be pulled when price reach close proximity of the orders.</p><p>\\\nWhat often ends up happening is that those who put the large orders in the market in the first place, were filling the opposite side of the trade as a lot of smaller traders were providing liquidity in an attempt to front-run the large order.</p><p>\\\nAlthough sometimes large order is genuine, large orders are very often executed OTC, or just spread into smaller limit orders across more prices.</p><p>\\\nYou might have experienced an iceberg order which is a large filled position out of nowhere that is caused by spreading a lot of small limit orders into near proximity by one entity.</p><p>\\\nSo is there any reason to pay attention to available liquidity in markets?</p><p>\\\nI would say yes, but it will highly differ based on the market you trade.</p><p>\\\nIf you trade forex and CFDs, these markets are traded over the counter and liquidity is gained from liquidity providers which are firms specializing in providing liquidity.</p><p>\\\nIn this case, there is no way for you to see the depth of the market and everything in regards to liquidity will be just pure speculation.</p><p>\\\nFor classic futures traded on CME or Eurex, you can see available liquidity for any exchange just by looking at DOM.</p><p>\\\nFutures markets are much less liquid and fast-paced than they used to be just a few years ago and it is harder and harder to gain an edge from watching DOM alone due to the large amount of HFT (high-frequency trading) firms participating in the markets.</p><p>\\\nThat being said I think looking at DOM can still provide you with some decent edge, but it will take a long time and a large amount of focus to develop.</p><p>\\\nCrypto is very interesting in this regard because of how much data and tools are available.</p><p>\\\nIt is still a very thin and fast-paced market so looking at DOM on single price points won’t give you much, same as trying to base your decision on outstanding orders as I previously mentioned they are often not genuine.</p><p>\\\nOne of the things I found interesting is looking at how order books are skewed to either the bid or offer side mostly on spot exchanges.</p><p>\\\nAlthough once again these pending orders are just the “advertisement” if the supply or demand comes from more participants at the same time, the chances of it being genuine increase.</p><p>\\\nBelow you can see BTCUSDT on Binance and how price action reacted when the order book got significantly skewed to one side.</p><h3>How does liquidity determine the volatility in different markets</h3><p>\\\nThe main thing that liquidity does is it determines how much is given market going to move.</p><p>\\\nWe can look at BTC and ETH or ES and NQ as an example.</p><p>\\\nThese markets are very highly correlated meaning that in most cases when one moves to the upside or downside, the second one is doing exactly the same.</p><p>\\\nThe only difference is the magnitude of how much they will move % wise.</p><p>The image above shows ES and NQ on a weekly timeframe.</p><p>\\\nAs you can see, after March 2020 covid crash, ES rallied 120% followed by a 27% correction.</p><p>\\\nAt the same time, NQ rallied 150% followed by a 37% correction.</p><p>\\\nThere is not a huge difference between ES and NQ from the fundamental point of view as they both track the US stock market, the main difference is the fact that ES is a much more liquid market.</p><p>\\\nIn other words, it takes a much bigger effort to move ES compared to NQ.</p><p>\\\nIt is then up to you if want to trade a thicker market that moves less (has lower volatility) or a thinner market that moves more (has higher volatility).</p><h2>Price action and liquidity pools</h2><p>You have likely heard about liquidity pools and different price action strategies that are focusing on hunting liquidity (stops).</p><p>\\\nThis is a little funny as I already mentioned the stop orders are not technically liquidity as these orders are not visible to anyone.</p><p>\\\nThis makes it in regards of price action more of a buzzword to make trading look more interesting and magical.</p><p>\\\nWith that being said, you have probably seen many times markets trade past certain swing points just to completely reverse.</p><p>The truth behind these moves is not hidden in some secret manipulation, but rather in core essence of the markets and the behavior of traders.</p><p>\\\nAll markets work in two-sided auctions, in other words for every buyer there has to be a seller and vice versa.</p><p>\\\nAlthough moves past certain swing points trigger some stop-losses as they tend to accumulate in the same areas, what you will often find is that these moves trigger just a larger amount of participation than usual from both mean-reverting and trend-following traders.</p><p>Markets very often tend to range rather than a trend, but retail traders tend to feel FOMO during the quick moves and very often try to participate in hopes of capturing large trends in price.</p><p>\\\nThis provides a great opportunity for large traders to fill their, in this case, shorts and trade the mean reversion side.</p><p>\\\nIf markets would be all about just “hunting stops” these moves would be often rather hectic as a large number of stops triggered at the same price points cause markets to slip several points at a time.</p><p>Just ask yourself if this move in Gold was just a quick stop hunt before going back down, why would the market spend over a day in the same area before selling off?</p><p>\\\nAlthough without a doubt some stops got triggered at the high, what came next was this two-sided auction between buyers and sellers that got resolved to the downside during the macroeconomic release.</p><p>\\\nAnother buzzword that goes along with liquidity is market makers.</p><p>\\\nThese are often described as evil entities chasing your stops.</p><p>\\\nI covered this topic in more detail previously on the <a href=\"https://tradingriot.com/smart-money-concepts-ict/#Market_Making\">blog</a>, so I will keep it short and simple here.</p><p>\\\nMarket making is delta neutral strategy that solely relies on providing liquidity to any given market.</p><p>Market makers quote both bid and offer at the same time and their main goal is to not have directional exposure to the market, they don’t make money by trying to capture where markets are going to go next, but by capturing the spread between bid and the ask.</p><p>\\\nBecause of that the sharp “stop-hunts” are actually the least favorable scenario for market makers as they often end up having the directional exposure in the underlying asset.</p><p>The image above shows the ideal scenario where market makers provide liquidity in lower volatility environments and make money on both sides of the market.</p><p>\\\nDoes this mean there is no manipulation in financial markets? Of course not.</p><p>\\\nEvery market whether if its forex, crypto, or futures has its fair share of manipulation and it is always done by different actors.</p><p>There are many cases of manipulation in Forex by large banks.</p><p>In crypto things get even worse and the overall market is much less liquid and therefore easier to manipulate there are many cases of firms creating a false demand for coins only to dump them on retail later on.</p><p>\\\nWith that being said, thinking that someone is hunting your 1 contract with your stop loss placed above a swing high on a 5-minute timeframe is more than silly.</p><h2>Liquidations and seeing stops</h2><p>In crypto, you can always see your liquidation price.</p><p>\\\nThis is a price point where the exchange will automatically close your position as you do not have enough margin to maintain the position opened.</p><p>\\\nLiquidation prices, same as stop losses, are not available to see in the order books.</p><p>\\\nThe only way for you to see liquidations or large amounts of stops getting hit is after the facts in these called liquidation cascades.</p><p>\\\nThese are characterized by sharp moves in price action and large decreases of open interest (positions getting forcefully closed) and in some software like <a href=\"https://coinalyze.net/\">Coinalyze</a> which you can see on the chart below, liquidations are also plotted as indicator (below the open interest).</p><p>Without naming any, there are some software in crypto that sell users access to liquidation heatmaps that basically plot levels of liquidations on your chart.</p><p>The indicator above shows “liquidation” levels and is made by Leviathan, it is completely free so you can test it out yourself.</p><p>\\\nIndicators and software like these only plot liquidation levels as estimates derived from changes in the open interest, and you can see on the chart that most of these levels tend to be at very logical places like above resistance or below the support.</p><p>\\\nIn my opinion, it is much smarter to watch how markets behave at these levels in regard to changes in open interest, order flow, and relative volume rather than trying to pre-emptively fade every single move because someone will get liquidated there.</p><p>If anything, after large spikes in price that cause bigger amounts of stops/liquidations getting triggered, markets tend to slow down and form accumulation/distribution rather than moving in straight lines up and down.</p><p>Throughout the years liquidity has been used as a huge buzzword in the trading community.</p><p>\\\nFor most people, it is largely misunderstood and often presented as a pure marketing trick to make you buy anything that will give you an “insider” look into financial markets.</p><p>\\\nIn many cases, it takes only common sense to find areas where other traders might be stopped out and even if you are not able to do that, you will very often have plenty of time to position yourself after the event by utilizing simple concepts of price action, volume, and orderflow.</p>","contentLength":11808,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Django Transactions & PostgreSQL Locks: Why Your Database is Slower Than You Think","url":"https://hackernoon.com/django-transactions-and-postgresql-locks-why-your-database-is-slower-than-you-think?source=rss","date":1742814942,"author":"Michael T.

This lets us minimize the amount of time transactions take, lower the DB’s latency (locks aren’t held for too long), and ensure other critical DB operations are not blocked. But how do DB operations block each other? Which ones are conflicting?</p><p>Locks exist because DBs can have multiple users executing commands simultaneously, e.g., one user performs a DROP TABLE command while another user reads from that table. This would cause an error or, worse, data corruption. To prevent this, every DB operation acquires and holds a lock specific to the permissions that the operation needs, e.g., DROP TABLE acquires an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock on the table being dropped because it requires exclusive access to drop that table safely. In contrast, SELECT acquires ACCESS SHARE lock, which allows it to read the table data but does not block other operations from reading or writing to that table. If neither operation can attain those locks on the table or another operation is holding a conflicting lock, the operation waits for the locks to be released.</p><p>\\\n<strong>There are two categories of PSQL locks — table and row.</strong></p><ul><li>Since table-level locks affect the entire table, they are the riskiest to hold since they block operations on the entire table. We want to minimize how long we hold table locks because the longer we hold a table lock the longer other connections will have to wait which can lead to timeouts and outages.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Row level locks affect a single row/record, these locks prevent operations on that particular record and are low risk but if we put a table migration in a transaction we can inadvertently hold all the locks on every row of that table thereby locking the entire table. With these locks, we want to minimize how many of them we hold. The more row locks we hold, the more records on the table are inaccessible.</p></li></ul><p>Here are the PSQL commands (operations) broken down by the severity of what they block.</p><ul><li><p>Everything (reads/writes)</p></li><li><p>Writes (inserting, updating, and deleting data)</p></li></ul><p>\\\nContinue reading for more details.</p><p>+++,++,** Check DB Operations That Block Table Access for the subcommand</p><h2>Background — Locks &amp; De-conflicting Concurrent Operations</h2><p>Locks exist to handle the problems that arise from concurrent connections. When we allow our databases to be operated (read/written) by multiple connections simultaneously, we run into conflicts. What if one connection tries to delete a row while another is querying? Or worse, what if one connection adds a new column to a table while another inserts a new row using the old schema? Locks prevent the errors and data corruption that can occur with simultaneous operations on the DB. The locks are held by the transactions initiated by the connection — every PSQL command is wrapped automatically in a transaction.</p><p>\\\nEach lock blocks operations that might cause an error or data corruption if executed simultaneously with the current operation. Some locks are very permissive and let almost all other operations occur simultaneously, e.g., the locks held by SELECT queries allow most other commands to be executed. These promiscuous locks can be held by multiple transactions at a time because these locks don’t conflict with each other (they don’t block each other’s operations). While other locks are exclusive and block multiple or all other operations, e.g., the locks held by certain ALTER TABLE/COLUMN sub-commands. These locks can only be held by one transaction at a time because they block all other operations and hence block themselves — we can’t execute two DROP TABLE commands on the same table simultaneously.</p><p>\\\nThe <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-locks.html\">pg_locks</a> table tracks all of this, along with which transaction is holding the locks. We can use this table to display outages and timeouts caused by lockouts and deadlocks.</p><h2>DB Operations that Block Table Access</h2><p>Every operation on the DB asks for and acquires a table lock before executing it. Most of these locks are loose and allow other operations — doing a SELECT query ( in Django) will allow all other operations except ALTER INDEX/TABLE (Django migrations that change a column or table).</p><p>\\\nThis table makes it obvious that migrations (changes to the schema) are the riskiest types of changes — CREATE INDEX and ALTER INDEX/TABLE are run in migrations.</p><pre><code>./manage.py sqlmigrate APP_NAME MIGRATION_NUM\n</code></pre><p>\\\nTo find out which operations a migration executes and if they are risky. If they are, make sure the migration is quick and run it after hours (when no other long-running transactions are running).</p><p>\\\nDROP TABLE is not included in this because it is obvious that it blocks all other commands (it acquires the same access exclusive lock as ALTER INDEX/TABLE). Paradoxically DROP TABLE wont cause your app to crash due to a lockout because it does not usually take a long time to execute — unless there are a many constraints on the table and references to the table.</p><ul><li>fk insert/update/delete will lock any referenced tables (following foreign keys on the table being operated on)</li><li>*create index concurrently</li><li>** create index (without concurrently)</li><li>only specific alter index/table subcommand:</li><li>alter table set statistics</li><li>alter table set (attribute)</li><li>alter table reset (attribute)</li><li>alter table add foreign key</li><li>alter table validate constraint</li><li>alter table set without cluster</li><li>alter table set (storage_parameter)*</li><li>alter table attach partition (on parent table)</li><li>alter table detach partition*</li><li>alter table add foreign key (on self and referenced table)</li><li>alter table disable/enable trigger”</li><li>+++ for all other subcommands of alter index/table</li><li>if there are two subcommands in one operation — the subcommand with the most stringent lock will be used</li></ul><p>Besides table locks, there are row or data locks that block write access to a specific row in a table. Unlike table locks, row locks don’t block reading data, so they are less risky, but they can cause the same damage a table lock does in specific scenarios.</p><p>\\\nSuppose we are migrating data in a table — going through all the rows in it and updating a deprecated constant or denormalizing a JSON object, for example. We will lock the entire table if this migration happens in a transaction, i.e., if we wrap the function that is doing that migration in an atomic() decorator or context. This is due to the operations on each record locking each row on the table and the transaction holding onto the row locks until the entire migration is finished. This will block writes to the table until every row is migrated.</p><p>\\\nA better solution is to NOT wrap the entire migration in a transaction block. If we need to alter multiple columns for each row, then wrap only the row operations in the migration. This way, after every row is changed, the lock is released.</p><h2>Django: Printing the SQL that Migrations Run</h2><pre><code>./manage.py sqlmigrate APP_NAME MIGRATION_NUMBER/NAME\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis will print the operations that will be run during the migration. A comment in the query will explain what each operation does.</p><p>\\\nFor a no-op migration — a migration that does not change the DB, like updates to TextChoice and similar columns — the result will look like this:</p><pre><code>BEGIN;\n - \n - Alter field transaction_status on transactions\n - \nCOMMIT;\n</code></pre><p>An empty transaction with a comment inside of it describing what the transaction represents.</p><p>\\\nThis migration does nothing—hence the SQL comments in the transaction block. The django_migrations table will be updated to track which migrations have been run, but that shouldn’t impact the app.</p><p>\\\nFor migrations that actually change the DB, the output will look like this:</p><pre><code>BEGIN;\n - \n - Add field reverted to transactions\n - \nALTER TABLE \"transactions\" ADD COLUMN \"reverted\" timestamp with time zone NULL;\nCOMMIT;\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis alters a table by adding a column that blocks all reads and writes.</p><ul><li>Great article, highly recommend reading this FIRST then the docs.</li><li>[PSQL Locks](https://Postgres Locks - A Deep&nbsp;Dive Great article, highly recommend reading this FIRST then the docs.)</li><li>Table Locks<ul><li>Two transactions cannot hold locks of conflicting modes on the same table at the same time. (However, a transaction never conflicts with itself. For example, it might acquire ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock and later acquire ACCESS SHARE lock on the same table.) Non-conflicting lock modes can be held concurrently by many transactions. Notice in particular that some lock modes are self-conflicting (for example, an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock cannot be held by more than one transaction at a time) while others are not self-conflicting (for example, an ACCESS SHARE lock can be held by multiple transactions).</li><li>Once acquired, a lock is normally held until the end of the transaction. But if a lock is acquired after establishing a savepoint, the lock is released immediately if the savepoint is rolled back to. This is consistent with the principle that ROLLBACK cancels all effects of the commands since the savepoint. The same holds for locks acquired within a PL/pgSQL exception block: an error escape from the block releases locks acquired within it.</li></ul></li><li>Row Locks<ul><li>Note that a transaction can hold conflicting locks on the same row, even in different subtransactions; but other than that, two transactions can never hold conflicting locks on the same row. Row-level locks do not affect data querying; they block only writers and lockers to the same row. Row-level locks are released at transaction end or during savepoint rollback, just like table-level locks.</li></ul></li><li>Deadlocks &amp; Transactions<ul><li>The use of explicit locking can increase the likelihood of deadlocks, wherein two (or more) transactions each hold locks that the other wants. For example, if transaction 1 acquires an exclusive lock on table A and then tries to acquire an exclusive lock on table B, while transaction 2 has already exclusive-locked table B and now wants an exclusive lock on table A, then neither one can proceed. PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlock situations and resolves them by aborting one of the transactions involved, allowing the other(s) to complete. (Exactly which transaction will be aborted is difficult to predict and should not be relied upon.)</li><li>Note that deadlocks can also occur as the result of row-level locks (and thus, they can occur even if explicit locking is not used). Consider the case in which two concurrent transactions modify a table. [The first transaction updates row A, then the second transaction updates row B, then the first transaction tries to update row B, sees the lock is held by the second transaction and waits, and finally, the second transaction tries to update row A but can’t because the lock for row A is held by the first transaction which is waiting for it to finish.]</li></ul></li></ul>","contentLength":11410,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Want To Win Your Share of $2000?

Learning how AI is influencing data center infrastructure trends will clarify how the technology makes essential services more reliable and why you might see AI updates becoming more commonplace in data centers globally.</p><p>A data center is a facility housing storage systems that are essential for business operations and consumer services. The physical or virtual networks support a variety of online activities, including:</p><ul></ul><p>People in nearly every industry rely on those daily actions or programs in some way. They’re foundational in professional and personal routines, so building new data centers and making existing locations more efficient is crucial.</p><h2>Ways AI Might Assist Data Center Operations</h2><p>Incorporating AI into data center logistics isn’t a futuristic possibility. Industry leaders are using it to benefit their daily operations in more ways than one.</p><h3>Energy Consumption May Decrease With AI Monitoring</h3><p>Supporting nationwide or global online activities requires 24/7 electricity services. The intense processing makes data centers consume  per floor than a standard office building. AI could mitigate that usage by investigating consumption from within.</p><p>\\\nThe deep learning algorithms can monitor operations around the clock, noting where each wattage goes and which parts of a data center are working the hardest. When team leaders receive reports on the most energy-intensive machines, they can adjust or upgrade the hardware as necessary. AI could remove the guesswork of targeting electricity waste, especially if it collects daily operations data for comparative reviews over time.</p><h3>The Algorithms Can Provide Predictive Maintenance Tips</h3><p>AI is influencing data center infrastructure trends through its predictive maintenance abilities. When they have hardware issues that require downtime, essential services like cloud storage backups and virtual communications must pause. The disruption to commercial and residential activities causes issues like financial or personal information loss.</p><p>\\\nAutomation may reduce downtime or equipment failure by monitoring for predictive maintenance opportunities. Integrated team members will get alerts when software updates are necessary so they don’t get lost. They could also receive reminders to update certain hardware that’s lagging in performance. The program will know when part of the data center isn’t as efficient, drawing attention to it for improvements before the part fails and causes center-wide outages.</p><h3>AI May Enhance Operational Efficiency</h3><p>Predictive analytics allows AI to see inefficiencies the human eye might not catch. If a model is monitoring and directing CPU usage, it could direct some units to idle because they frequently overwork. Once data center teams see which parts idle most often, they can virtualize those machines to boost CPU utilization by 40%-60% so their centers reach new efficiency levels.</p><p>\\\nSome software also improves team communication. The routine reports provided by the predictive analytics program ensure everyone has the information they need to understand their data center’s current strengths and weaknesses. They can make more informed decisions moving forward rather than hoping human error like miscommunication doesn’t stop everyone from getting the details to enhance overall performance.</p><h3>Digital Security Could Improve Through AI Assistance</h3><p>Modern cybersecurity measures are crucial for fortifying a data center’s integrity. People trust those centers to keep their information safe, which is why AI’s security assistance can become a significant benefit to daily operations.</p><p>\\\nAI models monitor data input and organization. When unusual patterns appear, it runs them through a logged history of operational patterns. Anything unusual stands out, which can trigger early alerts of security breaches before the staff identifies them.</p><p>\\\nFaster incident response reduces the risk of widespread data loss or downtime. Improving consumer trust in data center operations, keeping businesses open and preventing personal information loss to cyber criminals are crucial. AI can assist in those efforts to streamline operations.</p><h2>Potential Challenges Data Center Teams May Face</h2><p>Adding AI programs to data centers could provide many benefits, but change also comes with challenges. You can expect to see experts tackling these biggest roadblocks as AI becomes more important for daily processes.</p><p>Incorporating new software into any corporate structure costs money. Using AI for security enhancements, electricity monitoring and predictive maintenance analytics is only possible after paying for a software license that is big enough for an entire data center.</p><p>\\\nExperts estimate hardware costs for new and improving data centers will cost , meaning industry leaders are already spending vast amounts of money. Adding AI fees could be too much for some to afford right away.</p><h3>Outdated Infrastructure May Require Replacement</h3><p>Using the latest technology to keep up with data processing and storage means continually advancing tech in data centers is crucial. Outdated hardware is a problem, as a center’s older computer systems may not be able to use AI programs to their full potential. Replacing them before investing in new software is an additional cost some may be unable to cover.</p><p>\\\nReplacing older infrastructure is an especially concerning problem for data centers using equipment built before virtual storage became more mainstream. Their servers may have less computing power or memory than newer models. If the leading AI programs rely on an up-to-date device’s capabilities, upgrading costly servers may be an unavoidable part of integration.</p><p>Changing operational processes almost always requires some amount of team training. You’ve likely sat through training sessions before, regardless of your profession. The quick lessons ensure everyone’s on the same page and limit downtime due to confusion.</p><p>\\\nData center workers will need similar training opportunities while adjusting to the automated support systems. As of 2023,  in data centers nationwide. The time required to create training materials and educate that number of employees could complicate a team’s initial AI integration plan.</p><p>Trends are emerging as more facilities use AI in daily data center operations. Data governance strategies will likely change as they feed their new AI models. Once teams use better governance opportunities to understand which data they own, its current structure and its primary sources, their AI will operate more efficiently.</p><p>\\\nAI quantum computing may also become more mainstream. Data center teams will have to keep up with the intensified service demand related to quantum processing. AI could analyze the larger data loads more effectively if they are robust enough to handle them. Stronger algorithms will likely become more widespread as the quantum computing landscape evolves.</p><h2>Expect Data Center Infrastructure Updates for AI Integration</h2><p>Once you start learning how AI is influencing data center infrastructure trends, it’s easier to see why so many locations are undergoing substantial upgrades. Industry leaders could use the new algorithms to improve daily operations and secure their data more efficiently if they can manage the operational costs associated with AI incorporation.</p><p>\\\nIf you’re looking forward to a future of more cloud services and data processing, staying up to date with how each center is utilizing the latest tools will keep you informed on the exciting progress.</p>","contentLength":7652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Are AI PDF Tools Putting Your Data at Risk? Here’s a Safer Way to Merge PDFs","url":"https://hackernoon.com/are-ai-pdf-tools-putting-your-data-at-risk-heres-a-safer-way-to-merge-pdfs?source=rss","date":1742813182,"author":"Zohaib","guid":13325,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We all use PDF files in our everyday work life, whether it is to share invoices or contracts, send legal documents, or just want to appear more professional with our proposals. In a more professional setting, the ability to merge multiple PDF files efficiently without compromising on the confidentiality is utmost essential. And when we’re talking about security, it’s important to remember we’re not always as safe as we think we are– especially when it comes to storing digital assets.</p><p>\\\nA leak of any sensitive document can lead to catastrophic results for any organization, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, aside from manpower required to stabilize the situation. That’s why uploading sensitive PDFs to any external platform, whether it’s for editing or some other reason, cannot be considered 100% safe. Sure, these AI driven platforms advertise the use of cutting-edge <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/\">GPT-4 processes</a> to manage documents and promise utmost security, but is it wise to take these claims at their face value?</p><p>Well, the good news is that there are now privacy-first tools that let you manage and combine PDFs right in your browser. You don’t have to upload any files or documents to any external server, which may expose your data to possible theft. In this guide, we’ll talk about:</p><p>\\\n● Whether AI platforms are a viable option for combining your PDFs securely</p><p>\\\n● Highlight some challenges (or risks) associated with AI-based tools</p><p>\\\n● And lastly, talk about best practices regarding combining PDFs securely</p><p>\\\nBy the end, we promise that you’ll feel confident about the whole process while keeping your data private and completely under your control.</p><p>AI-based PDF combine tools are based on language models like GPT-4 from open AI and others. Now, if you’re unfamiliar with language models, know that they generate human-like text, summarize content, answer critical questions, and even assist in matters related to coding and file management. The sheer versatility makes it a leading choice for automating and simplifying many workflows. But when we’re talking about handling PDFs, you must understand how the language model actually operates.</p><p>\\\nThe thing is, most AI-based tools don't have built-in features that would allow it to directly edit and manipulate PDF files. What it can do instead is analyze and interpret the text within the PDF if it has been converted to a different format and then fed into the language model. For tasks like merging, splitting, or reordering regular PDF pages, GPT-4 or any other language model is required to be first integrated into a third-party platform using an API. These are the platforms that can handle direct file uploads and convert it to a format that’s compatible with the AI language model.</p><p>The process that we just described comes with a significant caveat- it typically requires uploading your files to external servers. Whether you’re using a chatbot, an AI-powered document tool, or a custom API integration, your PDFs are sent to remote servers for processing. The AI performs its computations off-site, and the results are sent back to you once the task is complete.</p><p>\\\nIf we’re talking about general documents where privacy is not an issue, then you don’t have to worry about it. But for businesses and other legal professionals, this method of manipulating PDFs does raise serious privacy concerns. Whenever you upload any document to an external server, there’s always a risk of falling prey to data breaches or misuse- particularly if the platform in question lacks the ability to protect your data or doesn’t have the required compliance certifications. We’ll talk more about the issue below.</p><p>Like we said before, as AI-powered platforms rise in popularity due to their convenience and efficiency, we must not ignore the privacy implications that accompany their use. This is especially true when we’re talking about dealing with sensitive documents in PDF format. The problem is that many users, especially casual users, may not realize that when they interact with tools built on models like GPT-4, they are entrusting their data to external servers. This data transmission process carries inherent risks that should not be overlooked.</p><h2>Where is the vulnerability present?</h2><p>In simple terms, it could be anywhere along the process, but here’s the basic gist of how it works. When you upload a PDF file to an AI platform the file is transmitted from your local device to remote servers owned or managed by the service provider. The contents of your document are often parsed, temporarily stored, and processed on these servers before any output is returned to you.</p><p>\\\nEven if the platform claims not to retain your files after processing, there is a window during which the document is exposed to third-party infrastructure. For corporations and legal professionals who are dealing with many types of sensitive data like proprietary contracts, client information, financial data, or other personal records, this is a massive red flag in terms of vulnerability.</p><p>\\\nOver the years, there have been countless examples of data breaches across industries that expose millions of sensitive documents. Often, these data breaches aren’t even due to any malicious attack, but rather simple, overlooked mistakes like poor access controls, weak encryption, or overlooked security settings.</p><p>There are problems beyond unauthorized access, believe it or not, there are issues of regulatory compliance that could pose a huge headache. In regions with strict data protection laws, like Europe’s GDPR or the U.S.’s HIPAA, sending confidential documents to third-party servers can lead to compliance issues. These regulations often require businesses to maintain tight control over where their data is stored, how it’s processed, and who can access it. Using AI tools that rely on external servers can make it much harder to meet these requirements.</p><p>\\\nAnother concern you just cannot ignore is <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/navigating-data-security-risks-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence\">how AI platforms handle your data</a>. Many tools, including those powered by GPT-4 often reserve the right to use your uploaded files to further improve and train their models or services. While reputable providers often let users opt out of data usage for training, these details are usually buried in terms and conditions that most people don’t read. This basically means that your PDFs could potentially be used in ways you didn’t intend.</p><p>Then there’s the issue of transparency. The lack of transparency in how AI platforms manage data adds to the problem. Users rarely have clear insight into the security measures these third-party providers use, nor do they have real-time control over how their data is handled. This is especially worrying when dealing with sensitive documents — things like personal information, trade secrets, legal contracts, or anything covered by confidentiality agreements.</p><p>\\\nIn short, the risks are real, and they’re worth considering before uploading your sensitive files.</p><p>To address the growing concerns around data security and user privacy, companies are coming up with a new class of tools that aim to give the users complete control over their personal information. These are what we call privacy first PDF tools, and these tools operate differently than conventional online services that process files on an external remote server. You’d be glad to know that privacy-first tools can operate entirely on your local device or browser. This ensures that no data ever leaves your domain of control.</p><p>Like we said before, all privacy-first PDF tools work on the simple principle of not letting the user data leave their control. This means all file processing and managing happens locally. when you upload, merge, or edit PDF files using such a tool, the actions are carried out directly on your device. No copies of your documents are sent to third-party servers for computation, nor are they stored elsewhere. As a result, there is zero risk of your data being intercepted, accessed, or mishandled by external parties.</p><p>\\\nOne of the key features that distinguishes these tools is that they do not require installation or registration. You can open the tool in your browser, perform the desired operation, and download the result, all without creating an account, sharing personal details, or granting permissions that could compromise security. This streamlined approach is not only convenient but also reduces attack surfaces where sensitive information might otherwise be collected.</p><h3><strong>Works across different operating systems</strong></h3><p>Most of these PDF tools are built to function seamlessly across different platforms. So, it doesn’t matter whether you use Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, etc, they’re designed to run within your preferred browser (as long as it’s not obscure) and deliver consistent performance. Such cross compatibility gets rid of the need to install different software or pay close attention to privacy protection.</p><h3><strong>No logging of user data or activity</strong></h3><p>Another advantage of privacy-first PDF tools is that they don’t log user activity, store uploaded files, or maintain any records of processed documents. This makes them ideal for professionals, individuals, and businesses that must comply with data protection regulations or internal confidentiality policies.</p><h3><strong>No steady internet connection needed</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve opened the website and loaded the tool, you can safely disconnect from the internet and keep working on merging your PDFs. These tools have been built to work offline, which adds another layer of security by blocking all possibilities of online data transmission. A great example of one such tool is <a href=\"https://www.pdftool.org/en/merge-pdf\">PDF Combiner</a>, an AI and cybersecurity tool that allows users to merge, reorder, or modify PDF files entirely within the browser without any internet connection.</p><p>\\\nThese are the three main advantages privacy-first AI tools have over AI-based platforms and cloud services. They not only secure your data, but offer peace of mind since you know that your sensitive information stays fully private and under your control.</p><p>To combine or edit PDFs securely, you must know the difference between tools that use AI and tools that put privacy first. Of course, both have their perks, but they also handle your data very differently. While AI tools are amazing for extracting information or summarizing data, they do need the user to upload the file to an external server. Regular confidentiality issues aside, you might also come across compliance problems if regulations like GDPR or HIPAA are involved.</p><p>\\\nPrivacy-first tools, on the other hand, keep everything on your device and work through your browser, even without internet connection. This makes sure that the files never leave your computer as there are no uploads involved. AI tools have their perks, but if protecting your privacy is your primary concern, better steer clear of them.</p><p>Now that we’ve established how crucial protecting your privacy is and how privacy-first PDF tools can help, let’s talk about what else you can do to further safeguard your data against theft, misuse, and compliance violations. Most users who deal with sensitive PDFs skip this step and risk putting themselves in great danger; don’t be like them.</p><p>The first (and arguably the most important) thing you need to do is figure out if the PDF tool you’re about to use needs you to upload files or not. This seemingly basic step is something that quite often gets ignored as users quickly jump from one online service to another without going through the privacy policies. Honestly, who does? Since so <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html\">many PDF merging services are cloud based</a>, they naturally store your sensitive files on external servers, which poses a privacy risk.</p><p>\\\nMany of these service providers aren’t even honest with their claims- meaning there’s a chance of your files being temporarily stored elsewhere even if the provider claims that they delete files once they’ve been processed. What’s even more concerning is the fact that you, as a user, have no control or visibility over how long your files are retained or if they’re deleted at all at a certain time in the future.</p><p>\\\nSadly, even when certain encrypted transmission methods are used, the mere presence of your sensitive files on third-party servers introduces vulnerabilities and chance of compliance violations. This is especially true if the data comes under protection laws like GDPR or HIPAA. Now, this might feel like a BIG ask, but we highly recommend you to take some time out to examine the privacy policy and technical documentations of the PDF merger tool you’re about to use.</p><p>\\\nCheck if there’s any mention of local processing, or do they guarantee no file uploads? The more transparent the documentation is, the better. If the service doesn’t explicitly mention that your sensitive files are processed locally, you can assume they are uploaded on some external server. If that’s the case, it’s best you don’t use the tool and look for something else.</p><h2>Prioritize no-upload solutions</h2><p>If you’ve managed to determine how your preferred tool handles files, you must seek out client-side solutions that perform all the processing within your local device. These browser-based tools go a long way to ensure that your sensitive data doesn’t leave your system, thereby mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and data theft. Of course, server storage is equally bad, so let’s not forget about that.</p><p>\\\nWhen it comes to privacy-first PDF tools, instead of sending your files off to any external server, they rely on your browser to do most of the heavy lifting. The best part, of course, is that you remain in complete control as your documents stay on your device. There’s another big plus: you don’t have to worry about the tool’s server policies or whether their systems are up and running. These no-upload tools work the same way every time, no matter what. And many of them even work offline, giving you an extra layer of privacy and flexibility.</p><h2>Avoid public or shared wi-fi networks</h2><p>Nobody talks about this, but it’s crucial that you don’t use public or shared wi-fi in unknown locations while working on merging your PDF files. Public networks available in places like coffee shops, airports, and even hotels (including 5-star properties) lack proper encryption methods to safeguard your data. This makes them a top choice for various types of cyber attacks or phishing. One such common threat is called man-in-the-middle or MITM attack.</p><p>\\\nIn such a scenario, a malicious individual can intercept the data that’s being transmitted between your device and the network- even if you’re using a no-upload tool. What they exploit are usually browser history, any open tabs, or cookies. Moreover, these attackers can get hold of unsecured networks to inject malware, which further compromises device security. That’s why it’s so important to stay vigilant when you’re dealing with sensitive information.</p><p>\\\nSo, what’s the solution? Well, whenever you’re working on PDFs, do it on a secure network, whether it’s in your home or workplace. Wi-fi with <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/what-is-wpa3-secure-wifi-how-to-set-it-up-on-your-router\">strong encryption like WP3 can protect you</a> to a good extent. And if you’re traveling or on-the-go and you find yourself needing to combine PDFs, be sure to use a trusted VPN while doing so. The advantage VPN offers is that it encrypts all traffic from your device, thus guarding your activity from potential attack or theft.</p><h2>Keep your operating system and browser updated</h2><p>Some people are against constantly updating their OS, and somewhat rightfully so. After all, who wants to fix something that’s not broken? However, it’s important to remember that OS and browser updates happen for a reason, and one of those reasons is related to security. Security related issues are constantly discovered and patched through these software updates and without them, cybercriminals would easily be able to get a hold of your sensitive personal data.</p><p>\\\nIf you neglect these updates like many people do, you’d be leaving your device vulnerable to unnecessary risks. For instance, malicious individuals frequently target browsers because people use them to handle a variety of tasks, which include but are not limited to file downloads, processing scripts, etc. That’s why when dealing with merging sensitive PDFs, you must ensure that both your OS and browser are up to date.</p><h2>Clear local files and browser cache after processing</h2><p>Here’s something that often goes unnoticed– even if you’re using a privacy-first PDF tool, residual data can sometimes remain on your device after processing. Some examples of residual data are cached content, temporary files, and session cookies. These may still be present in either your browser’s memory or in hard drive storage. If you don’t clear these leftover data, overtime they could pose a security risk, especially if others have access to your device.</p><p>\\\nOnce you’ve merged your <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-universal-benefits-of-pdfua\">PDF files</a> and saved them locally, make a habit of immediately clearing any unnecessary data. Not to forget you must also delete any local copies of the original PDF file from your system, if they’re no longer needed. Taking this extra step will ensure that your device has no traces of sensitive information left behind.</p><p>You can most certainly combine PDF files securely without sacrificing privacy, and do it without using any fancy sounding AI tool either. By using a privacy-first PDF combine tool and taking some basic precautions as outlined in this guide, you can make sure that your sensitive data remains where it should- with you.

Clary","guid":13324,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Most people are afraid of being alone with their thoughts.</p><p>\\\nThey fill every moment with noise, distraction, and cheap dopamine. Social media. Netflix. Group hangouts. Mindless scrolling.</p><p>\\\nAnything to avoid the discomfort of their own company.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The most productive time you will ever have is the time that seems most \"boring\" compared to others.</strong></p><p>\\\nThose hours of solitude. The long walks where you work through complex problems in your head. The mornings spent in deep focus while the rest of the world is still sleeping.</p><p>\\\nThis is your hidden advantage in a world that can't tolerate silence or stillness.</p><h2><strong>The Addiction To Stimulation</strong></h2><p>\\\nThe average person checks their phone 96 times a day. That's once every 10 minutes.</p><p>\\\nThey bounce between meetings, calls, and collaborative work. They mistake busyness for productivity and motion for progress.</p><p>\\\nAnd at the end of the day, what do they have to show for it?</p><p>\\\nA bunch of half-finished tasks. A mind scattered in a thousand directions. And the nagging feeling that despite all their activity, they haven't moved the needle on anything that truly matters.</p><p>\\\nHere's the brutal truth: <strong>Constant stimulation is making you stupid.</strong></p><p>\\\nYour brain needs periods of quiet and boredom to:</p><ul><li>Make unexpected connections</li></ul><p>\\\nBut most people can't tolerate even five minutes without reaching for their phone.</p><p>\\\nThey've conditioned their minds to crave the next hit of novelty, and they're paying for it with their creative potential.</p><p>\\\n<em>Are you willing to be different?</em></p><h2><strong>The Strategic Advantage Of Solitude</strong></h2><p>Some of history's greatest thinkers understood the power of solitude.</p><p>\\\nEinstein took long walks alone to solve physics problems. Newton discovered gravity during a period of isolated study when universities closed due to the plague. Maya Angelou rented hotel rooms where she would write in solitude for hours.</p><p>\\\nThis isn't coincidence. It's causation.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Deep work requires deep focus, and deep focus requires isolation from distraction.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen you create space for yourself to think deeply, you're not being antisocial or unproductive. You're giving yourself the most valuable gift possible: uninterrupted thought.</p><p>\\\nThis is where breakthroughs happen. Where connections form that others miss. Where you develop the clarity to see opportunities invisible to the chronically distracted.</p><p>\\\nIn a world optimized for shallow work and instant gratification, your ability to go deep is your superpower.</p><h2><strong>Why Boredom Makes You Better</strong></h2><p>Remember being bored as a kid?</p><p>\\\nNot the pleasant boredom of a lazy summer day. The excruciating, \"I-have-nothing-to-do\" boredom that drove your parents crazy.</p><p>\\\nThat boredom wasn't useless. It was the catalyst for creativity.</p><p>\\\nWhen there's nothing to entertain you, your mind is forced to entertain itself. It starts making connections, generating ideas, and solving problems. It craves stimulation, so it creates it.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Boredom is the space where creativity is born.</strong></p><p>\\\nToday's world has engineered boredom out of existence. There's always something to watch, read, or listen to. Always someone to talk to.</p><p>\\\nStudies show that children who experience boredom develop better problem-solving skills and greater creativity. Adults who embrace boredom report higher levels of creativity and productivity.</p><p>\\\nThe most successful people I know deliberately create  in their schedules – times when they do nothing but think, reflect, and let their minds wander.</p><p>\\\nThey understand that insights rarely come from consuming more information. They come from giving your mind space to process what you already know.</p><h2><strong>The Walk That Changed Apple</strong></h2><p>In 2011, Steve Jobs was working on what would become one of Apple's most revolutionary products: Siri.</p><p>\\\nBut he wasn't in a lab. He wasn't in a meeting. He wasn't even at his desk.</p><p>\\\nJobs was famous for his walking meetings. He believed that walking sparked creativity and allowed for deeper conversations than sitting in a conference room.</p><p>\\\nOne particular walk with his biographer Walter Isaacson reveals his thinking:</p><p>\\\n\"If you just sit and act, then you're going to die,\" Jobs told Isaacson during one of their walks. \"Taking a walk gives you time to think about a problem differently.\"</p><p>\\\nDuring these seemingly \"boring\" walks, Jobs made some of his most important decisions and had his most creative insights.</p><p>\\\nThis wasn't unique to Jobs. Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Charles Darwin all incorporated long walks into their daily routines.</p><p>\\\nThey understood that <strong>movement combined with solitude creates the perfect conditions for breakthrough thinking.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe next time you're stuck on a problem, don't call another meeting. Take a walk alone instead.</p><h2><strong>The Silent Retreat Of Billionaires</strong></h2><p>Bill Gates has a strange habit.</p><p>\\\nTwice a year, he disappears for a \"Think Week\" – seven days of complete solitude in a secluded cabin. No phone, no internet, no family, no friends. Just books, notebooks, and time to think.</p><p>\\\nDuring these periods of intense solitude, Gates reads, reflects, and maps out the future of Microsoft and his foundation. Many of Microsoft's pivotal strategic shifts originated during these \"boring\" weeks in the woods.</p><p>\\\nGates isn't alone. Jack Dorsey does 10-day silent meditation retreats. Ray Dalio attributes much of his success to his meditation practice.</p><p>\\\nNaval Ravikant starts each day with an hour of solitude.</p><p>\\\nThese aren't coincidences. These are strategic choices by some of the world's most successful people.</p><p>\\\nThey know what most don't: <strong>Innovation happens in isolation, not in collaboration.</strong></p><p>\\\nTeams are great for execution, but breakthrough insights almost always come from individual thought.</p><p>\\\nIf you want to think thoughts no one has thought before, you need to create conditions no one else is creating. And that usually means embracing solitude in a world addicted to connection.</p><h2><strong>How To Create Your Own Boring Advantage</strong></h2><p>You don't need a cabin in the woods or a week away from civilization to harness the power of \"boring\" productivity.</p><h3><strong>1. Schedule Deep Work Blocks</strong></h3><p><strong>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.</strong></p><p>\\\nBlock out 2-3 hours in your calendar for uninterrupted focus. Turn off notifications. Close your door. Tell people you're unavailable.</p><p>\\\nThen work on your most important project with complete focus.</p><p>\\\nThe first few times will be uncomfortable. Your mind will crave distraction. Push through it. Like any muscle, your focus gets stronger with use.</p><p>\\\nTwo hours of true deep work will produce more value than eight hours of distracted shallow work.</p><h3><strong>2. Take Daily Thinking Walks</strong></h3><p>The simplest productivity hack is also the most powerful: a daily walk with no phone, no podcasts, no music.</p><p>\\\nJust you and your thoughts.</p><p>\\\nStart with 20 minutes. Let your mind wander. Notice what emerges when you're not filling your brain with input.</p><p>\\\nAsk yourself open-ended questions:</p><ul><li>What am I missing in my current strategy?</li><li>What would make the biggest difference in my business right now?</li><li>What would this look like if it were easy?</li></ul><p>\\\n<strong>Walking physically changes your brain chemistry in ways that enhance creative thinking.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe combination of light physical activity and distraction-free thinking creates the perfect conditions for insights.</p><h3><strong>3. Implement Strategic Boredom</strong></h3><p>Once a week, schedule an hour of pure boredom.</p><p>\\\nSit in a chair. No phone. No book. No music. No journaling. Just you and your thoughts.</p><p>\\\nThe first 20 minutes will be excruciating. Your mind will beg for stimulation. Give it nothing.</p><p>\\\nAfter about 30 minutes, something magical happens. Your brain, starved for input, starts generating its own. Ideas emerge. Connections form. Problems that seemed unsolvable suddenly have obvious solutions.</p><p>\\\nThis is your mind doing what it was built to do before we started bombarding it with constant stimulation.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Boredom isn't the absence of thought. It's the beginning of deeper thought.</strong></p><p>Most people are drowning in information while starving for wisdom.</p><p>\\\nThey consume endless content without giving themselves time to process it.</p><ul><li>One day per week with no new information input</li><li>No social media, news, podcasts, or videos</li><li>Review your notes from what you've already learned</li><li>Ask yourself: \"What does this mean for me and my work?\"</li></ul><p>\\\nYou already know enough to be wildly successful. The problem isn't lack of information. It's lack of implementation.</p><p>\\\nWhen you create boundaries around information consumption, you force yourself to metabolize what you've already learned rather than constantly seeking the next insight.</p><p>Let's be honest: there's nothing sexy about sitting alone with your thoughts.</p><p>\\\nWhen someone asks what you did yesterday, \"I took a two-hour walk and thought about my business strategy\" doesn't sound as impressive as \"I had meetings with three potential clients and launched a new marketing campaign.\"</p><p>\\\nBut results speak louder than activity.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The most successful people have the courage to be boring.</strong></p><p>\\\nThey're willing to do the unsexy work of thinking deeply, planning carefully, and executing with focus. They're comfortable saying no to distractions that others can't resist.</p><p>\\\nWhile everyone else is trying to look busy and important, they're creating space for the thought and focus that actually moves the needle.</p><p>\\\nDon't mistake their quietness for inaction. The still waters run deep.</p><h2><strong>The Hard Truth About Your Productivity</strong></h2><p>You will never reach your potential if you can't tolerate being alone with your thoughts.</p><p>\\\nThe ability to think deeply for extended periods is becoming increasingly rare and increasingly valuable. As the world gets noisier, the advantages of silence grow stronger.</p><p>\\\nThe most valuable work you'll ever do won't happen in meetings or on collaborative documents or in crowded coworking spaces.</p><p>\\\nIt will happen in moments of isolation that would bore most people to tears.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Your competitive advantage lives in the space between stimuli.</strong></p><p>\\\nIn the quiet moments when others reach for their phones, you reach for deeper thoughts. In the morning hours when others are still sleeping, you're solving problems. In the walks that others fill with podcasts, you're generating ideas.</p><p>\\\nNot by working more hours. Not by being perpetually busy. Not by constant collaboration.</p><p>\\\nBut by embracing the boring, silent spaces where true productivity lives.</p><p>\\\nThe question is – are you comfortable enough with yourself to find out what's waiting for you in the silence?</p>","contentLength":10305,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"OpenAI Introduces Controversial o1 Pricing Model","url":"https://hackernoon.com/openai-introduces-controversial-o1-pricing-model?source=rss","date":1742812298,"author":"This Week in JavaScript","guid":13323,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hello JavaScript Enthusiasts!</p><p>\\\nWelcome to a new edition of \"\"!</p><p>\\\nToday, we're covering OpenAI's controversial pricing model, the heated Next.js vs TanStack debate, and game-changing tool releases- plus optimization techniques you won't want to miss!</p><h3><strong>Next.js vs TanStack: The Framework Showdown</strong></h3><p>\\\n<strong>Why Developers Are Switching:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simplicity vs. Complexity:</strong> Next.js offers high-scale optimization but with a steeper learning curve</li><li> TanStack provides cleaner APIs that feel more intuitive</li><li> Do you really need SSR, ISR, PPR, and other acronyms for most projects?</li><li> TanStack paired with Vite delivers faster compile times</li></ul><p>\\\nThe tradeoff?

But here’s the big question—are they really leading to the revolution we all expected, or are they failing? (Spoiler:  😅).</p><p>\\\nSo, if they’re failing, why is that? 🤔</p><p>\\\nWell, simply read this article and find out! 👇</p><h2>Wait… But What Are AI Agent Browsers?</h2><p>AI agent browsers, also known as , are tools that let AI agents control web browsers like human users.</p><p>\\\nYou write a prompt, and the AI takes control of the browser to complete tasks, like navigating pages, filling out forms, scraping data, and automating workflows:</p><p>\\\nThese tools—often powered by open-source libraries or frameworks—bridge the gap between AI and the web, performing tasks that usually require human interaction. Their goal? Helping you save time on tedious tasks by letting AI handle them efficiently and effectively. ⏳</p><h2>The Brutal Truth About AI Agent Browser Failures</h2><p>Now, you might think the \"AI agent browser failures\" we’re talking about are just AI messing up tasks from a prompt. Sure, that’s definitely an issue, and there are some trending videos on X of AI browsers failing over and over again… 🤖💀</p><p>\\\nJust like early AI image generators that couldn’t draw hands to save their lives but now create realistic images that fool most people, AI agent browsers are still in their awkward phase—but <strong>they’ll only get better with time</strong>.</p><p>\\\nYeah, even those AI-generated videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti are only getting better and better… 🍝</p><p>\\\nSo, the real reason “AI agent browsers are failing” isn’t just their occasional clumsiness—<strong>it’s because most websites can block them with ease!</strong> 🛑</p><p>\\\nAt the end of the day, AI browsers are still bots, and modern websites are packed with anti-bot defenses designed to stop them.</p><p>\\\nThink about it: AI-powered automation is cool, but companies are already  (remember,  🚨). No wonder businesses (and we, as users) are fed up. This new wave of browser agents is only <strong>fueling the arms race between bots and anti-bot tech</strong>. 💪 🦾</p><p>\\\nTime to down the most common anti-bot techniques used to shut down AI browser agents—and why they’re so brutally effective. 👀</p><p>\\\nShocking, right? A tool built specifically to block bots… that is actually good at blocking bots. Who would’ve thought? 😐</p><p>\\\nBut here’s the real kicker—</p><p>\\\nHow does that work? Well, it involves collecting unique details about your browser, like screen resolution, browser version, OS version, installed plugins, and more, to create a \"fingerprint\" of your browser. It then compares this fingerprint with some known fingerprints to determine if a user looks like a human or not.</p><p>\\\nAt the end of the day, AI agent browsers aren't magic 🪄. They must interact with the underlying browser using known solutions like the <a href=\"https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/\">Chrome DevTools Protocol</a>. Or at least, that’s what most popular open-source libraries to build browser agents (like <a href=\"https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use\">browser-use</a>, based on Playwright) do! 🔧</p><p>\\\nThat said, <strong>browser automation tools leave some telltale signs and leaks</strong>—like special parameters and default configurations required to control browsers—that advanced fingerprinting systems can easily detect:</p><p>\\\nOnce detected, it’s game over as they automatically block your requests or, as often happens, show you a CAPTCHA.</p><p>\\\nWhile \"stealth plugins\" can patch the browser and hide those leaks, these patches are open-source, meaning anti-AI bot systems can study and bypass them. Long story short, it’s an ongoing battle with no real winner… ⚔️</p><p>\\\nWant to learn more about browser automation stealth plugins? Read the following articles:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/user-behavior-analytics\">User behavioral analysis</a>, or in short , is another powerful weapon websites can adopt to stop agent-based browsers. Unlike basic fingerprinting systems that focus on technical browser characteristics, UBA looks at how users interact with a site.</p><p>\\\nIn particular, a UBA system tracks behaviors like mouse movements 🖱️, scrolling patterns 📜, keystrokes ⌨️, and even how long someone spends on each page ⏱️. For a deep dive, check out the 27-minute read (yes, you read that right! 🤯) “<a href=\"https://www.mimic.sbs/antibot/On-Anti-Bot-Biometric-Protections.md/\">On Anti-Bot Biometric Protections</a>\" article.</p><p>\\\nAI agent browsers, no matter how human they try to act, tend to follow predictable patterns with unnaturally smooth or “perfect” mouse movements—easy to spot through UBA.</p><p>\\\nSure, not all sites adopt UBA, and for it to work effectively, a lot of data must be collected and analyzed in real time—which can be bandwidth-heavy 💻⇄💻. Also, UBA systems can sometimes generate false positives due to the heuristics and ML models behind them…</p><p>\\\nHowever, with AI agent browser bots on the rise, <strong>it’s clear UBA will play an even bigger role in bot detection</strong>—and in the future, these systems will become more affordable and effective than ever!</p><h3>Other Anti-Bot Tactics That Wreck AI Agent Browsers</h3><p>Stopping bots is an art, and it involves a lot of tricks! 🧙‍♂️</p><p>\\\nMost anti-bot systems have a lot of tools in their toolbox 🧰 and plenty of aces up their sleeves ♠️. Earlier, we explored the most effective ones against new AI agent browsers. But hey, there’s more:</p><p>Also, don’t miss the video below for a look at advanced and modern anti-bot tactics: 🎥</p><h2>Say Goodbye to AI Agent Browser Failures—Here’s the Fix!</h2><p>So, what have you learned in this article? 🤔</p><p>\\\nYou learned that most AI agent bots can easily be detected (and stopped) by existing anti-bot solutions. While some advanced systems block based on user behavior, most blocks still rely on classic techniques like fingerprinting and CAPTCHAs. 🔒</p><p>\\\nThus, we can say that the real weak point of AI agent browser agents isn't the AI automation tech itself, but the browser they use (usually Chromium or a modified version of it)—as <strong>that is easily detectable</strong>.</p><p>\\\nNow, imagine a browser that could:</p><ul><li><p>Scale infinitely in the cloud ☁️</p></li><li><p>Avoid IP bans with seamless proxy integration across 72 million high-quality residential IPs 🌍</p></li><li><p>Prevent browser fingerprinting issues 🕵️‍♂️</p></li><li><p>Bypass geo-restrictions with built-in proxy support 🌏</p></li><li><p>Automatically solve CAPTCHAs from popular providers like reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, SimpleCaptcha, and dozens of others 🛡️</p></li></ul><p>Well, that browser—if only it existed—would be much more effective than current AI agent browsers.

As geopolitical policy shifts and suspicions of greenwashing impact environmental, social, and governance investing, some of the industry’s brightest stocks are showing remarkable signs of resilience.</p><p>\\\nEven before the famously climate-sceptical Donald Trump returned for his second term as President of the United States, a clear pullback on ESG investing had interrupted the growth potential of sustainability-focused stocks on Wall Street.</p><p>\\\nAccording to the Association of Investment Companies’ annual ESG Attitudes Tracker, the number of private investors who say they consider environmental, social, and governance when investing fell for the third year in a row .</p><p>\\\nThis downward trend is striking when considering that the figure stood at 66% in 2021, 60% in 2022, and 52% in 2023.</p><p>\\\nPresident Trump’s bid to de-incentivize ESG firms by , including ‘all Environmental approvals’, has served as an indication that sustainability initiatives will carry no special favor in the White House for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\\\nWe’ve also seen more investors become wary of ‘greenwashing’, which occurs when businesses add bogus ESG claims to their brand with little tangible evidence of sustainable practices. In 2023, investor concerns over greenwashing  while unfounded claims undermined faith in the firms that had sought to ramp up their ESG credentials.</p><p>\\\nAlthough these factors point to a challenging playing field for renewable energy stocks, there are clear examples of sustainability stocks that are thriving despite low ESG investor sentiment. At a time when Wall Street is struggling to keep up with volatility and growing competition in the AI industry, it may be a perfect time for renewables to make a timely comeback.</p><p>\\\nWith this in mind, let’s explore the three brightest renewable energy stocks for investors to load onto their portfolios today:</p><p>:::warning\n<strong><em>Editor’s note: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Enovix Corporation (ENVX)</h2><p>It’s been a challenging start to 2025 for silicon lithium-ion specialists, Evonix Corporation (NASDAQ: ENVX), which saw its stock fall 26% lower over the first two months of the year. However, the battery manufacturer may prove to be available at a discounted price for investors.</p><p>\\\nThe stock reported Q4 2024 , while revenues for the full year climbed to $23.1 million, representing a substantial increase from $7.6 million in 2023.</p><p>\\\nCrucially, Enovix is a source of optimism because of the receipt of a  for its silicon batteries from an unidentified technology company.</p><p>\\\nThe batteries, which are intended for use in headset-based mixed-reality wearables, will begin shipping in mid-2025 and could be the beginning of more lucrative orders as wearable technology like smart glasses begins to become a more pervasive consumer technology.</p><p>\\\nInterestingly, Enovix also has meme stock credentials, and ranks 11th in Yahoo! Finance’s list of the best meme stocks to buy. This helps to provide another frontier in which ENVX can secure growth in 2025.</p><p>Another stock that’s experienced a weak start to 2025 but is packed with potential is solar energy small-cap stock Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ: RUN).</p><p>\\\nWith a market capitalization of around $1.46 billion, Sunrun is a smaller player on this list with plenty of room for growth.</p><p>\\\nWith a recent stock downgrade from Jeffries, which saw the stock cut from a ‘buy’ to ‘hold’ rating along with its price target , it’s clear that Sunrun is more of an addition with the future in mind.</p><p>\\\nDespite its challenges, Sunrun remains one of the United States’ biggest residential solar energy providers and almost doubled its market share in California alone in recent years.</p><p>\\\nThe company’s strong innovation pipeline has seen developments like the attaching of battery storage to 60% of its new projects, helping RUN to expand its addressable market as the execution of storage solutions climbed 126%.</p><p>\\\nWith Sunrun expecting to generate  in cash throughout 2025, this stock could become a growth leader in the renewable energy market.</p><h2>3. NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NNE)</h2><p>One renewable energy firm that’s experienced an exceptionally strong start to 2025 is NANO Nuclear Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NNE).</p><p>\\\nThe stock has rallied more than 20% in the opening two months of the year and appears to be building momentum.</p><p>\\\n“The company is advancing projects such as the ZEUS Solid State Storage Reactor and the ODIN Low-Pressure Salt Reactor, which aim to offer portable and reliable clean energy solutions,” explained Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at Freedom24.</p><p>\\\n“The recent acquisition of key nuclear technologies not only strengthens NNE's product portfolio but also enhances its competitive advantage in the nuclear energy sector. With significant capital raised and a strong cash position, NNE is well-positioned to fund its research and development initiatives while coping with potential market challenges.”</p><p>\\\nNANO is already making big moves in 2025, and recently  as chief technology officer and head of reactor development, who is richly experienced and expected to become a driving force in refining the company’s innovations.</p><p>Although renewable energy stocks have been caught up in the wider ESG downturn in recent years, stock market volatility may provide an opportunity for more sustainable companies to prove their worth on a global scale.</p><p>\\\nThis could see the brightest renewables stocks generating more sustainable levels of growth even in the challenging investment landscape that 2025 is proving to be.</p><p>\\\nThe sustainability boom may have been on the back burner, but its best stocks could be primed for impressive results over the coming months and years.</p>","contentLength":6338,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bitunix Becomes the Center of Attention at Web3 Amsterdam, Dominating as Title Sponsor","url":"https://hackernoon.com/bitunix-becomes-the-center-of-attention-at-web3-amsterdam-dominating-as-title-sponsor?source=rss","date":1742807966,"author":"Bitunix","guid":12759,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Singapore, March 21st, 2025 - In an extraordinary atmosphere at the unique Circa Amsterdam venue, the Web3 Amsterdam Conference took place on March 13th and 14th in the Dutch capital, where Bitunix exchange captured the spotlight as the Title Sponsor of the event.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe booth of the world’s fastest-growing <a href=\"https://www.bitunix.com/register?utm_source=hackernoon&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=web3-amsterdam&amp;utm_content=article\">cryptocurrency exchange attracted significant attention</a>, with visitors eager to learn more about Bitunix’s services.

There’s a whole philosophy behind a single word:</p><blockquote><p>Gluwa is named after <a href=\"https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EA%B8%80%EB%A3%A8%EC%99%80\">'Glory', the ironclad ship</a> that sailed the sea for the first time in the world . It symbolizes a paradigm shift . It suggests that Gluwa's goal is to create the world's first borderless financial platform .</p></blockquote><p>\\\nI was like, that’s interesting.</p><p>\\\n“The French navy was quick to realize that change was inevitable and they began to experiment with different ways to armor their vessels. The construction of the French ship Glorie began in April 1858 and she would feature a groundbreaking design. Her wooden hull would be encased in iron plate and she also was to have steam propulsion by means of an internal steam engine system. The Glorie was designed to be a broadside ironclad, with her guns arrayed in long side batteries, much as they had been on wooden ships for the previous 500 years. She was, however, not to be called a ship-of-the-line; rather she was an armored frigate, <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2022/august/glorie-and-warrior\">the term “ironclad”</a> did not yet having any meaning.”</p><p>\\\nThe same analogy can be applied to the blockchain technology. The very first, if any meaning at all, to come to a regular not-so-obsessed-with-tech Joe’s mind is where-the-crypto-grows. So, I was like, save me from this pain, show me what you can really do, my dear blockchain. Something practical and impactful.</p><p>\\\nI have to say, when it comes to finances, ignorance ain’t bliss. It’s cruel and unfair.</p><p>\\\nWhat about the “<strong>financially underserved countries</strong> such as Nigeria, Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Indonesia?” That’s like a lot of people.</p><p>\\\n“Traditional banking systems left <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2025/03/602_394041.html\">more than half of the world's population unbanked</a>, according to the World Bank, making it difficult for many people to access credit from mainstream lenders. To serve financially underserved countries, Gluwa uses its blockchain network, Creditcoin. The system records users' payment histories — such as utility bill payments — on a public blockchain, creating verifiable credit profiles. This infrastructure is integrated with a stablecoin-based financial network tied to fiat currency, making financial transactions more accessible. The system not only helps individuals without traditional banking access build credit profiles but also enables Western fintech lending companies to expand over borders. \"The U.S. financial system still relies heavily on paper-based processes, with digital systems merely replicating paper-based methods. Countries without such legacy infrastructure have the unique advantage of adopting today's best technologies from scratch,\" Oh said.”</p><p>\\\nNow, it’s starting to make sense, for real.</p><p>\\\n“A financial infrastructure development project using Creditcoin has benefited around 2 million Nigerians, significantly expanding financial access, according to the firm. Previously, only 200,000 people — just 0.1 percent of Nigeria's population — had access to financial services.\"</p><p>\\\nI guess this means that only 0.1 percent of the “other” world’s population, which is unbanked, financially underserved, and “less fortunate,” has access to financial services we take for granted. It’s no wonder “Gluwa signed a memorandum of understanding with the Central Bank of Nigeria” as an MVP of this country’s financial future.</p><h2><strong>We Live in a Material World, Or So I’m Told</strong></h2><p>Here’s a nice thing, I dare to say a positive “collateral damage,” standing in your way of fixing financial troubles. You start by dealing with one problem, but in order to make it, you end up with a list.</p><p>\\\n“While working to provide financial services to underbanked markets, Oh realized that many potential users also lacked internet connectivity. \"To truly serve these communities, we first needed to address their connectivity gap,\" Oh explained.”</p><p>\\\nSo, who are you gonna call when you have connectivity gap problems? Well, there’s one guy I can think of.</p><p>\\\nYou get the idea of how this problem is going to be solved. At the same time, I’m not saying that financial inclusion is all about sunshine and rainbows. So, read this without any illusion.</p><p>\\\n“Unlike many popular DeFi protocols, Gluwa’s RWA investments involve unsecured lending. This means that there are counterparty risks, with investors potentially losing their funds in the case of borrower default. Nevertheless, to-date, <a href=\"https://creditcoin.org/blog/top-real-world-assets-platforms/\">there have been 0 defaults on Gluwa’s RWA investment platform</a>, with legal protections in place to protect investors and recover funds in cases of default.”</p><p>\\\nThere’s also this: “Due to a heavy focus on deal-screening and risk management, only a limited number of Investment Opportunities (7) have been made available on the platform since launch. However, lower-yield, <strong>flexible withdrawal products are more consistently available</strong>.”</p><p>\\\nAnd, this: “Investment Deals are sourced and assessed by a professional but centralized counterparty — the Gluwa Fund LP. This creates a risk of human oversight or error. However, <strong>this risk is present in almost every RWA investment platform today</strong>.”</p><h2><strong>The Future of Financial Inclusion is Bright - Gluwa is Worth the Fight</strong></h2><p>“Traditional financial services operate within the oversight of a local or regional jurisdiction. That limits what lenders can do—and where they can do it. With a decentralized, permissionless blockchain network, there is no single entity that has full control of the network, removing those limitations. Gluwa is putting that freedom to good use, connecting everyday investors with capital opportunities in emerging markets and needed a technology foundation to support it all. The company <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1709609183358710412-gluwa-azure-banking-and-capital-markets-usa\">leverages Microsoft Azure to power its blockchain-related services</a>. There are two distinct sets of services offered on Azure, each designed to meet specific requirements: Gluwa and Creditcoin. The eponymously named Gluwa decentralized financial platform connects investors with financial institutions that lend to people who don’t have access to traditional funding options. Because financial institutions record loans on the Creditcoin network, investors are better informed and can gain valuable insights due to the natural transparency and immutability of the blockchain-based credit bureau.”</p><p>\\\nSo far, I’ve seen that where Gluwa’s financial door there’s the World Wide Web window. I wonder if there’s more?</p><p>\\\nHere’s the thing about money and financial inclusion. As soon as you get these resolved, you start thinking about better healthcare and education.</p><p>\\\n“While in Jigawa, Senator Shettima had earlier launched the 4th edition of the Expanded National Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Clinic, disclosing that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has ordered that a grant of N150,000 should be given to each of the business owners in the state as the federal government’s support to MSMEs across the country. He noted that the N150,000 grant is an outright grant that does not require beneficiaries to repay.

The darknet marketplace Silk Road brought it a lot of popularity, but also a lot of bad rep. Its decentralized nature (not issued or controlled by any government or company) was constantly misunderstood, but that wouldn’t last for much longer. Soon, other coins were created, more use cases came along, coin prices skyrocketed, millions of users joined —and regulators found themselves needing to include this asset in the laws of their countries, somehow.</p><p>\\\nThat “somehow” isn’t always good. Sometimes, they create laws to ban or limit this type of money significantly. Many times, they make it legal, but what that means, in practice, varies from territory to territory. </p><blockquote><p><strong>“legal (where all activities are permitted), partial ban (where one or more activity is not permitted), and general ban (where all activity is limited).”</strong></p></blockquote><p>\\\nThe practical side of those concepts is more complicated, though.</p><p>They say that all activities with crypto are permitted in countries in which it’s legal, but stop there, because terms and conditions apply. Just because crypto is legal doesn’t mean people can use it as they like without any requirements. For example, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) rules require related companies (like crypto exchanges) to verify identities and report suspicious transactions. This is to prevent illegal activities like money laundering or funding criminal organizations. So, while you can buy, sell, or trade crypto, you might need to provide personal information to comply with these laws.</p><p><strong>Businesses dealing with crypto often face even more rules. They might need special licenses to operate legally.</strong> For instance, in the European Union, the  (MiCA) regulation sets strict guidelines for crypto companies, including how they should protect customer funds and report their activities. Stablecoins without proper reserves are banned, and issuers of new coins have some strict requirements to comply with.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, there’s another magical word: taxes. Depending on the country, crypto transactions , just like any other financial activity. This means users need to keep records and report their earnings to tax authorities, depending on certain established limits.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Even in countries where crypto is partially banned, taxes could apply to individual users</strong>. The “partially banned” bit often refers to how financial companies are banned from handling these assets in that region. While individual users are free to transact with crypto, licenses aren’t granted for crypto companies there, and banks can’t provide services to crypto exchanges, for example. In this case, consumer protection and AML rules for crypto are usually nonexistent.</p><p>In countries where crypto is “fully banned”, most activities with it are forbidden. Its mere use can be punished by law, although possession alone is often not illegal. People have been arrested for crypto-related activities in places like , , , , and , where they have “full bans” on cryptocurrencies. Now, does that fully stop people from owning, trading, mining, or doing whatever with cryptos, even if they live there? Not really.</p><p>\\\nWe just need to check the  by Chainalysis to notice an interesting fact: exactly 50% of the countries in the top ten by global crypto adoption have partial or full bans on cryptocurrency. China, famous for its wide ban on crypto, is in the top 20 by adoption. <strong>Despite laws and warnings, people are still using cryptocurrency in these places. Just without all regulations designed to make this space safer, so banning crypto instead of legalizing it seems counterproductive.</strong></p><p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2025-03-24T09:04:38.772Z-yv1r9b0xvvyq8j1lxbtw8799\" alt=\"Countries with General Bans on Crypto (Atlantic Council)\"> \\n Decentralized cryptocurrencies were built to be censorship-resistant, and, as we’ve mentioned above, they’re not issued or controlled by a central entity. That’s why they can’t get effectively banned by anyone. There’s no company to blame or expel, but a wide network of nodes worldwide that authorities just can’t shut down all at the same time. However, while the governments are unable to shut down cryptocurrency networks, </p><h2>Decentralization is Freedom</h2><p>Decentralization is a very positive feature, because, even in countries where crypto is banned, people might still use it for any reason –legitimate, but also illegitimate. Of course, the country might consider it illegitimate according to its own laws, but its government's credibility and moral factors are different things. <strong>Some people rely on these assets to protect their savings from high inflation or unstable local currencies. Others use it to send money to family abroad or to protect from  by oppressive governments.</strong> In places with strict financial controls, crypto can also offer financial freedom and access to global markets.</p><p>\\\nIf you want to do any of those things and many more, the  could be for you. This is a fully decentralized and censorship-resistant crypto network, available for anyone, in any part of the world. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph () structure, and transactions are confirmed without middlemen like miners or “validators”. This high level of decentralization makes Obyte more resilient to censorship and restrictions. Plus, it’s fully legal in most countries, offering a secure and accessible way to use crypto.</p><p>:::info\nFeatured Vector Image by sentavio / </p>","contentLength":5426,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly turns down $800M acquisition offer from Meta","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/ai-chip-startup-furiosaai-reportedly-turns-down-800m-acquisition-offer-from-meta/","date":1742806827,"author":"Kate Park","guid":12735,"unread":true,"content":"<article>FuriosaAI, a South Korean startup that makes chips for AI applications, has rejected an $810 million acquisition offer from Meta.</article>","contentLength":129,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Building a Robust JS/TS Monorepo: Best Practices with Yarn, NX and Changesets","url":"https://hackernoon.com/building-a-robust-jsts-monorepo-best-practices-with-yarn-nx-and-changesets?source=rss","date":1742806657,"author":"Teimur Gasanov","guid":12756,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Nowadays, the rapid evolution of software development cannot be denied. The teams are growing, projects tend to be more complex. Companies spend significant resources to maintain a distributed codebase consisting of many fragments. Enter the monorepo - a single, unified repository that brings together all of your code. Far from being a trend, monorepos have recently become an architectural approach to house the entire codebase in one place. Teams obtain enhanced context sharing, smooth collaboration and a tool that naturally encourages code reuse.</p><h2>Setting Up Yarn Workspaces</h2><p>:::info\nNote: Throughout this article, whenever \"Yarn\" is mentioned, it specifically refers to Yarn v4—the latest version offering enhanced capabilities and improved performance.</p><h3>What are Yarn Workspaces?</h3><p>Workspaces are the packages of the monorepo, often called packages. They help you manage multiple packages in a single repository effortlessly. With workspaces. you can:</p><ul><li><p>Share Dependencies Easily:</p><p>Share common dependencies across your project seamlessly.</p></li><li><p>Simplify Dependency Management:</p><p>Yarn automatically links local packages, reducing duplication and easing development.</p></li><li><p>Accelerate Installations:</p></li></ul><p>While Yarn is the selected manager for this article thanks to its simplicity, speed, and extensive configuration options - it’s important to note that the right choice depends on your project’s specific needs, team preferences, and overall workflow. For instance, <a href=\"https://pnpm.io/installation\">PNPM</a> and <a href=\"https://turbo.build/\">Turborepo</a> are other modern tools that offer a wide range of features.</p><p>Yarn setup is a straightforward process. Follow the official guide to install and configure Yarn in your project: <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install\">Yarn Installation Guide</a>.</p><p>Once you’ve completed the installation, let’s move on to configuration. Since we’re using plug’n’play, you need to ensure that your IDE correctly recognizes dependencies. If you’re using VSCode, run:</p><pre><code># Typescript is required for VSCode SDK to set up correctly\nyarn add -D typescript@^5\nyarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode\n</code></pre><p>:::info\nIf you’re using another code editor, check for the available SDKs here: <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks#editor-setup\">Yarn Editor SDKs</a>.</p><p>At this point, you’re all set to start using Yarn.</p><h2>Organizing the Monorepo Structure</h2><p>Now that the package manager is configured, it’s time to design a scalable project organization. A clear, well-defined structure not only makes the repository easier to navigate but also promotes better code reuse. In this example, we’ll divide the codebase into three major categories:</p><ul><li><p>Client: Contains the final, deployable client products.</p></li><li><p>Server: Contains the final, deployable server products.</p></li><li><p>Client: For standalone UI widgets.</p></li><li><p>Server: For standalone backend business logic pieces.</p></li><li><p>Houses shared code such as design system components, constants, assets, and utilities. This is the context-free zone for storing reusable logic.</p></li></ul><p>To demonstrate the power of this folder structure, let’s start by adding these major folders to Yarn’s workspaces list. In your root package.json, add the following:</p><pre><code>\"workspaces\": [\n  \"apps/**\",\n  \"features/**\",\n  \"libs/**\"\n]\n</code></pre><p>This configuration tells Yarn to treat packages in these folders as local packages. Subsequent installations will ensure that dependencies for each package are properly set up and linked.</p><p>In this section, we'll walk through a minimal codebase example that illustrates how to bootstrap the monorepo. Instead of including full code snippets, I'll provide short examples with links to the complete files in <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets\">the repository created specifically for this article</a>.</p><h4>Bootstrapping Server Application</h4><p>We begin with a simple <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express API</a> for user authentication. This server application exposes a single endpoint () that utilizes a handler from another package.</p><pre><code>import express from \"express\";\nimport cors from \"cors\";\nimport { signInHandler } from \"@robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/sign-in-handler\";\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 1234;\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.use(\n  cors({\n    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || \"http://localhost:3000\",\n  })\n);\n\napp.post(\"/auth/signIn\", signInHandler);\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAs you can see, the  endpoint uses a handler imported from another package. That brings us to our next component: the server feature.</p><h4>Bootstrapping Server Feature</h4><p>The server feature encapsulates the authentication logic. In this package, we define the sign-in handler, which leverages a shared validation utility from the libs.</p><pre><code>import type { RequestHandler } from \"express\";\nimport {\n  passwordValidator,\n  usernameValidator,\n} from \"@robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/validator\";\n\nconst signInHandler: RequestHandler = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (!req.body) {\n    res.status(422).send(\"Request body is missing\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof req.body !== \"object\") {\n    res.status(422).send(\"Request body expected to be an object\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const { username, password } = req.body;\n  const usernameValidationResult = usernameValidator(username);\n  if (typeof usernameValidationResult === \"string\") {\n    res\n      .status(422)\n      .send(\"Invalid username format: \" + usernameValidationResult);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  const passwordValidationResult = passwordValidator(password);\n  if (typeof passwordValidationResult === \"string\") {\n    res\n      .status(422)\n      .send(\"Invalid password format: \" + passwordValidationResult);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Emulate a successful sign-in\n  if (username === \"test\" &amp;&amp; password === \"test1234\") {\n    res.status(200).send(\"Sign in successful\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  return res.status(422).send(\"Username or password is incorrect\");\n};\n\nexport default signInHandler;\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis approach sums up the authentication logic within its own package, allowing it to be developed and maintained independently. Notice how the validator utilities are imported from the <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/tree/main/libs/validator\">shared lib</a>.</p><h4>Bootstrapping Client Application</h4><p>Next, let’s look at the client side. In our client application, we build a simple website that enables user authentication by invoking the server API.</p><pre><code>\"use client\";\nimport { SignInForm } from \"@robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/sign-in-form\";\n\nconst API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || \"http://localhost:1234\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const handleSubmit = async (username: string, password: string) =&gt; {\n    const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/auth/signIn`, {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      },\n    });\n    if (response.status === 200) {\n      alert(\"Sign in successful\");\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (response.status === 422) {\n      alert(\"Sign in failed: \" + (await response.text()));\n      return;\n    }\n\n    alert(\"Sign in failed\");\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"w-full h-screen overflow-hidden flex items-center justify-center\"&gt;\n      &lt;SignInForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre><p>In this example, the  component is imported from a client feature package, which leads us to our final component.</p><h4>Bootstrapping Client Feature</h4><p>The client feature package provides the authentication form along with the shared validation logic. This avoids duplicating code and ensures consistency.</p><pre><code>import {\n  passwordValidator,\n  usernameValidator,\n} from \"@robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/validator\";\n\ninterface SignInFormProps {\n  onSubmit: (username: string, password: string) =&gt; void;\n}\n\nconst SignInForm = ({ onSubmit }: SignInFormProps) =&gt; {\n  const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt;) =&gt; {\n    event.preventDefault();\n\n    const username = (event.currentTarget[0] as HTMLInputElement).value;\n    const usernameValidationResult = usernameValidator(username);\n    if (typeof usernameValidationResult === \"string\") {\n      alert(usernameValidationResult);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    const password = (event.currentTarget[1] as HTMLInputElement).value;\n    const passwordValidationResult = passwordValidator(password);\n    if (typeof passwordValidationResult === \"string\") {\n      alert(passwordValidationResult);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    onSubmit(username!, password!);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Username\" /&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" /&gt;\n      &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SignInForm;\n</code></pre><p>\\\nHere, we again see the usage of the <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/tree/main/libs/validator\">validator</a> from our shared libs, ensuring that validation logic is centralized and easily maintained.</p><p>\\\nThat’s it for our minimal codebase example. Keep in mind that this code is a simplified illustration meant to demonstrate the basic structure and interconnection between Apps, Features, and Libs in a monorepo. You can expand upon these examples as needed to fit your project’s specific requirements.</p><p>Managing scripts in a monorepo can be challenging. While Yarn allows you <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/foreach\">to run scripts across multiple packages</a> using various conditions, it may require custom scripting for more granular control. This is where NX comes in: it provides an out-of-the-box solution for efficient, targeted script execution.</p><p>NX is a build system optimized for monorepos with advanced CI capabilities. With NX, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Run tasks efficiently in parallel</strong>: Leverage concurrency to speed up your builds.</li><li><strong>Identify dependency relationships</strong>: Understand connections among packages and scripts.</li><li><strong>Cache script execution results</strong>: Avoid redundant work by caching outputs.</li></ul><h3>Targeted Script Execution</h3><p>To harness NX’s capabilities, we first need to create an  file to define a set of rules for our scripts. Below is an example configuration:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"targetDefaults\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"^build\"\n      ],\n      \"outputs\": [\n        \"{projectRoot}/dist\"\n      ],\n      \"cache\": true\n    },\n    \"typecheck\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"^build\",\n        \"^typecheck\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"^build\",\n        \"^lint\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"defaultBase\": \"main\"\n}\n</code></pre><p>In plain English, this configuration means:</p><ul><li><p>The  script for a package depends on the successful build of its dependencies, and its output is cached.</p></li><li><p>The  script for a package depends on both the build and typecheck scripts of its dependencies.</p></li><li><p>The  script for a package depends on both the build and lint scripts of its dependencies.</p></li></ul><p>Now, let’s add scripts to the :</p><pre><code>  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build:all\": \"yarn nx run-many -t build\",\n    \"build:affected\": \"yarn nx affected -t build --base=${BASE:-origin/main} --head=${HEAD:-HEAD}\",\n    \"typecheck:all\": \"yarn nx run-many -t typecheck\",\n    \"typecheck:affected\": \"yarn nx affected -t typecheck --base=${BASE:-origin/main} --head=${HEAD:-HEAD}\",\n    \"lint:all\": \"yarn nx run-many -t lint\",\n    \"lint:affected\": \"yarn nx affected -t lint --base=${BASE:-origin/main} --head=${HEAD:-HEAD}\",\n    \"quality:all\": \"yarn nx run-many --targets=typecheck,lint\",\n    \"quality:affected\": \"yarn nx affected --targets=typecheck,lint --base=${BASE:-origin/main} --head=${HEAD:-HEAD}\"\n  }\n</code></pre><p>Here, we define four types of execution scripts:</p><ul><li><p> Checks the package’s types.</p></li><li><p> Runs both typecheck and lint.'</p></li></ul><p>Each script has two variations:</p><ul><li> Runs the script on all packages.</li><li> Runs the script only on packages affected by recent changes. The  and  environment variables allow you to specify a range (defaulting to  and the current ), enabling granular execution on pull requests. This can significantly save time and resources.</li></ul><h3>Managing Circular Dependencies</h3><p>NX also provides <a href=\"https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/dep-graph\">a built-in command</a> to generate a dependency graph, which can help in dependency cycles detection. The following script uses the NX graph output to check for circular dependencies and fails if any are found.</p><p>Create a file at <code>scripts/check-circulardeps.mjs</code> with the following content:</p><pre><code>import { execSync } from \"child_process\";\nimport path from \"path\";\nimport fs from \"fs\";\n\nconst hasCycle = (node, graph, visited, stack, path) =&gt; {\n  if (!visited.has(node)) {\n    visited.add(node);\n    stack.add(node);\n    path.push(node);\n\n    const dependencies = graph.dependencies[node] || [];\n    for (const dep of dependencies) {\n      const depNode = dep.target;\n      if (\n        !visited.has(depNode) &amp;&amp;\n        hasCycle(depNode, graph, visited, stack, path)\n      ) {\n        return true;\n      }\n\n      if (stack.has(depNode)) {\n        path.push(depNode);\n        return true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  stack.delete(node);\n  path.pop();\n  return false;\n};\n\nconst getGraph = () =&gt; {\n  const cwd = process.cwd();\n  const tempOutputFilePath = path.join(cwd, \"nx-graph.json\");\n  execSync(`nx graph --file=${tempOutputFilePath}`, {\n    encoding: \"utf-8\",\n  });\n  const output = fs.readFileSync(tempOutputFilePath, \"utf-8\");\n  fs.rmSync(tempOutputFilePath);\n  return JSON.parse(output).graph;\n};\n\nconst checkCircularDeps = () =&gt; {\n  const graph = getGraph();\n\n  const visited = new Set();\n  const stack = new Set();\n\n  for (const node of Object.keys(graph.dependencies)) {\n    const path = [];\n    if (hasCycle(node, graph, visited, stack, path)) {\n      console.error(\"🔴 Circular dependency detected:\", path.join(\" → \"));\n      process.exit(1);\n    }\n  }\n  console.log(\"✅ No circular dependencies detected.\");\n};\n\ncheckCircularDeps();\n</code></pre><ul><li>Executes the NX command to generate a dependency graph.</li><li>Reads the graph from a temporary JSON file.</li><li>Recursively checks for cycles.</li><li>Logs an error and exits if a circular dependency is detected.</li></ul><h2>Validating Dependencies with Yarn Constraints</h2><p>As projects grow, maintaining consistency across dependencies becomes challenging. Enforcing strict rules around dependencies, Node versions, and other configurations is essential to avoid unnecessary technical debt. Yarn Constraints offer a way to automate these validations.</p><h3>Understanding Yarn Constraints</h3><p>Yarn Constraints are the set of rules for packages in your monorepo. Significant advantage of using them is that you are the manager of these rules. For example, you can create a rule to force all the packages to use the same React version. Once it’s set, you’ll never run into a problem when a host application cannot use a feature/lib with a higher React version.</p><p>While migrating a large monorepo to a new major version of a dependency might be complex, using constraints ultimately brings consistency and stability to the entire project.</p><p>In our example repository, we use a <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/blob/main/yarn.config.cjs\">yarn.config.cjs</a> file to enforce consistency for:</p><ul></ul><p>To allow for flexibility during transitions, you can define exclusions to temporarily bypass certain checks. For instance:</p><pre><code>const workspaceCheckExclusions = [];\nconst dependencyCheckExclusions = [];\n</code></pre><p>These constants let you exclude specific workspaces or dependencies from the validation process, ensuring smooth migrations when necessary.</p><h2>Managing Versioning with Changesets</h2><p>Another problem you may face with the growth of the repository is the version management and releasing. Changesets provide an elegant solution to automate this process, ensuring that every change is tracked, versioned and released.</p><h3>Introduction to Changesets</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/changesets/changesets\">Changesets</a> is an open-source tool designed to manage versioning in monorepo repositories. It simplifies the process of keeping track of changes by allocating them into small, human-readable documents that capture the intent of the change. These documents are called changesets. Key benefits include:</p><ul><li><p>Each changeset outlines the changes made, which helps both developers and consumers understand what to expect in a new release.</p></li><li><p>Each package is versioned independently, ensuring that only the affected packages are updated. This minimizes risk of empty version bumps and dependency breaks.</p></li><li><p>As every change is recorded through a changeset, teams can review and approve updates before the actual release.</p></li></ul><p>One of the most powerful features of Changesets is the ability to automate the process. You can integrate Changesets into your CI/CD pipeline and forget about manual version changes and NPM publishing.</p><p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml\">release.yaml</a> workflow in the example repository. It has <code>create-release-pull-request-or-publish</code> step. The step backed by <a href=\"https://github.com/changesets/action\">changesets/action</a> GitHub action creates all the magic. You only need to set up  for publishing your packages. Then, every push to the  branch will:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check if there are any Changeset documents</strong>.</p><p>If changeset documents are present, the action creates a pull request with the necessary version bumps and changelog updates. If no changes are detected, nothing happens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check if there are any packages ready to publish</strong>.</p><p>If packages are ready to be released, the action publishes the new versions to NPM using the provided . If there are no packages ready to publish, the action exits without making changes.</p></li></ul><p>By automating these tasks, Changesets ensure that your releases are consistent and reliable, reducing the potential for human error and streamlining your development workflow.</p><h2>Workflow Integration with GitHub Actions</h2><p>This section delves into how to unleash the power of the architecture we’ve just built. Using GitHub Actions, we’ll automate PR quality checks, version releases for libraries and features, and application deployments. The focus is on maximizing automation while maintaining code quality and job granularity.</p><p>To ensure that pull request code remains consistent and stable, we create a dedicated <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/blob/main/.github/workflows/quality.yaml\">quality.yaml</a> workflow. This workflow performs several tasks, such as ensuring that manual version changes aren’t introduced (since versioning is managed by Changesets):</p><pre><code>      - id: check_version\n        name: Check version changes\n        run: |\n          BASE_BRANCH=${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}\n          git fetch origin $BASE_BRANCH\n\n          CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/$BASE_BRANCH HEAD)\n          VERSION_CHANGED=false\n          for FILE in $CHANGED_FILES; do\n            if [[ $FILE == */package.json ]]; then\n              if [ -f \"$FILE\" ]; then\n                HEAD_VERSION=$(grep '\"version\":' \"$FILE\" | awk -F '\"' '{print $4}')\n              else\n                continue\n              fi\n\n              HEAD_VERSION=$(cat $FILE | grep '\"version\":' | awk -F '\"' '{print $4}')\n\n              if git cat-file -e origin/$BASE_BRANCH:$FILE 2&gt;/dev/null; then\n                BASE_VERSION=$(git show origin/$BASE_BRANCH:$FILE | grep '\"version\":' | awk -F '\"' '{print $4}')\n              else\n                BASE_VERSION=$HEAD_VERSION\n              fi\n\n              if [ \"$BASE_VERSION\" != \"$HEAD_VERSION\" ]; then\n                VERSION_CHANGED=true\n                echo \"Version change detected in $FILE\"\n              fi\n            fi\n          done\n\n          if [ \"$VERSION_CHANGED\" = true ]; then\n            echo \"Manual version changes are prohibited.

Successful completion of these jobs signals the pull request is ready to merge (in addition to receiving code reviews).</p><p>If additional checks are required for your project, you can update your  and quality script keeping the workflow unchanged.</p><h3>Publish Libraries and Features</h3><p>After a PR is merged, the release workflow (as described in the Changesets chapter) is triggered. This workflow builds the affected packages and creates a PR with the version bumps. Once this PR is approved and merged, <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml\">release.yaml</a> runs again - this time, instead of creating a PR, it detects version changes and releases the updated packages to NPM:</p><pre><code>      - id: build-packages\n        name: Build packages\n        run: yarn build:affected\n\n      - id: create-release-pull-request-or-publish\n        name: Create Release Pull Request or Publish to NPM\n        uses: changesets/action@v1\n        with:\n          version: yarn changeset version\n          publish: yarn release\n          commit: \"chore: publish new release\"\n          title: \"chore: publish new release\"\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}\n\n  release-apps:\n    needs: release-libs-features\n    uses: ./.github/workflows/release-apps.yaml\n    with:\n      publishedPackages: ${{ needs.release-libs-features.outputs.publishedPackages }}\n</code></pre><p>Following this, a job called  is executed, which is responsible for application deployments. It receives a list of published packages from the previous step and brings us to the next chapter.</p><p>The final part of the release process involves deploying your applications (applications are not published to NPM, because they are set  in ). The <a href=\"https://app.hackernoon.com/mobile/MTzydEu1TgZobAMKsJbn\">release-apps.yaml</a> workflow is automatically triggered by <a href=\"https://github.com/teimurjan/robust-monorepo-yarn-nx-changesets/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml\">release.yaml</a>, or can be executed directly from the Actions tab on GitHub:</p><pre><code>name: Release Apps\n\non:\n  workflow_call:\n    inputs:\n      publishedPackages:\n        description: \"List of published packages\"\n        required: false\n        type: string\n        default: \"[]\"\n\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      publishedPackages:\n        description: \"List of published packages (optional)\"\n        required: false\n        type: string\n        default: \"[]\"\n</code></pre><p>This workflow accepts  input to determine which packages have been published. Using a matrix strategy, it checks each application of the matrix for the presence of published dependencies:</p><pre><code>      - id: check-dependency-published\n        name: Check if any app dependency is published\n        run: |\n          PUBLISHED_PACKAGES=\"${{ inputs.publishedPackages }}\"\n          PACKAGE_NAME=\"${{ matrix.package }}\"\n          APP=\"${{ matrix.app }}\"\n\n          DEPENDENCIES=$(jq -r '.dependencies // {} | keys[]' \"apps/$APP/package.json\")\n\n          for DEP in $DEPENDENCIES; do\n            if echo \"$PUBLISHED_PACKAGES\" | grep -w \"$DEP\"; then\n              echo \"published=true\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n              exit 0\n            fi\n          done\n\n          echo \"published=false\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n</code></pre><p>This check is one condition for initiating an app deployment. The other condition ensures that the app’s version has been changed (indicating that a redeploy is necessary even if no dependencies have been updated):</p><pre><code>      - id: check-version-change\n        name: Check if app version has changed\n        run: |\n          APP=\"${{ matrix.app }}\"\n          PACKAGE_JSON_PATH=\"apps/$APP/package.json\"\n          CURRENT_VERSION=$(jq -r '.version' \"$PACKAGE_JSON_PATH\")\n          PREVIOUS_VERSION=$(git show HEAD~1:\"$PACKAGE_JSON_PATH\" | jq -r '.version' || echo \"\")\n\n          if [[ \"$CURRENT_VERSION\" == \"$PREVIOUS_VERSION\" ]]; then\n            echo \"changed=false\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          else\n            echo \"changed=true\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          fi\n</code></pre><p>Finally, after confirming that the app either has updated dependencies or its version has changed, the workflow retrieves the new version and proceeds to build and deploy the application:</p><pre><code>      - id: set-up-docker\n        name: Set up Docker Buildx\n        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3\n\n      - id: get-app-version\n        name: Get the app version from package.json\n        run: echo \"app-version=$(cat ./apps/${{ matrix.app }}/package.json | jq -r '.version')\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - id: build-image\n        name: Build image\n        if: steps.check-dependency-published.outputs.published == 'true' || steps.check-version-change.outputs.changed == 'true'\n        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4\n        with:\n          build-contexts: |\n            workspace=./\n          context: \"./apps/${{ matrix.app }}\"\n          load: true\n          push: false\n          tags: |\n            ${{ matrix.app }}:v${{ steps.get-app-version.outputs.app-version }}\n</code></pre><p>In this example, we build the Docker image without pushing it to a registry. In your production workflow, replace this step with the actual deployment process.</p><p>Throughout this article, we explored setup of a robust monorepo and the tools that help manage it efficiently. By centralizing your codebase, you not only simplify dependency management but also streamlines collaboration across teams. We demonstrated how Yarn can be leveraged to share dependencies, accelerate installation with PnP and improve overall project consistency. Additionally, integrating NX for targeted script execution ensures that CI is fast and efficient. Changesets helped to automate versioning, reducing manual errors and streamlining releases. Finally, we’ve made a production-ready CI/CD pipeline with GitHub actions that performs only the necessary tasks.</p><ol><li>: Begin by setting up a small-scale monorepo to test these best practices.

If you remember the image published then, one thing should be striking — it's not very symmetrical. If you think about viewing a spinning object, then you'd expect to see something with a \"mirror\" symmetry plane where we would see the rotation axis (if someone had marked it). If anything, that published image has three bright spots on a fainter ring. And the spots are not even approximately the same brightness.\n\n This paper suggests that the image we see is the result of the light (radio waves) from SGR-A* being \"lensed\" by another black hole, near (but not quite on) the line of sight between SGR-A* and us. By various modelling approaches, they then refine this idea to a \"best-fit\" of a black hole with mass around 1000 times the Sun, orbiting between the distance of the closest-observed star to SGR-A* (\"S2\" — most imaginative name, ever!), and around 10 times that distance. That's far enough to make a strong interaction with \"S2\" unlikely within the lifetime of S2 before it's accretion onto SGR-A*.)\n\n The region around SGR-A* is crowded. Within 25 parsecs (~80 light years, the distance to Regulus [in the constellation Leo] or Merak [in the Great Bear]) there is around 4 times more mass in several millions of \"normal\" stars than in the SGR-A* black hole. Finding a large (not \"super massive\") black hole in such a concentration of matter shouldn't surprise anyone.\n\n This proposed black hole is larger than anything which has been detected by gravitational waves (yet) ; but not immensely larger — only a factor of 15 or so. (The authors also anticipate the \"what about these big black holes spiralling together?\" question : quote \"and the amplitude of gravitational waves generated by the binary black holes is negligible.\")\n\n Being so close to SGR-A*, the proposed black hole is likely to be moving rapidly across our line of sight. At the distance of \"S2\" it's orbital period would be around 26 years (but the \"new\" black hole is probably further out than than that). Which might be an explanation for some of the variability and \"flickering\" reported for SGR-A* ever since it's discovery.\n As always, more observations are needed. Which, for SGR-A* are frequently being taken, so improving (or ruling out) this explanation should happen fairly quickly. But it's a very interesting, and fun, idea.","contentLength":2719,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"DNA testing company 23andMe files for bankruptcy protection, CEO resigns","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/dna-testing-company-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-resigns/","date":1742799061,"author":"Ivan Mehta","guid":12718,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Genetics testing company 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. to initiate the sale of its assets.

In our experiments, we applied the SA-DRO algorithm to the DDP-based KDE fair learning algorithm proposed by [11], and RFI proposed by [13]. We kept the fairness regularization penalty coefficient to be λ = 0.9. The DRO regularization coefficient can take over the range [0, 1], in this table, we set ϵ = 0.9 for SA-DRO case. In these figures 4, we applied the SA-DRO algorithm to the DDP-based KDE fair learning algorithm by [11], and RFI by [13]. We kept the fairness regularization penalty coefficient to be λ = 0.9. The DRO regularization coefficient can take over the range [0, 1].</p><p>\\\nAs Table 1 shows, we observed that the proposed SA-DRO reduces the tendency of the fair learning algorithm toward the majority sensitive attribute, and the resulting negative prediction rates conditioned to sensitive attribute outcomes became closer to the midpoint between the majority and minority conditional accuracies. On the other hand, the SA-DRO-based algorithms still achieve a low DDP value while the accuracy drop is less than 1%. Moreover, we visualize the prediction shifting in Figure 4 by applying the SA-DRO algorithm to the DDP-based KDE fair learning algorithm by [11], and RFI by [13].

The DRO regularization coefficient takes over the range [0, 1].</p><h2>6.3 DP-based Fair Classification in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</h2><p>To numerically show the implications of the inductive biases of DP-based fair learning algorithms, we simulated a heterogeneous federated learning setting with multiple clients where the sensitive attribute has different distributions across clients. To do this, we split the Adult dataset into 4 subsets of 3k samples to be distributed among 4 clients in the federated learning. While 80% of the training data in Client 1 (minority subgroup in the network) had Female as sensitive attribute, only 20% of Clients 2-4 were female samples. We used the same male/female data proportion to assign 750 test samples to the clients.</p><p>\\\nFor the baseline federated learning method with no fairness regularization, we utilized the FedAvg algorithm [29]. For the DP-based fair federated learning algorithms, we attempted the DDP-based KDE and FACL algorithms which result in single-level optimization problem and hence can be optimized in a distributed learning problem by averaging as in FedAvg. We refer to the extended federated learning version of these algorithms as FedKDE and FedFACL. We also tested our SA-DRO implementations of FedKDE and FedFACL, as well as the localized ERM, KDE, FACL models where each client trained a separate model only on her own data.</p><p>\\\nAs our numerical results in Table 2 and Table 3 indicate, the inductive biases of DP-based federated learning could considerably lower the accuracy of Client 1 with a different majority sensitive attribute compared to the other clients. The accuracy drop led to a lower accuracy compared to Client 1’s locally fair trained model without any collaboration with the other clients, which may affect the client’s incentive to participate in the federated learning process. On the other hand, the SA-DRO implementations of the KDE and FACL methods achieved a better accuracy than Client 1’s local model while preserving the accuracy for the majority clients.</p><p>(1) Haoyu LEI, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (hylei22@cse.cuhk.edu.hk);</p><p>(2) Amin Gohari, Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (agohari@ie.cuhk.edu.hk);</p><p>(3) Farzan Farnia, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (farnia@cse.cuhk.edu.hk).</p>","contentLength":3894,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to Test for AI Fairness","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-test-for-ai-fairness?source=rss","date":1742795651,"author":"Demographic","guid":12752,"unread":true,"content":"<p>.

While the demographic parity (DP) notion has been frequently used to measure a model’s fairness in training fair classifiers, several studies in the literature suggest potential impacts of enforcing DP in fair learning algorithms. In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based regularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label given the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training dataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding the majority of training data. To control such inductive biases in DP-based fair learning, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust optimization (SA-DRO) method improving robustness against the marginal distribution of the sensitive attribute. Finally, we present several numerical results on the application of DP-based learning methods to standard centralized and distributed learning problems. The empirical findings support our theoretical results on the inductive biases in DP-based fair learning algorithms and the debiasing effects of the proposed SA-DRO method.</p><p>A responsible deployment of modern machine learning frameworks in high-stake decision-making tasks requires mechanisms for controlling the dependence of their output on sensitive attributes such as gender and ethnicity. A supervised learning framework with no control on the dependence of the prediction on the input features could lead to discriminatory decisions that significantly correlate with the sensitive attributes. Due to the critical importance of the fairness factor in several machine learning applications, the study and development of fair statistical learning algorithms have received great attention in the literature.</p><p>\\\nTo reduce the biases of DP-based learning algorithms, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust optimization (SA-DRO) method where the fair learner minimizes the worst-case DP-regularized loss over a set of sensitive attribute marginal distributions centered around the data-based marginal distribution. As a result, the SA-DRO approach can account for different frequencies of the sensitive attribute outcomes and thus offer a robust behavior to the changes in the sensitive attribute’s majority outcome.</p><p>\\\nWe present the results of several numerical experiments on the potential biases of DDP-based fair classification methodologies to the sensitive attribute possessing the majority in the dataset. Our empirical findings are consistent with the theoretical results, suggesting the inductive biases of DP-based fair classification rules toward the sensitive attribute-based majority group. On the other hand, our results indicate that the DRO-SA-based fair learning method results in fair classification rules with a lower bias toward the label distribution under the majority sensitive attribute.</p><p>\\\nFurthermore, to show the impacts of such inductive biases in practice, we analyze the fair classification task in a federated learning context where multiple clients attempt to train a decentralized model. We focus on a setting with heterogeneous sensitive attribute distributions across clients where the clients’ majority sensitive attribute outcome may not agree. Figure 1 illustrates such a federated learning scenario over the Adult dataset, where Client 1’s majority sensitive attribute (female samples) is different from the network’s majority group (male samples), and consequently, Client 1’s test accuracy with a DP-based fair federated learning is significantly lower than the test accuracy of a localized fair model trained only on Client 1’s data. Such numerical results question the client’s incentive in participating in fair federated learning. The following is a summary of this work’s main contributions:</p><p>\\\n• Analytically studying the biases of DP-based fair learning toward the majority sensitive attribute,</p><p>\\\n• Proposing a distributionally robust optimization method to lower the biases of DP-based fair classification,</p><p>\\\n• Providing numerical results on the biases of DP-based fair learning in centralized and federated learning scenarios.</p><p><strong>Fairness Violation Metrics.</strong> In this work, we focus on the learning frameworks aiming toward demographic parity (DP). Since enforcing DP to strictly hold could be costly and damaging to the learner’s performance, the machine learning literature has proposed applying several metrics assessing the dependence between random variables, including: the mutual information: [3–7], Pearson correlation [8, 9], kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy: [10], kernel density estimation of the difference of demographic parity (DDP) measures [11], the maximal correlation [12–15], and the exponential Renyi mutual information [16]. In our analysis, we mostly focus on a DDP-based fair regularization scheme, while we show only weaker versions of the inductive biases could further hold in the case of mutual information and maximal correlation-based fair learning algorithms.</p><p>\\\n\\\n<strong>Fair Classification Algorithms.</strong> Fair machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main categories: pre-processing, post-processing, and in-processing. Pre-processing algorithms [17–19] transform biased data features into a new space where labels and sensitive attributes are statistically independent. Post-processing methods such as [2, 20] aim to alleviate the discriminatory impact of a classifier by modifying its ultimate decision. The focus of our work focus is only on in-processing approaches regularizing the training process toward DP-based fair models. Also, [21–23] propose distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for fair classification; however, unlike our method, these works do not apply DRO on the sensitive attribute distribution to reduce the biases.</p><p>(1) Haoyu LEI, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (hylei22@cse.cuhk.edu.hk);</p><p>(2) Amin Gohari, Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (agohari@ie.cuhk.edu.hk);</p><p>(3) Farzan Farnia, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (farnia@cse.cuhk.edu.hk).</p>","contentLength":6440,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"'Fish Doorbell' Enters Fifth Year with Millions of Fans","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/03/23/1958239/fish-doorbell-enters-fifth-year-with-millions-of-fans?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742787840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":12315,"unread":true,"content":"Long-time Slashdot reader invisik reminds us that the \"fish doorbell\" is still going strong, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Now in its fifth year, the site has attracted millions of viewers from around the world with its quirky mix of slow TV and ecological activism.\"\n\nThe central Dutch city of Utrecht installed a \"fish doorbell\" on a river lock that lets viewers of an online livestream alert authorities to fish being held up as they make their springtime migration to shallow spawning grounds.

Antibodies and other players in the immune system may buffer the worst consequences of bird flu, at least to some degree. \"There's certainly preexisting immunity,\" says Florian Krammer, a virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine who is involved in some of the new studies. \"That's very likely not going to protect us as a population from a new pandemic, but it might give us some protection against severe disease.\" This protection is based on shared traits between bird flu and types of seasonal flu that have circulated among us. Certain segments of the population, namely older people, may be particularly well-primed because of flu infections during early childhood. \n\nOf course, there are caveats. \"While this is a bit of a silver lining, it doesn't mean we should all feel safe,\" says Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University's School of Medicine whose lab is probing this question. For one thing, the studies can't be done on people. The conclusions are based on animal models and blood tests that measure the immune response. And how this holds up for an individual is expected to vary considerably, depending on their own immune history, underlying health conditions and other factors. But for now, influenza researchers speculate this may be one reason most people who've caught bird flu over the past year have not fallen severely ill.... \nResearch published this month is encouraging. By analyzing blood samples from close to 160 people, a team at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago were able to show that people born roughly before 1965 had higher levels of antibodies — proteins that bind to parts of the virus — which cross-react to the current strain of bird flu. \n\nThis week U.S. federal officials also \"announced funding for avian influenza research projects, including money for new vaccine projects and potential treatments,\" the Guardian report. The head of America's agriculture department said it would invest $100 million, as part of a larger $1 billion initiative to fight bird flu and stop rising egg prices, according to the nonprofit news site Iowa Capital Dispatch.","contentLength":2322,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt’s new robotics startup reportedly raises another $150M","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/former-cruise-ceo-kyle-vogts-new-robotics-startup-reportedly-raises-another-150m/","date":1742771713,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","guid":12289,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Bot Company, the robotics startup founded by former Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, has raised $150 million in a round led by Greenoaks, according to Reuters, citing unnamed sources.

And now \"Higher education institutions in the Netherlands have been looking for an alternative,\" according to DUB (an independent news site for the Utrecht University community):\n\nEmployees of the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences (HU) were recently advised to switch to Signal. Avans University of Applied Sciences has also been discussing a switch...The National Student Union is concerned about privacy. The subject was raised at last week's general meeting, as reported by chair Abdelkader Karbache, who said: \"Our local unions want to switch to Signal or other open-source software.\" \n\nBesides being open source, Signal is a non-commercial nonprofit, the article points out — though its proponents suggest there's another big difference. \"HU argues that Signal keeps users' data private, unlike WhatsApp.\" Cybernews.com explains the concern:\n\nIn an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Meredith Whittaker [president of the Signal Foundation] discussed the pitfalls of WhatsApp. \"WhatsApp collects metadata: who you send messages to, when, and how often. That's incredibly sensitive information,\" she says.... The only information [Signal] collects is the date an account was registered, the time when an account was last active, and hashed phone numbers... Information like profile name and the people a user communicates with is all encrypted... Metadata might sound harmless, but it couldn't be further from the truth. According to Whittaker, metadata is deadly. \"As a former CIA director once said: 'We kill people based on metadata'.\" \n\nWhatsApp's metadata also includes IP addresses, TechRadar noted last May:\n\n\n\nOther identifiable data such as your network details, the browser you use, ISP, and other identifiers linked to other Meta products (like Instagram and Facebook) associated with the same device or account are also collected... [Y]our IP can be used to track down your location.

(I say this as chair of the standard's working group.) The nickname for P7012 is MyTerms (much as the nickname for the IEEE's 802.11 standard is Wi-Fi). \n\nThe idea behind MyTerms is that the sites and services of the world should agree to your terms, rather than the other way around. \n\n\n\nBasically your web browser proffers whatever agreement you've chosen (from a canonical list hosted at Customer Commons) to the web sites and other online services that you're visiting.\n \n\n\"Browser makers can build something into their product, or any developer can make a browser add-on or extension...\" Searls writes. \"On the site's side — the second-party side — CMS makers can build something in, or any developer can make a plug-in (WordPress) or a module (Drupal). Mobile app toolmakers can also come up with something (or many things)...\"\n\n\n\nMyTerms creates a new regime for privacy: one based on contract. With each MyTerm you are the first party. Not the website, the service, or the app maker. They are the second party. And terms can be friendly. For example, a prototype term called NoStalking says \"Just show me ads not based on tracking me.\" This is good for you, because you don't get tracked, and good for the site because it leaves open the advertising option. NoStalking lives at Customer Commons, much as personal copyrights live at Creative Commons. (Yes, the former is modeled on the latter.) \n\"[L]et's make this happen and show the world what agency really means,\" Searls concludes. \n\nAnother way to say it is they've created \"a draft standard for machine-readable personal privacy terms.\" But Searl's article used a grander metaphor to explain its significance:\nWhen Archimedes said 'Give me a place to stand and I can move the world,' he was talking about agency. You have no agency on the Web if you are always the second party, agreeing to terms and policies set by websites. \n\nYou are Archimedes if you are the first party, setting your own terms and policies. The scale you get with those is One 2 World. The place you stand is on the Web itself — and the Internet below it. \n\nBoth were designed to make each of us an Archimedes.","contentLength":2666,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Solidity Is to Ethereum What Tact Is to TON — How to Build a Voting Smart Contract on TON Using Tact","url":"https://hackernoon.com/solidity-is-to-ethereum-what-tact-is-to-ton-how-to-build-a-voting-smart-contract-on-ton-using-tact?source=rss","date":1742756416,"author":"Favour Kelvin","guid":12302,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Most times, when people start learning how to write smart contracts, the first thing they hear about is Solidity and Ethereum. That was the first thing I heard about too. It's what most tutorials focus on, and for good reason. Solidity made it possible to write programs that live on a blockchain, and Ethereum became the place where many people got started.</p><p>\\\n<em>But Solidity isn’t the only smart contract language out there. And Ethereum isn’t the only blockchain that supports decentralized applications.</em></p><p>\\\nThere’s also , short for . It was created by Telegram, but it's now a public, community-driven chain. It’s fast, lightweight, and handles things a bit differently from what you might be used to on Ethereum. That includes how smart contracts are written.  When I started exploring the TON documentation, I came across four different languages for writing smart contracts: <strong>Tact, Tolk, FunC, and Fift</strong>. I won’t go deep into all four here.</p><p>\\\nThis guide focuses on the Tact language, and we’ll see how to use it to build a basic voting contract that lets users cast votes and check results on-chain.</p><h2>Why I Decided to Learn Tact First</h2><p>The TON ecosystem actually supports multiple languages, each serving different use cases, levels of abstraction, and developer experience. Here’s a quick overview of the of each of them:</p><ul><li> is the traditional language for writing TON smart contracts. It’s low-level and gives you precise control over how your contract works under the hood. It’s powerful, but it also means you’ll need to understand how the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) works, including concepts like stack manipulation, memory layout, and deterministic execution. The syntax is somewhat similar to C, which can feel unfamiliar if you haven’t worked with that style of language before.</li><li> is typically used alongside FunC. It’s a stack-based language that’s mostly used for interacting with the TVM directly and used for  deploying, debugging, and performing on-chain calculations. It’s not usually the language you start with for writing full smart contracts, but it’s important in the overall development workflow on TON.</li><li> is a newer addition that’s still evolving. From what I’ve gathered, it aims to improve tooling and compatibility with higher-level languages. It’s promising, but not yet as widely adopted or documented.</li><li> is a high-level language that’s designed specifically to make TON smart contract development more accessible and developer friendly. Tact simplifies a lot of the lower-level complexity and lets you focus on writing your logic in a clean, readable way. The syntax is closer to what you’d see in TypeScript or Solidity, which makes it much easier to get started without needing to dive deep into TVM internals.</li></ul><p>\\\nTact provides and a quicker path for building and deploying contracts on the TON blockchain.</p><h2>Understanding How Tact Works</h2><p>Before we start writing code, it’s important to understand how Tact smart contracts are structured. A typical Tact contract includes a few core components:</p><ul><li><p> block – This is where you define the name of your contract and declare any state variables.</p></li><li><p> block –  It initializes your contract’s state variables and sets the contract’s starting conditions. This block runs once at the time of deployment.</p></li><li><p> blocks – These are like event listeners. They handle incoming messages and define how your contract reacts to them.</p></li><li><p>Getter functions () – These are optional read-only functions that allow users or other contracts to query the contract’s state without changing it.</p></li></ul><p>Tact uses message-based communication, which is how all interactions on TON work. Each contract receives a message and processes it in its own  block.  This message-based structure helps organize your contract logic in a modular, maintainable way.</p><p>\\\nLet’s now apply this in a real example by building a simple voting contract.</p><h2>Building Your First Voting Contract with Tact (Using the TON Web IDE)</h2><p>In this section, we'll walk through how to implement a basic voting system using Tact. This voting contract will allows users to vote for predefined candidates and tracks the total number of votes each candidate receives.</p><p>\\\nWe’ll be doing everything inside the TON Web IDE, which is an in-browser tool where you can write, build, and test your contracts without installing anything locally.</p><h3>Step 1 – Open the TON Web IDE</h3><ul><li>Click . In the popup:</li><li>Make sure the language is on .</li><li>Choose  as your template.</li><li>Name your project something like .</li></ul><h3>Step 2 – Writing the Voting Contract Code</h3><p>After creating your project, open the  file. You’ll see a boilerplate setup:</p><pre><code>// Import the Deployable trait so the contract can be deployed easily\nimport \"@stdlib/deploy\";\n\ncontract BlankContract with Deployable {\n    init() {\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><ul><li> is required for deployment to work and should not be removed from the code.</li><li> is the placeholder name.</li><li>The  block runs only once when the contract is deployed and is used to initialize state variables.</li></ul><p>\\\nNow, let’s map out our own code.</p><p>\\\nFirst, we’ll define the message structure for voting:</p><pre><code>// Import the Deployable trait so the contract can be deployed easily\nimport \"@stdlib/deploy\";\n\n// Define a message structure for voting\nmessage Vote {\n    candidate: Int as uint32; // 1 = Alice, 2 = Bob\n}\n</code></pre><p>This is the Vote message. When someone wants to vote, they’ll send a message to the contract that includes a number:</p><p>Tact uses this structure to process the incoming vote and decide which candidate gets the point.</p><p>\\\nNext, we’ll set up our contract and add two state variables to keep track of each candidate’s votes:</p><pre><code>...\ncontract VotingContract with Deployable {\n\n    // State variables to track votes\n    votesAlice: Int as uint32;\n    votesBob: Int as uint32;\n</code></pre><p>Inside the contract, we defined two variables:</p><ul><li>: stores the number of votes Alice receives.</li><li>: stores the number of votes Bob receives.</li></ul><p>\\\nWe’ll now initialize those vote counts to zero inside the  block to set the starting state of the contract when it's first deployed.</p><pre><code>    init() {\n        self.votesAlice = 0;\n        self.votesBob = 0;\n    }\n</code></pre><p>The  block runs , right when the contract is deployed and it sets both vote counts to zero.</p><p>\\\nNow comes the logic. When a vote is sent, we want the contract to check who the vote is for and increase the correct vote count.</p><pre><code>    // Handle vote messages\n    receive(msg: Vote) {\n        if (msg.candidate == 1) {\n            self.votesAlice += 1;\n        } else if (msg.candidate == 2) {\n            self.votesBob += 1;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre><p>So when a vote is received:</p><ul><li>If  is 1, we add +1 to </li><li>If  is 2, we add +1 to </li></ul><p>\\\nFinally, we’ll create getter functions to let anyone query the vote count for each candidate without changing the contract state.</p><pre><code>    // Getter for Alice's votes\n    get fun getVotesForAlice(): Int {\n        return self.votesAlice;\n    }\n\n    // Getter for Bob's votes\n    get fun getVotesForBob(): Int {\n        return self.votesBob;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>These two getter functions let us check the number of votes each candidate has received without modifying anything in the contract. It’s a read-only operation.</p><p>\\\nBelow is the full voting contract code:</p><pre><code>import \"@stdlib/deploy\";\n\n// Define a message structure for voting\nmessage Vote {\n    candidate: Int as uint32; // 1 = Alice, 2 = Bob\n}\n\ncontract VotingContract with Deployable {\n\n    // State variables to track votes\n    votesAlice: Int as uint32;\n    votesBob: Int as uint32;\n\n    init() {\n        self.votesAlice = 0;\n        self.votesBob = 0;\n    }\n\n    // Handle vote messages\n    receive(msg: Vote) {\n        if (msg.candidate == 1) {\n            self.votesAlice += 1;\n        } else if (msg.candidate == 2) {\n            self.votesBob += 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Getter for Alice's votes\n    get fun getVotesForAlice(): Int {\n        return self.votesAlice;\n    }\n\n    // Getter for Bob's votes\n    get fun getVotesForBob(): Int {\n        return self.votesBob;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h3>Step 4 – Build and Deploy the Contract</h3><ul><li><p>On the left sidebar, click on </p></li><li><p>Under , make sure  is selected.</p></li><li><p>Make sure  is selected and click . This will compile your contract and check for any syntax errors or issues in your code.</p></li><li><p>Next, make sure  is selected in the dropdown as that’s your actual contract, not the default placeholder. If you don’t see it, press  to save your file so the IDE can detect the updated contract.</p></li><li><p>Then click . If everything works correctly, you’ll see a confirmation message in the logs showing that your contract was successfully deployed on Sandbox.</p></li></ul><h3>Step 5 – Interact With the Contract</h3><p>Once deployed, scroll down and you’ll see two sections:</p><ul><li><p>, </p></li></ul><p> In the  section, enter  in the  input field and click  You’ve just voted for Alice! You can repeat this to cast more votes.</p><p>\\\n: Click  under  and check the  panel to see the vote count</p><ul><li><p>Do the same for Bob by sending  in the  field, then check </p></li></ul><p>In my test run, I voted for Alice  and Bob , and the getter functions showed exactly that.</p><h2>💭 Final Thoughts: Keep Building, Keep Exploring</h2><p><strong>🙌 Congrats if you read all the way through!</strong></p><p>\\\nNow that you’ve seen how a simple voting contract works in Tact, you’ve taken your first step into smart contract development on TON.

Sourced by the entire web, Knowledge Graph lets you perform complex queries against billions of data points instantly via a simple API. I decided to take a spin with their API and build a \"relatively\" simple tool - news analysis for a product run in on automated platform. Should be easy, right? Let's get to it. Note that the examples in this blog post assume you've gotten a <a href=\"https://app.diffbot.com/get-started\">free key</a> from Diffbot. Be sure to do that before trying the samples.</p><p>Before writing a line of code, I signed into Diffbot and opened up their visual search tool for Knowledge Graph. The tool lets you build queries visually or by hand. Queries are known as 'DQL' statements in Diffbot and are pretty simple to read even if you've never seen the syntax before.</p><p>\\\nFrom this tool, I started off by selecting an entity type. This is the high level type of data I want to search and can be one of many numerous options, from people to events to movies and investments. I selected \"Article\" as my intent is to find news that's speaking ill of my wonderful product. I then selected a \"Filter By\" option. While you can filter by any property in the entity type, I used  as it's a more precise match than a simple text search. While a text filter does work, using  gives a much better result by ensuring that the results are focused on my search, not just casually mentioning it. For my demo, I'll be looking for articles about \"XBox\".</p><p>\\\nI also used the \"Sort by\" value to show newest first and this hit search to see if my results made sense.</p><p>\\\nWhile my initial results didn't include any foreign language results, I knew I'd want to filter to results in English, so I next added a filter for language. Hitting the + sign by the current filter, I was then able to add language and  for English. Once again, I hit search:</p><p>\\\nAlright, so next, I want to filter to just negative results. Knowledge Graph Article entities have a sentiment score (you can see them in the search results) that go from -1 to most negative to 1 to most positive. Initially, I simply selected items with a sentiment less than or equal to 0.</p><p>\\\nWoot, getting there. As a final step, I knew this was going to be automated and filtered to 'recent' items, so I added one more filter, this time on , selected , and picked a date from a week ago.</p><p>\\\nAt this point, the query looks good, so let's copy out the query value provided by the tool:</p><pre><code>type:Article tags.label:\"Xbox\" language:\"en\" sentiment&lt;=0 date&gt;\"2025-03-03\" sortBy:date\n</code></pre><p>Designing the query was really the hard part. For the code, I went to the <a href=\"https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/kg-search\">Search</a> docs. The examples are curl/HTTP based but quite easy to port to Python or any other language. Consider this sample:</p><pre><code>import os \nimport requests \nimport json \nimport urllib.parse\n\ntoken = os.environ.get(\"db_token\")\n\nquery = 'type:Article tags.label:\"Xbox\" language:\"en\" sentiment&lt;=0 date&gt;\"2025-03-03\" sortBy:date'\n\napiCall = f\"https://kg.diffbot.com/kg/v3/dql?type=query&amp;token={token}&amp;query={urllib.parse.quote(query)}&amp;size=25\"\n\nreq = requests.get(apiCall)\nresults = json.loads(req.content)\nprint(f\"Total results, {results['hits']}\")\n\nfor result in results[\"data\"]:\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"title\"])\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"date\"][\"str\"])\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"summary\"])\n    if \"author\" in result[\"entity\"]:\n        print(result[\"entity\"][\"author\"])\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"siteName\"])\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"pageUrl\"])\n    print(result[\"entity\"][\"sentiment\"])\n\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n</code></pre><p>\\\nBreaking this down - I began with my query from the visual tool. This then gets url encoded and passed to the API for Knowledge Graph.

I began importing from :</p><pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n</code></pre><p>\\\nI then generated a formatted date for last week:</p><pre><code>today = datetime.now()\nlastWeek = today + timedelta(days=-7)\nfLastWeek = lastWeek.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAnd the last bit was to just include that date in my query:</p><pre><code>query = f'type:Article tags.label:\"Xbox\" language:\"en\" sentiment&lt;=0 date&gt;{fLastWeek} sortBy:date'\n</code></pre><p>\\\nYou can see the complete source code for the initial version <a href=\"https://github.com/cfjedimaster/writing/blob/main/kg_sentiment_analysis/test1.py\">here</a> and the final version <a href=\"https://github.com/cfjedimaster/writing/blob/main/kg_sentiment_analysis/test2.py\">here</a>.</p><p>Alright, time to automate this. For my automation, I'll be making use of <a href=\"https://pipedream.com\">Pipedream</a>, an  flexible workflow system I've used many times in the past. Here's the entire workflow with each part built out:</p><p>\\\nI began my workflow with a simple schedule based trigger, ie, when to run. This was somewhat arbitrary, but I picked weekly, on Sunday, at 1PM.</p><p>\\\nThe next step, , handles the logic I demonstrated earlier, but now in a \"Pipedream handler\", which is the standard way to write code steps in Pipedream workflow.</p><pre><code>import os \nimport requests \nimport json \nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport urllib.parse\n\ndef handler(pd: \"pipedream\"):\n\n  token = os.environ.get(\"db_token\")\n\n  today = datetime.now()\n  lastWeek = today + timedelta(days=-7)\n  fLastWeek = lastWeek.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n  query = f'type:Article tags.label:\"Xbox\" language:\"en\" sentiment&lt;=0 date&gt;{fLastWeek} sortBy:date'\n\n  apiCall = f\"https://kg.diffbot.com/kg/v3/dql?type=query&amp;token={token}&amp;query={urllib.parse.quote(query)}&amp;size=25\"\n\n  req = requests.get(apiCall)\n  return json.loads(req.content)\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe next step is simply a quick code step to end the workflow if no results are found:</p><pre><code>def handler(pd: \"pipedream\"):\n\n    if len(pd.steps[\"getArticles\"][\"$return_value\"][\"data\"]) == 0:\n      pd.flow.exit(\"No results\")\n</code></pre><p>\\\nNow I want to 'massage' the results a bit. I'm going to eventually email this to myself, so I built a step to format the results in a nice string:</p><pre><code>from datetime import datetime\n\ndef handler(pd: \"pipedream\"):\n\n  email = f\"\"\"\nNegative Article Results:\n\nOur search found {pd.steps[\"getArticles\"][\"$return_value\"][\"hits\"]} results. Here are the top 25:\n  \"\"\"  \n\n  for result in pd.steps[\"getArticles\"][\"$return_value\"][\"data\"]:\n    date = datetime.fromtimestamp(result[\"entity\"][\"date\"][\"timestamp\"] / 1000)\n    date_f = date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n    email += f\"\"\"\n{result[\"entity\"][\"title\"]}\nSentiment:  {result[\"entity\"][\"sentiment\"]}\nPublished:  {date_f}\nLink:       {result[\"entity\"][\"pageUrl\"]}\n    \"\"\"\n\n  return email\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAgain, this is somewhat arbitrary in terms of what I thought important enough to include. You could definitely get more fancier, and even do things like, \"on a really bad sentiment, add color, red flags, etc\".</p><p>\\\nThe final step was to simply email myself the results. Pipedream supports a \"send an email to the account owner\" step that will do just that, email me. If I were building this out for a client, I'd use one of the many Pipedream built-in steps for mail APIs.</p><p>\\\nOnce run, I get a nice email with a list of articles and their sentiment:</p><p>This is just one example of using Diffbot's Knowledge Graph API, and as a reminder, articles are only one of the many different types of data you can search. Everything I did here was also done on a , so you can absolutely sign up and try it out yourself.

The arbiter also said that while her publisher Macmillan appeared for the hearing on Meta's motion, Wynn-Williams did not despite having received due notice. The arbiter did not make any assessments about the book's veracity, but Meta spokespeople argued that the ruling meant that \"Sarah Wynn Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.\" \n\n\nWynn-Williams this week filed an emergency motion to overturn the ruling, arguing that she didn't receive proper notice of the arbitration proceedings to the email accounts Meta knows she uses, according to a copy of the motion seen by The Post. Wynn-Williams further alleged that her severance agreement including the non-disparagement provisions are unenforceable, arguing that it violates laws that protect whistleblowers from retaliation, among other points. In a statement, legal representatives for Wynn-Williams said they were \"confident in the legal arguments and look forward to a swift restoration of Ms. Wynn-Williams' right to tell her story.\" \nThat book — Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism — is currently #1 on the New York Times best-seller list (and #3 on Amazon.com's best-selling books list). And the incident prompted an article by Wired editor at large Steven Levy titled \"Meta Tries to Bury a Tell-All Book.\" (\"Please pause for a moment to savor the irony,\" Levy writes. \"Meta, the company that recently announced an end to fact-checking in posts seen by potentially millions of people, is griping that an author didn't fact-check with them?\") \n\nAnd this led to a heated exchange on X.com between the Wired editor at large and Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bozworth: \n\nSteven Levy: Meta probably realizes that all-out war on this book will only help its sales. But they are furious that an insider--who signed an NDA!--is going White Lotus on them, showing what it's like on the inside. \n\nMeta CTO Bozworth: Except that it is full of lies, Steven. Shame on you. \nSteven Levy: Boz, it would be helpful if Meta called out what it believes are the factual inaccuracies, especially in cases where it calls the book \"defamatory.\" \n\nMeta CTO Bozworth: Sorry you don't get to make up a bunch of stories and then put the burden on the person you lied about. Read the accounts from former employees who have gone through several of the anecdotes and said flatly they did not happen as written and then extrapolate. \nSteven Levy: I would love for Sheryl, Mark and Joel to speak out on those anecdotes and give their sides of the story. They are the key subjects of those stories and their direct denial of specific incidents would matter. \n\nMeta CTO Bozworth: Did you read what I wrote? I'm sure you would love to have more fuel for your \"nobody wants you to read this\" headline, but that's a total bullshit expectation. It isn't unreasonable to expect a journalist like you to do basic diligence. I'm sure you have our comms email! \nSteven Levy: Believe me I was in touch with your comms people...","contentLength":3825,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"FSF Holds Live Auction of 'Historically Important' Free Software Memorabilia","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/03/23/1558210/fsf-holds-live-auction-of-historically-important-free-software-memorabilia?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742751240,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":11133,"unread":true,"content":"In 30 minutes the Free Software Foundation holds a live auction of memorabilia to celebrate their upcoming 40th anniversary. \"By moving out of the FSF office, we got to sort through all the fun and historically important memorabilia and selected the best ones,\" they announced earlier — and 25 items will up for bids. (To participate in the live auction, you must register in advance.) \n\n \"This is your chance to get your very own personal souvenir of the FSF,\" explains an 11-page auction booklet, \"from original GNU art to a famous katana and the Internet Hall of Fame medal of the FSF's founder.\"\n\nThat's right... a katana.\n\nOnce upon a time, this 41-inch blade turned heads at the FSF's tech team office. Donated by FSF friends and fans of the XKCD webcomic #225, it became a lighthearted \"weapon\" in the war for user freedom. As RMS himself is anti-violence, he made a silly joke by examining the katana closely instead of brandishing it, symbolizing that software freedom can be defended with wit. In a legendary photo, this was perceived as if he sniffed the blade. Between the etched dragon on the scabbard and the wavy hamon on the blade, it's as flashy as it is symbolic — especially if you like taking on proprietary software with style (and a dash of humor).\n \n\nThe auction is intended \"to entrust some of the historically important free software memorabilia that were in the FSF's office and archive to the free software community instead of locking them away in a storage unit where no one can enjoy them. \n\n\"Hopefully, this way some of these unique items will be displayed in galleries or on the walls of free software enthusiasts. All auction proceeds will go towards the FSF's mission to promote computer user freedom.\" \n\nAnd speaking of user freedom, here's how they described the Internet Hall of Fame medal:\n\n\nWhen Richard M. Stallman, the founder of the FSF, was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame, it was the ultimate nod to free software's immense impact on the Internet... The medal is shiny, and the frame is fancy, but the real radiance is the recognition that the Internet might look much more locked down and dull without those original free software seeds.

The value for k = 1/Lc (with Lc the size of the unit cell) is the periodicity limit. On the other hand, this limit has of course meaning for a continuum model like the relaxed micromorphic model. To reconcile these two limits in the fitting procedure, we will impose that the limit k → ∞ for our continuum model will coincide with the periodicity limit of the Bloch-Floquet curves k = 1/Lc. This strategy allows us to preserve the width of the band-gap, cf.

For the plots here, we only show k(ω) where the expression is real-valued and ignore imaginary k(ω) which arise in the band gap and for higher frequencies. Moreover, we cannot have two distinct wavenumbers with the same frequency which implies that all curves are monotonic. For every group of dispersion curves, e.g. the three pressure waves for 45◦ incidence, each individual curve is bounded by the others. Starting with the acoustic curves, their asymptote must be below the cut-off of the lower optic curve of the same type (pressure or shear) while the asymptote of the lower optic curves is bounded from above by the cut-off of the highest optic curve. In particular, self-intersection between two pressure or two shear curves is not possible with this simplified version of the relaxed micromorphic model.</p><p>\\\nOn the other hand, we observe that for the numerical values from Comsol Multiphysics® the asymptote of the acoustic shear wave at 45◦ should be slightly higher than the cut-off of the lower optic curve with 581.95 Hz and 554.61 Hz, respectively. In addition, assuming that all micro parameters κm, µm, µ∗ m (see Table 6) are larger than their corresponding macro counterparts κM, µM, µ∗ M, we did not manage to generate decreasing dispersion curves as observed for the lower optic pressure wave for an angle of incidence of 45◦ . This effect can instead be achieved when considering mixed space-time derivatives on the micro-distortion tensor P, cf. Section 7.</p><p>\\\nWhen the relative positions of the curves allow to fit the cut-offs and the asymptotes of each curve separately (e.g. for an incidence angle of zero degrees shown here) the simplified version of the relaxed micromorphic model used does indeed shows very good results.

This enriched model allows us to obtain a good overall fitting of the dispersion curves while introducing the new possibility of describing modes with negative group velocity that are known to trigger negative refraction effects. The inertia-augmented model also allows for more freedom on the values of the asymptotes corresponding to the cut-offs. In the previous version of the relaxed micromorphic model, the asymptote of one curve (pressure or shear) is always bounded by the cut-off of the following curve of the same type. This constraint does not hold anymore in the enhanced version of the model. While the obtained curves’ fitting is of good quality overall, a perfect quantitative agreement must still be reached for very small wavelengths that are close to the size of the unit cell.</p><p>Metamaterials are materials whose mechanical properties go beyond those of classical materials thanks to their heterogeneous microstructure. They can show unusual static/dynamic responses such as negative Poisson’s ratio [27], twist or bend in response to being pushed or pulled [18, 36], band-gaps [28, 46, 8, 13], cloaking [11, 31], focusing [20, 16], channeling [24, 45], negative refraction [52, 25, 47], etc. The working frequency of each metamaterial strongly depends on the characteristic size and the geometry of the underlying unit cell, as well as on the choice of the base material. In this paper, we present a labyrinthine metamaterial that, thanks to the use of a polymeric based material and an optimized distribution of mass inside the unit cell (see Figure 1), gives rise to a wide acoustic band-gap with characteristic unit cell’s size of the order of centimeters.</p><p>\\\nThe direct finite element modeling of structures build up with this labyrinthine metamaterial is unfeasible due to the extremely tight meshing that would be needed to correctly cover the narrow strips of material inside each unit cell. It is thus apparent the need for a homogenized model to use this type of very promising metamaterials in actual engineering designs. Various homogenization techniques have been developed with the purpose of providing rigorous predictions of the macroscopic metamaterial’s mechanical response when the properties of the base materials and their spatial distribution are known. These homogenization approaches have been shown to be useful in describing the overall behavior of metamaterials in the static and quasi-static regimes [6, 40, 3, 30, 21, 48, 35, 9, 12, 44, 29, 19, 22] as well as, more recently, in the dynamic regime [5, 14, 10, 15, 4, 23, 49, 50, 51, 42, 41, 43]. However, these models are often unsuited to deal with finitesize metamaterials, because they are based on upscaling techniques valid for unbounded media. Because of that, finite-size metamaterials’ structures are mostly investigated via Finite Element simulations which are performed using directly the microstructured material, e.g. [26]. The downside of this approach is that the computational cost quickly becomes unsustainable (especially for unit cells as the one presented in this paper), although the propagation patterns obtained are very accurate. This heavily limits the possibility of exploring large-scale or very convoluted geometric meta-structures.</p><p>\\\nTo overcome this problem and open up the possibility of designing complex meta-structures using the metamaterial presented in this paper as a basic building block, we propose to use an inertia-augmented relaxed micromorphic model. This model is based on the relaxed micromorphic model that we previously established [34, 32, 17, 1, 2] and has been augmented with a new inertia term accounting for coupled space-time derivatives of the micro-distortion tensor. The relaxed micromorphic model has extensively proven its efficacy in describing the broadband behavior of many infinite and finite-size metamaterials [1, 2, 37, 38, 39] and is extended in this paper so as to be able to account for negative group velocity which was not the case before. We will show that the proposed model is able to describe well the labyrinthine metamaterial’s response for a large range of frequencies (going beyond the first band-gap) and wave numbers (approaching the size of the unit cell) and for all directions of propagation with a limited number of frequency- and scale-independent constitutive parameters. The new inertia-augmented term will be shown to trigger modes with negative group velocities that are known to be associated with negative refraction phenomena. The results presented in this paper will allow us to shortly present new designs of finite-size labyrinthine metamaterials’ structures that can control elastic energy in the acoustic regime for eventual subsequent re-use.</p><p>In this section, we present a new unit cell’s design that gives rise to a metamaterial for acoustic control. This unit cell is designed to achieve a band-gap at relatively low frequencies (600−2000 Hz) so that application for acoustic control can be targeted. The unit cell considered is made out of polyethylene, cf. Table 1. Compared to Aluminium or Titanium, that we used for the metamaterials studied in [37, 38, 39], Polyethylene gives rise to lower wave speeds, thus allowing band-gap phenomena to appear at lower frequencies.</p><p>\\\n\\\nA further lowering of the band-gap is obtained through the adoption of a labyrinth-type geometry, cf. Figure 1. This structure presents a tetragonal symmetry and thus features a reduced number of parameters with respect to a fully anisotropic system. The circular center of the unit cell is connected by thin bars allowing the heavier center to move easily, thus giving rise to local resonance phenomena of relatively low frequencies while additionally providing a very soft macro-material behaviour.</p>","contentLength":6442,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"US Security Agencies Halt Coordinated Effort to Counter Russian Sabotage and Cyberattacks","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/03/22/1824242/us-security-agencies-halt-coordinated-effort-to-counter-russian-sabotage-and-cyberattacks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1742747640,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":11132,"unread":true,"content":"Reuters reported this week that several U.S. national security agencies \"have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks...\"\n\n\nThe plan was led by the president's National Security Council (NSC) and involved at least seven national security agencies working with European allies to disrupt plots targeting Europe and the United States, seven former officials who participated in the working groups told Reuters...

With a background in AI and experience in core machine learning teams at Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, Shashank shares his journey, insights on the challenges of scaling AI, and how Fraction AI is tackling the industry's biggest bottleneck – reliable, high-quality data. Get an inside look into how Fraction AI is disrupting the AI landscape and democratizing AI ownership.</p><p>: Hey Ishan, great to be here. I’m Shashank, founder of Fraction AI. My background is in AI. I studied computer science at IIT Delhi with a focus on AI research. After that, I worked on the core ML team at Goldman Sachs, then joined an early-stage startup as an AI researcher, and later moved to a hedge fund applying AI to quantitative trading.</p><p>\\\nThe problem I kept running into was that AI was becoming centralized. A few companies controlled the most powerful models, and everyone else was stuck using off-the-shelf versions that weren’t tailored to their needs. But AI isn’t one-size-fits-all. A lawyer needs a different model than a trader or a developer. The best AI is specialized, yet training your own was either too expensive or too complex.</p><p>\\\nThat’s why I started Fraction AI. It’s a platform where anyone can own and train their own AI models. Users create AI agents that compete in sessions. Each agent pays a small entry fee, generates the best possible output for a task, and gets judged by an LLM. Winners earn rewards, and their models improve based on their best outputs. Over time, users build highly specialized AIs that keep getting better.</p><p>\\\nInstead of relying on a few big models, we’re creating an ecosystem where thousands of smaller, specialized models compete, learn, and grow. AI shouldn’t just be something you use. It should be something you own and improve. That’s what we’re building.</p><h2>Ishan Pandey: You’ve worked in core ML teams at Microsoft and Goldman Sachs. How did those experiences shape your approach to building Fraction AI?</h2><p>: Yeah, during college, I interned at Microsoft on the Bing team, working on machine learning for search ranking. That was my first real exposure to large-scale AI systems. Search isn’t just about finding information, but understanding what users really want and ranking results effectively. It taught me that AI isn’t just about smart models, it’s about making them work in the real world.</p><p>\\\nAt Goldman Sachs, I was on the core ML team, building models for financial predictions. In finance, even small improvements matter, and models are constantly tested in real-world conditions where mistakes are costly. That experience taught me how to build AI that is reliable, adaptable, and improves over time instead of just performing well in a controlled setting.</p><p>\\\nLater, at a hedge fund, I worked on AI for quant trading. That’s where I saw how powerful competition can be. Models that continuously adapt and learn from competing strategies tend to perform better than those that stay static.</p><p>\\\nAll of that shaped Fraction AI. Instead of building one perfect AI, we created a system where AI agents compete, learn, and improve based on real-world feedback. The best AI isn’t designed in isolation - it evolves by constantly testing itself against others. That’s the idea behind Fraction AI.</p><p>: Yeah I stand strongly by that statement. Current AI models have already seen most of the internet. More compute won’t help if there’s nothing new to learn from. The real challenge is getting fresh, high-quality data. DeepSeek figured this out and trained a model using pure reinforcement learning instead of traditional datasets. They realized you can’t just keep fine-tuning on the same old data, you need a system that generates new, useful information.</p><p>\\\nWe’re taking that idea further with Fraction AI. Instead of relying on static datasets, we let AI agents compete in real-world tasks. The best outputs get judged, refined, and used to improve the next generation of models. It’s decentralized and constantly evolving. AI should belong to everyone, not just a few companies. The best way to make that happen is to create a system where people train and improve their own models by generating new, high-quality data. Instead of AI being locked away, it keeps evolving through real-world use.</p><p> The biggest misconception is that scaling AI is just about throwing more compute at bigger models. That worked in the past, but we’ve hit a wall, more parameters don’t automatically mean better results. The real bottleneck now is data, not compute. Another mistake is thinking AI is static. Many companies fine-tune a model once and assume it’s “done.” But AI isn’t like software, it needs to keep learning from new data to stay relevant. If your AI isn’t continuously improving, it’s falling behind.</p><p>\\\nFraction AI fixes this by making AI self-improving. Instead of training a model once and hoping it works forever, we create a system where AI agents constantly compete, learn from their best outputs, and evolve in real time. It’s not just about scaling models, it’s about scaling learning. The future of AI isn’t about building the biggest model. It’s about creating systems that can grow on their own. That’s what we’re building.</p><p> The biggest challenge was shifting from solving technical problems to running an actual company. In big tech, you focus on building models, but as a founder, you have to think about everything - product, users, funding, and making sure what you build actually matters.</p><p>\\\nI spent a lot of time watching Y Combinator courses to understand how to build and scale a startup. IIT Delhi has a huge entrepreneurship culture, so I had a lot of people to look up to who had already taken the leap. That gave me confidence that it was possible. Becoming a Nailwal Fellow was also a game-changer. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, is one of the most respected guys in Web3, and getting his guidance was incredibly valuable. He understands how to build in an open, decentralized way while still making things work at scale.</p><p>The hardest part of starting a company isn’t the tech, it’s figuring out how to turn your vision into something real, something people actually use. Learning from others who’ve done it before made a huge difference.</p><p>: Fraction AI is built around the idea that AI should improve itself through competition and real-world use. Instead of relying on static datasets, we create a system where AI agents generate, refine, and improve data at scale. Here’s how it works: Users create AI agents, each with its own system prompt and tuning. These agents compete in sessions where they generate outputs for a given task. Their responses are scored by an LLM judge, and the best-performing agents earn rewards. This process repeats continuously, creating a feedback loop where AI models improve over time.</p><p>\\\nBut we don’t just collect data - we fine-tune the models too. The best outputs from these competitions are fed back into the training process, helping agents evolve and specialize. Over multiple sessions, users can upgrade their models, making them smarter and better suited to their specific tasks.</p><p>\\\nThis creates a scalable system for high-quality data collection and model improvement. Instead of relying on pre-existing datasets, AI agents generate fresh, relevant data that’s validated in real-time. The result is an ecosystem where AI isn’t static - it’s always learning, always improving.</p><h2>Ishan Pandey: What advice would you give to AI startups trying to navigate the balance between innovation, sales, and funding?</h2><p> The key is timing. In the early days, focus on innovation and sales at the same time - you need just enough product to prove people want it, but you also have to start selling early. Don’t wait for perfection. If you can’t get someone to pay for it, it’s probably not solving a real problem.</p><p>\\\nOnce you have even a small proof of demand, raise funds as soon as possible. You need to survive long enough to build something great. A lot of startups fail because they focus too much on the product without securing enough runway. Don’t focus too much on dilution at this point, startups are a zero or one game anyways.</p><p>\\\nAfter fundraising, it becomes all about sales and continuous innovation. Keep improving the product while scaling up revenue. If you can keep selling and keep pushing the tech forward, you’ll stay ahead.</p><p>\\\nIn short: Prove demand → Raise fast → Scale sales while improving the product.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong>Vested Interest Disclosure:</strong>&nbsp;This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

With the SEC dropping its long-standing appeal against Ripple, could it finally live up to its potential?</p><p>\\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission first opened its lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020 before XRP reached a low of $0.16 on January 2, 2021. By January 18, 2025, XRP was trading at $2.63, and with the SEC ending its interest in the coin, there’s plenty of optimism for Ripple to rally higher.</p><p>\\\n“Today marks a historic victory—for Ripple, our employees and customers, and for the entire crypto industry,” , Ripple CEO in a statement. “After more than four years of litigation, the SEC will drop its appeal against Ripple, concluding the SEC’s 4+ year long lawsuit. This is subject to Commission vote and approval.”</p><p>\\\nMuch has been made of Ripple’s impressive technical attributes. Notably, its Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm, which validates transactions through designated servers until they reach a supermajority agreement.</p><p>\\\nIt’s this algorithm that’s helped to make Ripple far more functional than other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and has paved the way for transactions to be processed in just three to five seconds while handling up to 1,500 transactions per second.</p><p>\\\nCrucially, it’s this high-speed blockchain network that gives Ripple plenty of potential use cases as cryptocurrency continues its emergence into mainstream adoption.</p><p>\\\nBut could removing the shackles of SEC scrutiny just be the beginning of Ripple’s journey? Let’s take a deeper look at the coin’s prospects for 2025 and beyond:</p><h2>Functionality is Ripple’s USP</h2><p>Not many cryptocurrencies that were launched in 2012 possess blockchains that are flexible enough to transform the fintech landscape, but Ripple is an excellent asset when it comes to fast cross-border payments.</p><p>\\\nWhen institutions use Ripple to make a payment overseas, XRP acts as a  to optimize currency transfers in a fast and low-cost manner. Whether this means performing a direct currency exchange or using XRP as an intermediary, the flexibility Ripple provides can actively help reduce transaction costs without the need for appointing middlemen to handle the task.</p><p>\\\nMany forecasters suggest that cryptocurrency will become  into mainstream usage thanks to more regulatory clarity from the SEC’s new acting director Mark Uyeda, Ripple could be one of the key beneficiaries of the many functional cryptocurrencies throughout the ecosystem.</p><p>\\\nIn fact, LMAX Group recently incorporated XRP into its institutional trading infrastructure, intending to offer institutions  to highly liquid assets throughout markets.</p><p>\\\nLMAX, which provides institutional execution venues for forex and digital assets trading, also acquired FX HedgePool, an institutional swaps matching service, and appears to have highlighted Ripple as an effective resource for boosting efficiency.</p><p>\\\n“Ripple’s utility in lowering transaction costs for international payments makes it a potential leader in financial systems and fintech,” explains Maxim Manturov, head of investment advice at Freedom24. “If Ripple's global partnerships continue to expand, the price of XRP could reach $5-$8.”</p><p>Despite a strong start to 2025 and a flow of good news, XRP is showing signs of strain amid more widespread bearish market sentiment.</p><p>\\\nWorryingly, some  believe that market pressures could push Ripple below $2 if support barriers are retested amid an increasingly volatile outlook for crypto.</p><p>\\\nOne of the challenges of crypto’s emergence into mainstream adoption is that the landscape is more vulnerable to Wall Street price movements, and wider macroeconomic pressures could stunt XRP’s growth in 2025 as investment banks like Goldman Sachs  for the year ahead.</p><p>\\\nIt’s also worth looking at a decline in XRP funding rates, which have been  in recent weeks as traders open short positions following more widespread crypto market challenges.</p><p>\\\nFunding rates refer to the periodic payments between traders holding long and short positions to keep the price of perpetual futures contracts linked to the underlying asset they’re tracking.</p><p>\\\nHowever, a cause for optimism is that XRP’s bearish sentiment of late is far less pronounced than the likes of other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), indicating that an upturn in sentiment could see Ripple outperform the wider market.</p><p>Whether Ripple goes parabolic in 2025 or not will likely depend more on the state of the wider economic outlook in the United States and beyond. However, evidence of the incorporation of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial sector is likely to be a catalyst for growth for functional assets like XRP.</p><p>\\\nCrypto’s push towards the mainstream will transform the industry and can help to provide more exposure to its brightest projects. In terms of payment efficiency, an emboldened Ripple that’s free from the SEC’s shackles could form a formidable force.</p><p>\\\nThe future is difficult to predict amid wider crypto market volatility, but it’s difficult to think of a more exciting prospect in the cryptocurrency space right now than a resurgent Ripple.</p>","contentLength":5265,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Browser Use, the tool making it easier for AI ‘agents’ to navigate websites, raises $17M","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/23/browser-use-the-tool-making-it-easier-for-ai-agents-to-navigate-websites-raises-17m/","date":1742738400,"author":"Ivan Mehta","guid":10749,"unread":true,"content":"<article>We may not have an agreed-upon definition of AI “agent” yet, but a multitude of startups want to create “agentic” tools to automate various tasks online.

You can also avoid sharing this information by creating a new Google account for the purpose of uploading your data.</li><li>Consumer Reports will anonymize the data so it can’t extract any specific data about you, and it will store and process your Facebook data separately from any of your personal information.</li></ul><p>\\\nIf you’re a Facebook user, Consumer Reports will not collect your posts, including messages or photos—the download guide explains how to get the data Facebook has on you without downloading your personal content in the process. Additionally, even if you ultimately upload your personal content, Consumer Reports will only pull the data listed above for this study.</p><p>\\\nYou’ll be able to contribute data going forward, but Consumer Reports will start analyzing the data on Aug.&nbsp;14, and we’ll be looking to publish stories in the coming months.</p><p>\\\nWe hope you can join us.

Some of the headquarter's offices might remain in Washington, the people said, but it's not clear which ones those would be or who would keep their jobs... \n\nOne of the biggest fallouts is the damage it could do to coordination among NASA leadership on pressing issues... It would also limit cooperation with international partners on space, which is often done through embassies in Washington. NASA works with foreign partners on a range of projects, including the International Space Station and returning to the moon. The European Space Agency, for example, plans to provide modules for Gateway, a lunar space station that is central to NASA's Artemis program to land American astronauts back on the moon... The agency also helps coordinate support from foreign nations for the Artemis accords, which set goals for transparency and data sharing — and help create a level of trust in an unregulated part of the universe. \nBut the reallocation could have some benefits. Such a move would bring headquarters employees closer to the processes they manage. And it would give legislative liaison staff a chance to interact with lawmakers in their districts. \"You're probably getting a lot more time with [lawmakers] at the local center or hosting events in the state or district,\" said Tom Culligan, a longtime space lobbyist,, the space industry lobbyist.\n","contentLength":1946,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The TechBeat: House Of Doge And Dogecoin Foundation Unveil Board-Elect, Advisors And Global Dogecoin Adoption Plan (3/23/2025)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/3-23-2025-techbeat?source=rss","date":1742710260,"author":"Techbeat","guid":10339,"unread":true,"content":"<p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/darragh\">@darragh</a> [ 8 Min read ] \n Explore Trump's bold Mar‑a‑Lago Accord—a daring plan using century bonds, currency moves, and digital assets to reshape America's economy. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-the-hell-is-the-mar-a-lago-accord-and-why-should-you-care\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/dineshbesiahgari\">@dineshbesiahgari</a> [ 17 Min read ] \n AutoResponder AI automates email replies using AWS &amp; AI.
