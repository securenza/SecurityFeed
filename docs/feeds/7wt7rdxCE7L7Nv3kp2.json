This WEIRD skew may hinder understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for non-WEIRD populations.</p></blockquote><p>The moral may be that human factors and usability needs to be localized.</p>","contentLength":1387,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Microsoft Warns of StilachiRAT: A Stealthy RAT Targeting Credentials and Crypto Wallets","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-stilachirat-stealthy.html","date":1742281200,"author":"The Hacker News","guid":1169,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Microsoft is calling attention to a novel remote access trojan (RAT) named StilachiRAT that it said employs advanced techniques to sidestep detection and persist within target environments with an ultimate aim to steal sensitive data.\nThe malware contains capabilities to \"steal information from the target system, such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information, data stored</article>","contentLength":397,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4UQvJMRpqbL6RzzQypEGHMxf74IOtKNCrYK853AToX1QIq0XRnS28nHFDbCPfjOLRThz37pTRPUTwsUlMKhr3FoEAPtpI-puHr-b2uyPE8OSp6cwiiGGAoPL8F-9sPASlvrpB8RXMcwa_vXiLReutIR1Pv80PiogITxsszkCpOvxCoDkDQ0HTK-i4cMUQ/s1600/malware.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"BlackLock ransomware claims nearly 50 attacks in two months","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blacklock-ransomware-claims-nearly-50-attacks-in-two-months/","date":1742244019,"author":"Bill Toulas","guid":1087,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation called 'BlackLock' has emerged as one of the more active ransomware operations of 2025.

While nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates for attacks are crucial.</p><p>In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute force attacks on several real-word applications.</p><p>In particular, we optimize KASUMI (used in GPRS/GSM),SPECK (used in RFID communication), andTEA3 (used in TETRA). Our best optimizations allow us to try 2, 2, and 2 keys per second on a single RTX 4090 GPU. Those results improve upon previous results significantly, e.g. our KASUMI implementation is more than 15 times faster than the optimizations given in the CRYPTO’24 paper [ACC+24] improving the main results of that paper by the same factor.</p><p>With these optimizations, in order to break GPRS/GSM, RFID, and TETRA communications in a year, one needs around 11.22 billion, and 1.36 million RTX 4090GPUs, respectively.</p><p>For KASUMI, the time-memory trade-off attacks of [ACC+24] can be performed with142 RTX 4090 GPUs instead of 2400 RTX 3090 GPUs or, when the same amount of GPUs are used, their table creation time can be reduced to 20.6 days from 348 days,crucial improvements for real world cryptanalytic tasks.</p></blockquote><p>Attacks always get better; they never get worse.
