He did not wish to share his name.</p><p>\"Higher tariffs raise costs for freight forwarders like us, as well as for factories, companies, and sellers.

Fuling noted that nearly two-thirds of the company's revenue in 2023 and the first half of last year came from the US.</p><p>To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Fuling, which is headquartered in China's Zhejiang province, started a new factory in Indonesia late last year. </p><p>But Trump's new tariffs have introduced more uncertainty for Chinese exports from Indonesia are now subject to a 32% levy, the company said in a corporate filing. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Indonesia was hit along with much of the world in President Trump's announcement of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o\">expansive tariffs last week</a>, which he claimed would allow the US economy to flourish. </p><p>But economists have warned of a US and global recession. The tariffs have also shaken world markets and drawn criticism from billionaire CEOs, including Trump's ally Elon Musk. </p><p>Trump's import taxes include a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US, and higher custom tariffs for what he calls the \"worst offenders\".

the U.S. government. In their current form, rising prices are inevitable.</p><p>\"We are therefore convinced that fair competition, open markets, and partnership relations with the United States are in the interest of both sides and continue to rely on the U.S. government to strive to maintain a strong and growing economy and an attractive climate for businesses.\"</p><p> contacted the media section of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office for comment via email outside of normal business hours.</p><p>The comments underscore what many economists have warned about tariffs—that they will drive up inflation because they function as a tax on American consumers.</p><p>Higher costs for businesses and consumers threaten to trigger a recession in the U.S., and such fears are driving sharp losses in the stock markets.</p><p>Advocates of tariffs say these costs are worth it to rebuild America's manufacturing sector, create high-paying jobs, and keep supply chains secure from a national security point of view.</p><p>The best way to avoid the tariffs, Trump has told businesses, is to make goods inside the U.S.</p><p>EU officials had suggested sector-specific zero-for-zero tariffs with the U.S., such as in industrial goods and autos, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-rejects-europe-tariffs-offer-2056776\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Donald Trump Rejects Europe's Offer to Drop Tariffs: 'They Are Screwing Us'\" rel=\"noopener\">but Trump rejected the idea</a>.</p><p>Asked if this was \"enough\" by a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday evening, Trump replied: \"No, it's not.\"</p><p>\"The EU has been very tough over the years, I always say it was formed really to do damage to the United States in trade, that's the reason it was formed,\" Trump said.</p><p>The president said the EU is taking advantage of the U.S. through its reliance on American defense spending via <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato\" data-sys=\"1\">NATO</a> and because of the trade deficit.</p><p>He wants the European bloc to open its market more to American companies. He sees the current trading relationship as strongly imbalanced in the EU's favor.</p><p>\"We're paying them to guard them militarily and they're screwing us on trade, so that's not a good combination,\" Trump said.</p><p>Senior European officials are urging their companies not to invest in the U.S. as a consequence of the tariffs, calling for a unified response.</p><h2>Trump: I'm Defending U.S. From Trade Cheaters</h2><p>On Tuesday evening, as his tariffs were about to take effect, against a backdrop of sharp stock market losses and rising borrowing costs for the U.S. government, Trump accused America's trading partners of having \"cheated.\"</p><p>\"I'm proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers,\" Trump said in a speech to the National <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican\" data-sys=\"1\">Republican</a> Congressional Committee (NRCC) in Washington D.C.</p><p>\"The president who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street. Who protects the middle class, not the political class. And who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe.</p><p>\"They're trade cheaters. They cheated on us. They cheated with tariffs on us. They stole our money, they stole our jobs.\"</p><p>, Germany's outgoing economy minister, argued for a united European response, according to Reuters: \"The stock markets are already collapsing and the damage could become even greater… America is in a position of weakness.\"</p><p><strong>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen</strong> said on Monday: \"We stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners. Because Europe is always ready for a good deal, so we keep it on the table. But we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests.\"</p><p>, White House senior counselor for trade, told <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fox\" data-sys=\"1\">Fox</a> News: \"I guarantee no recession. Why? Because when we pass the biggest, broadest tax cut in history within a matter of months, that's going to be a great stimulus.\"</p><p>The EU is expected to confirm its retaliatory tariff package by mid-April, with preliminary details already circulating among member states.</p><p>Industry groups in the U.S. and Europe are lobbying for carve-outs or exemptions, warning that a prolonged tariff exchange could disrupt key supply chains, especially in heavy machinery and automotive sectors.</p><p>Future trade negotiations between Washington and Brussels remain uncertain, with both sides sending mixed signals about hardening stances and an openness to making a deal.</p>","contentLength":5079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jv14ct/well_pass_trump_tariffs_back_as_higher_prices_for/"},{"title":"Trump Tariffs Take Effect, Risking Full-Blown Trade War","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6OeKuuFbl0","date":1744188145,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":21008,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Trump’s&nbsp;so-called reciprocal tariffs are now in place, dealing a thunderous blow to the world economy as he pushes forward efforts to drastically reorder global trade.

The first delivery is scheduled for 2026, followed by ongoing deliveries to the Swedish Armed Forces. FMV has emphasized the importance of short lead times in this procurement in order to deliver operational capability to the armed forces in a limited timeframe. The radar systems are expected to enhance both air and maritime situational awareness and provide increased operational mobility due to their inherently mobile configuration. According to FMV project manager Per Schylström, the ability to rapidly reinforce radar coverage in prioritized areas is a key operational benefit of the new system.</p><p>The GM200 MM/C acquisition is linked to a pre-existing Letter of Intent between Sweden and the Netherlands. This framework includes provisions for information exchange, harmonization of technical requirements and contractual terms for future procurements, the alignment of maintenance agreements and system development, and coordination of industrial cooperation. FMV considers supply security a central factor in this procurement, aiming to distribute delivery risks and meet the need for high production capacity.</p><p>Sweden becomes the fifth NATO country to select the GM200 MM/C radar. The system, produced by Thales Nederland, was introduced in 2024 and was developed in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Army. The radar is part of the Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission (GM200 MM) family and shares technology with land-based GM200 and naval NS100/200 systems. The GM200 MM/C is optimized for Counter Battery and Weapon Locating operations and supports missions ranging from Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) to Medium Range Air Defence (MRAD). It is deployable in less than two minutes and is transportable by road, rail, or tactical aircraft.</p><p>The radar uses 4D Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology, which features dual-axis multi-beam capabilities allowing unrestricted beam steering in both azimuth and elevation. It operates in the S-band frequency and incorporates full Doppler waveforms, Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM) capabilities, and Gallium Nitride (GaN) transmitters. It also integrates cyber protection and is interoperable with NATO secret networks. The GM200 MM/C provides an instrumented range of over 400 kilometers, elevation coverage up to 80°, and ceiling coverage up to 100,000 feet. It is designed for 24/7 availability in environments without GPS or in the presence of electronic warfare interference.</p><p>Detection capabilities of the GM200 MM/C include Air Breathing Targets (ABTs), hovering helicopters, cruise missiles, sea surface targets, rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), and unmanned aerial vehicles ranging from Class I (Mini) to Class IV (High Altitude Long Endurance). The radar offers automatic detection, tracking, and classification of targets, including simultaneous support for air surveillance and counter-battery operations. It supports functions such as point of origin and point of impact determination and kill assessment for ground-based air defense missions. The system features software-defined radar architecture, enabling future capability expansion without requiring major upgrades or prolonged service interruptions.</p><p>The unit price for the GM200 MM/C is approximately €14.5 million, based on the Danish procurement of five radars in 2022 for a total of DKK 540 million. Other confirmed operators of the GM200 MM/C include the Netherlands, which ordered 26 units; Denmark, with five units ordered in 2023; Norway, with eight units ordered across 2021 and 2022; and Lithuania, which selected the radar in 2023 for installation on Mercedes-Benz Zetros 6×6 trucks. Brazil also ordered the GM200 MM/A variant in 2024. The United Kingdom has signaled interest in procuring the GM200 MM/C for the Serpens Project, potentially to be installed on mission modules for the Boxer vehicle.</p><p>The GM200 MM/C system’s design enables use in both fixed and mobile configurations and supports rapid redeployment, with full mobility and “sense and scoot” functionality achievable in under five minutes. The radar is platform-independent and can be operated either locally or remotely. It features standard interfaces for integration with existing systems.</p>","contentLength":4327,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1juyg0u/sweden_becomes_fifth_nato_country_to_procure_the/"},{"title":"China Braces for Trump's 104% Tariffs | Bloomberg: The China Show 4/9/2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvjFyKDtLqM","date":1744175882,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20983,"unread":true,"content":"<article>“Bloomberg: The China Show” is your definitive source for news and analysis on the world's second-biggest economy.

Trump and members of his administration have said that what they consider non-tariff trade barriers — which include currency manipulation, tax policies viewed as unfair and the use of sweatshop labor — are more important than tariffs. That’s why they’ve rejected various nations’ offers to set their tariffs to 0% on US goods in exchange for the same treatment.\n    </p><p data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm97lkjy4000b3b6mii7wy5fq@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Trump’s tariffs have hit the world’s second-largest economy, China, the hardest.

Sitting next to Israel's Prime Minister, Donald Trump said the US was holding direct talks with Iran. The aim: a deal over Tehran's nuclear program. Trump unilaterally pulled out of the last Iran nuclear deal in 2018, during his first presidency. The White House has confirmed that negotiations are set to continue on Saturday in Oman and will be led by the man seemingly tasked with solving all the world's crises - special envoy Steve Witkoff. \n\nThe great danger that Donald Trump is alluding to there is potential military action. He's threatened to bomb Iran if it fails to agree to a nuclear deal. Iranian officials today were sceptical about Saturday's talks, but they have agreed to take part. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said they would be indirect, likely with Omani mediators shuttling between the parties. He said Tehran wants to see concrete gestures from the US before any officials talk face-to-face.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 The announcement on nuclear\n2:24 Holly Dagres, Foreign policy analyst\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#trump #iran #nuclear</article>","contentLength":1554,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/-nTTTrNQNMc?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trump says nations are “kissing my ass” to negotiate tariffs","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/08/politics/video/trump-claims-nations-kissing-my-ass-to-negotiate-tariffs","date":1744169179,"author":"/u/IlustriousCoffee","guid":21014,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Despite turbulent markets, President Trumpis showing no signs of negotiating deals on reciprocal tariffs.

Many in Mexico viewed the designation as moving the United States toward its first military strike on neighboring Mexico in more than a century.</p><p>Sheinbaum has agreed to stepped-up military and Central Intelligence Agency surveillance flights over Mexico in a bid to gather intelligence on cartel operations, officials have said.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-21/trump-militarizes-approach-to-mexico\">military strikes </a>would probably cross a red line and could trigger a sharp deterioration in U.S.-Mexico relations — and, experts say, could result in curtailed cooperation in battling illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and resolving other cross-border issues.</p><p>“Unilateral U.S. strikes on Mexican soil would be devastating for the bilateral relations and could be detrimental to the objective of fighting drug cartels,” Gustavo A. Flores-Macías, professor of government at Cornell University, wrote via email.</p><p>“The Mexican government would face tremendous domestic pressure to respond in the strongest possible terms — including severing diplomatic relations with the U.S. and collapsing binational cooperation on migration and security, among other topics,” wrote Flores-Macías.</p><p>The issue of U.S. interference is an extremely sensitive one in a country that lost more than half of its national territory — including present-day California — in the 1846-48 Mexican-American War, a conflict widely viewed here as an act of U.S. imperial aggression. Mexico also endured 20th century incursions, including the 1914 U.S. military occupation of the port of Veracruz and the unsuccessful 1916-17 expedition to capture Gen. Francisco “Pancho” Villa, the Mexican revolutionary leader. </p><p>Although drone strikes would undoubtedly produce the kind of kinetic optics that President Trump favors, experts have questioned their use against Mexican cartels — highly atomized operations that often produce clandestine drugs in primitive laboratories that can be easily replaced. </p><p>Sheinbaum has won widespread praise at home and abroad for her administration’s “cool-headed” talks with the Trump administration on the contentious issue of tariffs. The White House has imposed duties on imports of automobiles, steel and aluminum from Mexico, but has largely maintained <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-04-03/trade-war-heats-up-mexico-keeps-calm-as-canada-hits-back\">the free-trade regimen </a>of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, signed in 2020, during Trump’s first White House term.</p><p>But Trump has also charged that Mexico is “essentially run by the cartels” — an assertion rejected by Sheinbaum, who has said that Mexico would defend its sovereignty against “violations by land, sea or air.”</p><p>Under the leadership of Sheinbaum, who took office in October, Mexico has stepped up actions against organized crime, arresting scores of alleged traffickers, making record busts of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and shipping 29 purported cartel capos to the United States to face trial. She has quietly dropped the “hugs not bullets” approach of her predecessor and mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who reduced U.S.-Mexico coordination on anti-drug efforts and was widely criticized for not taking a more aggressive stance toward cartels that dominate wide swaths of Mexican territory.</p><p>Trump has praised Sheinbaum’s actions, calling her a “marvelous woman.” But the U.S. president has still insisted that the United States should “wage war” against drug cartels.</p><p><i>Special correspondent Cecilia Sánchez Vidal contributed to this report. </i></p>","contentLength":4563,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jurx7n/mexico_warns_against_potential_us_drone_strikes/"},{"title":"Reciprocal Tariffs Go In Effect At Midnight | Balance of Power: Late Edition","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qjrqU0Vun4","date":1744154902,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20952,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business.

Just 13 per cent of the public said they would oppose a campaign of this nature.</p><p>It comes after the ‘Buy Canadian’ movement in Canada sparked a surge in people buying locally produced goods, with prime minister <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a> urging people to do so wherever they can. </p><p>But speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Ms Reeves said that “ratcheting up barriers to trade, ratcheting up tariffs will not be in our country’s interests, whether that’s in inflation or indeed for supply chains”.</p><p>She added: “In terms of buying British, I think everyone will make their own decisions.</p><p>“What we don’t want to see is a trade war, with Britain becoming inward-looking, because if every country in the world decided that they only wanted to buy things produced in their country, that is not a good way forward.”</p><p>Asked if the prime minister would echo his chancellor’s sentiment, Sir Keir’s official spokesman said: “Of course. We’re an open-trading nation.</p><p>“That is something the prime minister and the chancellor have previously said, and we want to see fewer trade barriers around the world, such that we’re continuing to support our economy.</p><p>“At the same time, we also continue to prioritise and support British manufacturers, British producers.</p><p>“We have a significant programme of support, whether it’s farmers, whether it’s manufacturers, as yesterday with supporting the car industry. So, we can take a two-pronged approach.</p><p>“We can be an open-trading nation whilst also supporting British producers and manufacturers.”</p><p>Pressed on whether the PM can sympathise with public support for a ‘Buy British’ campaign, the official said: “No. That goes against our agenda as an open trading nation. Business have been very clear they don’t want to see a knee-jerk reaction, that includes retaliation. </p><p>“We’ll keep all options on the table but we want to see lower trade barriers, not higher trade barriers.”</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have piled pressure on the government to launch a campaign urging people to shop local and back British-made goods, with Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper urging the PM to “listen to the public” and launch a “national effort to back British businesses”. </p><p>Ms Cooper added: “This would send a collective message to the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/white-house\">White House</a> that we are not prepared to simply cower in the corner while <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> takes a wrecking ball to people’s jobs and living standards.</p><p>“That needs to be combined with a clear plan to unleash the potential of our businesses and high streets, including scrapping the disastrous jobs tax and reforming the broken business rates.”</p><p>The trade taxes Mr Trump imposed on goods from most countries resulted in the value of US stocks dropping sharply when markets opened on Monday, following falls in London and across Europe and Asia earlier.</p><p>The UK government is currently attempting to negotiate a deal which would exempt British industry from the sweeping tariffs, with Downing Street saying the talks are at an “advanced stage”.</p><p>But asked by reporters in the White House if he was open to pausing tariffs to allow for negotiations, the US leader said: “We’re not looking at that.”</p><p>Mr Trump also suggested that the levies could be both a negotiating tool to extract concessions out of other countries, as well as a means to raise cash for US coffers.</p><p>Savanta interviewed 2,170 UK adults online between April 4 and April 6 2025.</p>","contentLength":4057,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jurabf/half_of_britons_less_likely_to_buy_us_goods_after/"},{"title":"Stocks Hit by Wild Volatility on US-China Threats | Bloomberg: The Close 04/08/2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mac_vE-p5As","date":1744153360,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20941,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Bloomberg Television brings you the latest news and analysis leading up to the final minutes and seconds before and after the closing bell on Wall Street.

The move marks an escalation of the Canada-U.S. trade war in the middle of a federal election campaign, and could increase the price of U.S.-made autos by as much as 25 per cent.</p><p>The countertariffs are the first imposed by Mark Carney since he became Prime Minister, and the first enacted during Canada’s 45th general election campaign, which ends with voting on April 28. Responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and his repeated talk of making Canada the 51st state has been central to Mr. Carney’s strategy in the campaign, in which his Liberals are polling ahead of their Conservative competition.</p><p>Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced the retaliatory auto tariffs would apply as of 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The federal government had promised this response after Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made automobiles, including from Canada, but had not yet followed through until Tuesday’s abrupt announcement.</p><p>“Canada continues to respond forcefully to all unwarranted and unreasonable tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canadian products,” Mr. Champagne said in a statement. “The government is firmly committed to getting these U.S. tariffs removed as soon as possible, and will protect Canada’s workers, businesses, economy and industry.”</p><p>Canada had already imposed countertariffs on about $60-billion worth of U.S. imports in response to levies enacted by Mr. Trump earlier this year on a broad range of goods, including Canadian steel and aluminum.</p><p>A trade dispute involving the North American auto sector will not only cost consumers more, but also threatens to damage the structure of an industry that relies on an integrated supply chain across the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Up to 60 per cent of cars purchased in Canada each year are imported from the United States, according to Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association. He said Canada is the among the largest export markets for American-made cars, and estimated about 1.2 million vehicles are imported from the United States every year.</p><p>The tariffs will be 25 per cent on the portion of each vehicle imported from the U.S. that did not originate in Canada or Mexico, in cases where the manufacturing complies with the rules of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA). It will also be 25 per cent on each fully assembled vehicle imported from the U.S. where the automobile’s manufacturing does not comply with USMCA rules.</p><p>These countermeasures will remain in place until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against the Canadian auto sector, the federal Finance Department said in a statement.</p><p>The government said duties collected will be used to benefit the Canadian auto sector. Vehicle imports from the U.S. totalled $35.6-billion in 2024, Finance said. Last week, Mr. Carney estimated these retaliatory tariffs would collect $8-billion on an annual basis.</p><p>Mr. Volpe said Canadians could end up paying 15 per cent to 25 per cent more for a vehicle imported from the United States depending on what portion of the automobile is not Canadian or Mexican content.</p><p>On April 3, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of 25 per cent on Canadian automobiles and light trucks and vowed another 25-per-cent tariff on some Canadian auto parts starting May 3. The <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/tariff/\">tariffs</a> on Canadian-made autos will be reduced based on their U.S.-made content. Most of the vehicles assembled at Ontario’s plants have about 50-per-cent U.S. content.</p><p>Mr. Volpe said he believes Canada’s retaliation is justified, even though it will increase prices for cars in Canada. “It will hurt,” he said, but he added that the U.S. will feel the pressure too. “It’s important not to leave these things unanswered,” he said of U.S. protectionism.</p><p>He noted that Ottawa’s retaliation, at least for now, does not include counter-tariffs on U.S. auto parts.</p><p>The caretaker convention guides the federal government after Parliament has been dissolved and an election called. This means government is supposed to limit itself to routine matters or urgent events but generally not take steps that bind a future government.</p><p>Brian Clow, who served as deputy chief of staff to then-prime minister Justin Trudeau, defended Mr. Carney’s decision to impose tariffs during an election campaign.</p><p>The Prime Minister was responding to new U.S. tariffs imposed on Canada during the campaign, he noted.</p><p>“It’s well-established that the Prime Minister and cabinet can act during a crisis, and I would say that this is a clear crisis,” Mr. Clow said.</p><p>Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, was in Washington on Monday and Tuesday, lobbying for an end to all the tariffs imposed on Canadian cars and trucks, steel and aluminum – and for the scrapping of the American plan, set to go into effect May 3, to impose 25-per-cent tariffs on non-U.S. auto parts.</p><p>In an interview, Mr. Fedeli said he met with automotive industry representatives from both sides of the border and two Republican members of Congress – New York’s Claudia Tenney and Indiana’s Rudy Yakym. He also met with officials in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>He says that in addition to making the case against all of the President’s tariffs on Canada, he is also focusing in the short term on convincing the U.S. to leave Canadian auto parts untouched by additional levies.</p><p>Mr. Fedeli says his message to U.S. officials is that this will be far too complicated and too damaging to the auto industry’s integrated supply chains that see some car parts cross the border multiple times.</p><p>“Nobody can figure out how to do that. It’s so complicated that what we’ve said to them is ‘Look, leave the parts the way they are.’ This is really our message,” Mr. Fedeli said. “You really can’t delve into trying to unscramble that omelette.”</p><p>He said so far, the U.S. officials he has met with seem receptive and understand Ontario’s point of view.</p><p>Echoing Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s comments last week, Mr. Fedeli said he supported Mr. Carney’s move to impose retaliatory 25-per-cent tariffs on the non-Canadian portion of U.S.-made cars and trucks.</p><p>“The people of Canada expect that. We did that last time, in Trump 1.0, we put reciprocal tariffs, we fought back,” Mr. Fedeli said. “And I think they’re a step in the right direction, of course.”</p><p>A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association.

The loss of market capitalization worldwide has reached $10 trillion (€9.2 trillion), according to Bloomberg. That is a figure equivalent to just over half of the GDP of the European Union. For part of Monday’s session, the S&amp;P 500 index, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, accumulated three consecutive drops of 4% for the first time since the Great Depression. The session-by-session collapse was also the largest since the Black Monday crisis of 1987, surpassing the losses recorded during the outbreak of the Covid pandemic (13% in three sessions), the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (13.9%), or the losses of 1998 (11.7%). In 1987, the U.S. stock market plummeted 26% over the course of three days.</p><p>While stocks have felt the impact globally, value destruction operates on a different scale in the United States. <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2023-11-15/why-the-magnificent-seven-of-the-us-stock-market-may-be-less-than-magnificent.html\">The so-called Magnificent Seven</a> (Apple, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Tesla) are the global companies that have lost the most stock market value, totaling €1.5 trillion since Thursday. The leaders of five of these businesses attended Trump’s inauguration: the top executives of Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Google (Sundar Pichai), Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Apple (Tim Cook), <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-04-07/teslas-local-gigafactories-help-protect-musk-from-trumps-tariffs.html\">and, of course, Tesla </a>(Elon Musk). These five companies have incurred losses of €1.26 trillion in three days due to Trump’s tariff policy.</p><p>Apple leads the list, with losses of more than half a trillion dollars. Nvidia comes next with $385 billion, followed by Amazon, with $262 billion, ahead of the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Tesla has lost the least value, but that is because it is the least valuable of the group. Apple’s value drop has been very large in percentage terms (16.8%) and in absolute value, as it is directly impacted by the tariffs; analysts expect sharp price increases for its devices, which are manufactured entirely in Asia. In contrast, Meta and Google, which are both software-focused companies, have lost less than half that amount in relative terms. “This sudden volatility comes after a long period of calm in the stock market,” according to the wealth management group Mirabaud, “which makes the recent sell-off even more striking.” According to this asset manager, private investors have abandoned technology, and hedge funds have followed suit.</p><p>Coming behind the Magnificent Seven in terms of stock market losses is the leading non-U.S. stock, the Saudi state oil company Aramco, which lost €126 billion, albeit only 8% in value. Then come the giants of the traditional U.S. economy: JP Morgan, Eli Lilly, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Bank of America... Icons of the great America championed by Trump, who have nevertheless suffered firsthand from the president’s attempts to reverse globalization and have hemorrhaged more than €50 billion in three days. UBS analysts have remarked that the spike in volatility is fundamental and could be long-lasting: “This won’t suddenly fade away unless we start to see signs that the U.S. might not enter a recession or tariffs begin to ease.”</p><p>European companies are typically smaller than American ones, which is why their market capitalization losses have also been more modest. So far, the European stocks that have lost the most market capitalization are British companies: HSBC and Shell, followed by Siemens (Germany), LVMH (France), Total (France), and SAP (Germany). Companies from Denmark (Novo Nordisk), Ireland (Accenture), and the Netherlands (ASML) are also on the list of the biggest losers. Other companies include some from China (Alibaba), Japan (Toyota and Mitsubishi), Taiwan (TSMC), which lost €78 billion in value in just one session (last week was partly a holiday in the country), and Samsung, with €35 billion in three days.</p><p>Without <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2025-04-04/whats-behind-trumps-strange-and-basic-tariff-formula.html\">trade negotiations or concessions</a> on the horizon, the market seems headed for more jitters and instability, a scenario with an end-of-an-era feel that is being echoed in investment banking reports. “Investors must now confront the possibility that Pax Americana (American peace, in Latin), an era of relative stability and global order under the influence of the United States after World War II, is coming to an end,” reported Muzinich &amp; Co., an investment firm whose CEO was Undersecretary of the Treasury in Trump’s first term.</p>","contentLength":4415,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1juklqu/the_tariff_bomb_wipes_out_10_trillion_in_stock/"},{"title":"Trump Set to Hit China With Sweeping 104% Tariffs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veAd8yLEzxc","date":1744136434,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20758,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The White House says President Donald Trump will impose sweeping 104% tariffs on many Chinese goods on April 9 at 12:01 am ET.

Initially some €26 billion worth of trade had been in the commission’s crosshairs. However, it reconsidered import duties on bourbon and other products, on foot of lobbying from capitals. </p><p>Barry Cowen, a Fianna Fáil MEP, said the decision to not tariff US bourbon and dairy was welcome.

We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us, so that is a losing hand for them.\"</p><p>The comments come a day ahead of the U.S. raising its duties on China and dozens of other nations as part of so-called reciprocal tariffs whose purpose, Bessent said, is to bring trading partners to the negotiating table and jobs back to the U.S.</p><p>So far, he said Japan has been at the forefront of countries eager to negotiate, and the White House expects a multitude of others.</p><p>\"I think you are going to see some very large countries with large trade deficits come forward very quickly,\" Bessent said. \"If they come to the table with solid proposals, I think we can end up with some good deals.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the hope would be to generate both jobs and revenue from the tariffs, he added.</p><p>\"If we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs,\" Bessent said. \"If we're successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you're taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline.\"</p><p>In return, President <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> said he will slap another 50% charge on Chinese imports if the tariff is not withdrawn. The U.S. in 2024 ran a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China, or about one-third of the entire imbalance.</p><p>With the tariffs, Trump is hoping to open up more markets for American products and reshore manufacturing operations to the U.S. However, the administration is not simply focusing on absolute tariff levels from other nations but rather nontariff barriers such as currency manipulation, Europe's value-added tax and other methods the White House says undermine fair trade.</p><p>\"Everything is on the table,\" Bessent said. \"The academic literature shows that it's actually the nontariff barriers which are harder, both harder to quantify and ... they're more insidious because they're hidden, they're obfuscated.\"</p><p>Stock market futures, which already had been indicating a strong open on Wall Street, added to gains after Bessent spoke.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE</strong></em></p><p><em>Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

Since taking office on January 20, Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to restart talks with North Korean leader <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/kim-jong-un\" data-sys=\"1\">Kim Jong Un</a>. Pyongyang, however, has remained silent, accusing Washington of intensifying hostile policies despite the change in administration.</p><figure></figure><p>The incident underscores ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where high-level diplomatic efforts have stalled and military posturing has intensified. While similar border violations have occurred in the past—such as one in June 2024 that also prompted warning shots—they rarely result in direct conflict. The current intrusion comes amid heightened political instability in South Korea and continued provocations from the North.</p><p>South Korea is navigating the fallout from the dramatic ouster of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week. Yoon was removed from office after his controversial decision to impose martial law in the wake of mass protests—a move that was widely condemned at home and abroad. The leadership vacuum in Seoul has further complicated the already fragile security situation on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>The Demilitarized Zone stretches 248 kilometers (155 miles) across the peninsula and is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) wide. It remains one of the most fortified borders in the world, layered with barbed wire, land mines, tank traps, and combat units. The DMZ was established as part of the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, which never formally concluded with a peace treaty.</p><p>Tuesday's incursion follows a pattern of similar low-level violations that have not escalated into major flashpoints. South Korean authorities have previously assessed such movements as accidental, especially in regions with dense vegetation and poor visibility of boundary markers. Last year's incident involved North Korean soldiers carrying construction tools, and officials at the time concluded there was no deliberate attempt to provoke confrontation.</p><p>The South Korean military did not attribute a motive to the North's movement but reaffirmed its readiness.</p><p>\"Our military issued warnings and fired warning shots, and the North Korean soldiers retreated,\" a South Korean  official told reporters.</p><p>\"We are closely observing the North's military status and taking necessary measures to plan our strategy.\"</p><p><strong>South Korean political analysts</strong> suggested the North may be testing reaction times or unintentionally breaching the boundary due to ongoing construction or terrain challenges.

At the same time, aerospace giant Boeing may find it hard to find foreign buyers for its<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/the-boeing-f-47-the-air-forces-next-generation-air-dominance-fighter\"> sixth-generation F-47</a>, the centerpiece of the United States Air Force‘s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) system of systems.</p><p>Some of America‘s closest allies are already exploring other options. Two competing sixth-generation fighter programs are underway, and now one could expand.</p><h3><strong>Will Australia and Canada Join GCAP?</strong></h3><p>According to a recent report from aviation trade magazine<a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/fixed-wing/australia-confirms-informational-meeting-with-gcap-fighter-partners/162367.article\"></a>, an official with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has received an “informational briefing [on] the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) consortium—a trilateral initiative between the UK, Italy, and Japan to develop a sixth-generation fighter.”</p><p>Originally known as the Tempest in the UK,<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/gcap-just-ngad-another-6th-generation-fighter-trouble-211977\"> the program</a> aims to field an aircraft by the mid-2030s, replacing Japan‘s F-2 and the Eurofighter Typhoon used by the UK and Italy. The fighter is expected to feature optional manning, an augmented reality cockpit, “Loyal Wingmen” support, and possibly directed-energy weapons and AI co-pilots.</p><p>Last October, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, the UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey, and Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto met on the sidelines of the Group of Seven defense minister meeting in Naples. It announced that the GCAP International Government Organization (GIGO) would be set up to<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/forget-ngad-global-combat-air-program-might-be-6th-gen-stealth-fighter-program-watch\"> oversee the development</a> of the next-generation fighter.</p><p>As reported by , Australia has expressed interest in joining the effort and could be joined by Canada. Following the Trump administration‘s decision last month to impose a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/trump-tariffs-trade.html\">25 percent</a> tariff on Canadian imports and the president‘s repeated calls to make the neighbor to the north the “fifty-first state,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney launched a review into Ottawa‘s deal with Washington to purchase eighty-eight F-35s.</p><p>Ottawa has reportedly explored alternatives, including the<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/frances-rafale-is-soaring-in-popularity/#:~:text=An%20Overview%20of%20the%20Rafale&amp;text=The%20French%20government%20required%20a,Super%20Etendard%2C%20and%20other%20platforms.\"> French-made Dassault Rafale</a> and the Swedish<a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/not-so-fast-america-shoots-down-swedens-gripen-jet-deal-with-colombia/\"> Saab JAS 39 Gripen</a>. Meanwhile, Canberra has also been reviewing its options, following Washington‘s 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the land down under.</p><p>Australia and Canada are members of the Commonwealth of Nations (AKA the British Commonwealth) and have deep ties with the UK. They have “Royal” air forces, the RAAF and Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which have operated British-designed/made fighters.</p><p>Last month, David Chadwick, a British Liberal Democrat MP for Brecon, Radnor, and Cwm Tawe, called for the UK‘s Ministry of Defence (MoD) to invite Canada to join the GCAP program. UK Defence Minister Maria Eagle responded that the consortium members would be open to Canada‘s cooperation on the program if it would not delay or otherwise impede it.</p><p><a href=\"https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/focus-australia-and-canada-consider-partnering-in-gcap-future-fighter-program-as-us-policy-changes-weaken-longtime-alliances\"> also reported</a> it signaled “a potential pathway for Canadian involvement, and analysts have noted that Canada may be a suitable candidate due to its membership in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and strong defense ties with the UK. Additionally, Canada‘s recent procurement of the F-35A aligns its fleet with those of the GCAP nations, all of which operate or plan to operate the same aircraft.”</p><p>Australia already operates the F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing variant of the Joint Strike Fighter, and is a member of the Australia, United Kingdom, United States<a href=\"https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/01/07/aukus-boosts-submarine-industrial-base-amid-challenges-in-u-s-shipbuilding/\"> (AUKUS) consortium</a> with the UK and the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>While it calls for closer ties between the three states, including the development of defense technology, its tier one program, centered on nuclear-powered submarines that all three nations could operate, has been criticized by President Donald Trump in the past.</p><p>Given these facts, Australia and Canada could likely become junior partners in the GCAP program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>About the Author: Peter Suciu</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/profile/peter-suciu\"></a><em> is a Michigan-based writer.

The Barents Observer counted the number of verdicts issued by military courts in the northern regions of Russia.</p><p>In Russian criminal law, military refusal to serve is divided into several categories. Unauthorized abandonment of a unit (Article 337 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) is when a serviceman leaves his place of service without permission, but without the clear intention to completely evade service.&nbsp;</p><p>Desertion (Article 338) is a more serious crime: a conscious and final departure with the intent not to return. Sometimes the investigation starts the case as desertion, but courts often reclassify it as unauthorized absence — especially if the serviceman returns voluntarily.</p><p>Faking illness (Article 339) is another way of evasion, where a serviceman tries to avoid service by pretending to have health problems. However, cases under this article are not initiated very often.</p><p>The difference between the articles is primarily in the wording and maximum terms: desertion carries up to 15 years, unauthorised absence up to 10, and faking illness also up to 10 years.</p><h3>Military towns in the Kola Peninsula</h3><p>The Murmansk Region is the only region in the north where six garrison military courts operate simultaneously. This is directly related to the region's dense military presence: the Northern Fleet is based here along with strategic submarines, air defence units and coastal troops.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost every second settlement in the region is a garrison town. Severomorsk, Polyarny, Gadzhievo, Zaozyorsk, Pechenga, Alakurtti, Vidyayevo - all these towns exist around military service. It was here that mobilisation and participation in the war was felt first and foremost, and it was here that there was a sharp increase in criminal cases against those who decided to refuse to fight.</p><p>The Murmansk Garrison Military Court issued 152 sentences in the course of the two first years of full-scale war, mainly under the article on unauthorised absence from the unit. Only three cases concerned desertion, although prosecutors often try to initiate cases with this more serious article.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the few sentences of desertion, the text of which was made publicly available, is the <a href=\"https://murmgvs--mrm.sudrf.ru/modules.php?name=sud_delo&amp;srv_num=1&amp;name_op=doc&amp;number=153729721&amp;delo_id=1540006&amp;new=0&amp;text_number=1\">case</a> of Yevgeny Safonov, a contract soldier of the Northern Fleet. He twice left the unit without permission. In one of the episodes, he returned, but instead of starting service, he climbed over the fence and left, not answering calls from the command. The court regarded this as failure to report for duty during mobilisation. Initially, he was accused of desertion, but the court mitigated the article and sentenced Safarov to three years in a general prison colony.</p><p>In the Gadzhiyevo Garrison Court, there have been 46 sentences since February 2022. For comparison: in 2021, there were only two such cases, in 2020 — one, in 2019 — two. An increase of more than twenty times.&nbsp;</p><p>In Severomorsk, where the headquarters of the Northern Fleet is located, 22 sentences have been issued since the start of the full-scale invasion. Before the war, there were only a few cases per year. In Zaozersk, there are another 113. In 2021, there were eleven cases here, in 2020 — two.</p><p>In Severomorsk, there is also another legal body — the Northern Fleet Military Court. It hears appeals against decisions of lower courts in the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions. Since October 2022, the court has issued 272 decisions on “military” articles.</p><p>Barents Observer <a href=\"https://ru.thebarentsobserver.com/ot-norvezskoj-granicy-do-polej-srazenij-v-ukraine-dmitrij-vasilec-rasskazyvaet-svou-istoriu/420138\">spoke</a> with one of the Russian 'refuseniks' — the 29-year-old Dmitry Vasilets, a former serviceman of the Northern Fleet. He spent a year and three months in a settlement colony to avoid returning to the war in Ukraine. According to Vasilets, he refused to carry out combat orders on moral grounds after the death of two close friends. In the interview, he said that in his brigade, at least five or six officers followed the same path, preferring to admit guilt and serve real terms — albeit minimal — rather than being sent back to the front.</p><p data-lab-font_weight=\"font-weight-normal\">In the Arkhangelsk region, cases of refusal to serve are distributed among three garrison courts — in Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk, and Mirny. Each of them reflects its military landscape: from coastal units to missile units and strategic facilities.</p><p data-lab-font_weight=\"font-weight-normal\">The Arkhangelsk garrison court recorded 114 sentences under 'military' articles. It is the largest court in the region by the number of cases, considering cases of both contract soldiers and those mobilised from support and communication units.</p><p>In Severodvinsk — a city where the Sevmash and Zvezdochka yards are located, building nuclear submarines for the Navy and carrying out their repairs — there is a separate garrison court. It has 94 sentences to its credit. Court decisions are not published, but the overall number shows that disciplinary and criminal pressure on those who do not want to serve remains high.</p><p>In Mirny — a city near the Plesetsk Cosmodrome — the situation clearly illustrates how quickly the workload on the garrison court can change. In 2022, there were no sentences here. In 2021, 2020, and 2019 — one case per year. And since the beginning of 2023 — 59 sentences, almost all under the article on 'absence without leave'.</p><p>In Komi, there is one military court in operation — the Vorkuta Military Court. After 2023, it started to publish decisions with the names of individuals involved. In total, there are 75 decisions on 'military' articles.&nbsp;</p><p>One of them is the case of V.V. Napalkov, convicted for two episodes of leaving his unit during the mobilisation period. He initially hid for three weeks, returned, then disappeared again for two months, living with friends and family.</p><p>The court sentenced Napalkov to 6 years and 6 months of imprisonment. He claimed he had received verbal permission to be absent, but the court did not believe him.</p><p>The Petrozavodsk Garrison Military Court — the only military court in Karelia — has issued 136 sentences on military articles over two years of war. For comparison, in 2021, there was only one such case, in 2020 — none, and in 2019 — three. That is, over the entire preceding five-year period, there were only four sentences, but after the invasion — an average of five per month.</p><p>This court publishes decisions with open names, and some materials remain available on the official website.</p><p>Among these is the sentence of V.R. Nummert, a contract soldier who did not return from leave in the autumn of 2022 and hid with relatives for over a year, working in various jobs. In court, he explained his behaviour as a fear of going to war and a desire to \"rest a little.\" The court did not accept these explanations and sentenced him to six years in a strict regime under Article 338 of the Russian Criminal Code.</p><p>If we add up all the mentioned decisions by garrison courts in northern Russia, there are more than 800 court decisions under Articles 337, 338, and 339 of the Criminal Code, starting from the spring of 2022. This is a minimum, as many courts do not publish decisions or hide them under general terms. The northern regions, especially those with military bases, are now areas where military personnel flee, hide, and fake illness. And military courts are increasing the flow of sentences.</p><p>The north is not the only region in Russia where mass refusals to participate in the war are recorded. According to an internal presentation for Russian officials, published by the Ukrainian community InformNapalm and analysed by Frontelligence Insight, the total number of documented cases of refusal to serve, including unauthorised absence, in 2024 amounted to 50,554. Most criminal cases were initiated in the Southern Military District — almost 12,000, of which 58% were mobilised from the so-called \"LDNR,\" <a href=\"https://istories.media/news/2025/03/05/mo-rf-zafiksirovalo-505-tis-sluchaev-dezertirstva-i-samovolnogo-ostavleniya-chasti-v-voyuyushchei-armii-za-2024-god/\">report</a>&nbsp;newspaper Important Stories.&nbsp;</p><p>BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/russian/articles/c0rgxvqnl02o\">reported</a> that in Ukraine, since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than 95,000 cases of desertion and unauthorised absence from duty have been opened.

Whether running AI models, spinning up infrastructure, or just trying to keep your SaaS lights on, the cost of relying on US-based hardware and cloud will rise. A lot. In this issue, we explore how the tariffs will reshape Europe’s cloud and AI landscape—and what you should be doing </p> to protect your margins, roadmap, and resilience. </p></div><div><p> Read on for the full article. </p></div><div><p><b>US tariffs are here—and they’ve landed squarely on the backbone of AI and cloud infrastructure.</b><p>On April 2nd, the US government introduced sweeping tariffs on imports, notably from tech hardware manufacturing hubs in East Asia. In a nutshell, US hardware manufacturers and resellers - even as a service - will pay a lot more to maintain production in the short term. </p></p></div><div><p> The fallout? A sudden and potentially severe cost increase for European companies building or running anything in the cloud. At the time of writing, no reciprocal (re-reciprocal?) tariffs have yet been introduced by the EU, but it’s a distinct possibility. </p></div><div><p> This isn’t just a spreadsheet problem. It’s a strategic one. Let’s break it down. </p></div><div><h2><b>What’s Getting More Expensive?</b></h2></div><div><p>Data centre gear—servers, networking equipment, racks, switches, the whole lot—is about to get pricier. Think of enterprise-grade server hardware suppliers: Dell, HP, and many more. If designed or assembled in the US, the price increase will be passed on to EU buyers. </p></div><div><p>US-based providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud may pass infrastructure cost increases to customers. Given that such providers already offer top-of-market pricing as a general rule, the days of cheap hyperscale cloud might be over—at least for Europe. </p></div><div><p>GPUs (think Nvidia, AMD) are mostly fabbed in Asia but are still designed in the US, and some are caught up in the tariff dragnet. Even where there’s an exemption, future uncertainty makes long-term AI projects riskier to plan and even more expensive to execute. </p></div><div><p>Finally, a silver lining. Tariff-driven cost increases could tip the scales in favour of European cloud and AI providers—assuming they can scale up fast enough. We may see a minor renaissance in EU cloud adoption purely out of necessity. </p></div><div><p> Here are a few EU alternatives to the big three US-based cloud providers: </p></div><div><table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"><p> France, Netherlands, Poland </p></td></tr><tr><td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"><p> Germany, Finland, Singapore, USA </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p>Organisations that are already multi-cloud or experimenting with sovereign or local clouds have a head start. This is the moment for strategic decoupling from US services—if possible in your stack. </p></div><div><p><b>Data centre expansion plans</b>Between tariffs on steel and electronics, the cost of building AI-ready infrastructure just jumped. Microsoft has already scaled back projects, and others are expected to follow. It should be mentioned that the scaling back of data centres is also impacted by the proliferation of cheaper Chinese AI models, not just international trade wars. </p></div><div><p><b>Startups and small players</b>Are you a European startup selling into the US, using AWS, paying for Nvidia compute, and backed by American VC? These are three pressure points now affected by tariffs or looming countermeasures. Expect reduced margins, longer sales cycles, and a harder pitch. </p></div><div><p>US VCs may withdraw from Europe, and European corporates may delay AI and cloud spending. If the EU retaliates with restrictions on US digital services, that fog of uncertainty only thickens. </p></div><div><h2><b>What about AI Agents, specifically?</b></h2></div><div><p><b>Increased Development Costs:</b> AI agents need much computing power for training and operation. This power comes from servers, GPUs, and other specialized processors. </p></div><div><p> Tariffs on servers and other hardware will increase the cost of this kit, directly increasing the cost of developing and deploying AI agents. </p></div><div><ul><li><p><b>Higher Operational Expenses:</b> Many AI agents operate in the cloud, utilizing services from providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. This means that the ongoing operational costs for AI agents that rely on this cloud infrastructure will also rise.</p></li><li><p> Increased costs can lead to reduced investment in research and development. If acquiring the necessary hardware and cloud resources becomes more expensive, companies may have to scale back their AI agent projects, potentially slowing down innovation in the field.</p></li><li><p><b>Impact on Specialized Hardware:</b> Advanced AI agents often require specialized hardware, such as high-performance GPUs. The tariffs on these components will likely affect the cost and availability of these crucial components, further hindering development. </p></li></ul></div><div><h2><b>What Should You Be Doing?</b></h2></div><div><ol start=\"1\"><li><p><b>Review your cloud spend exposure.</b> You're at risk if you’re an EU company and your stack is 100% US hyperscaler. At minimum, map your dependencies. More realistically, have at least a plan to migrate at least some of your workloads to EU-based providers. </p></li><li><p><b>Ask your vendors how they’re responding.</b> Will they absorb the costs, pass them on, or localise operations?</p></li><li><p><b>Reexamine your hardware sourcing.</b>.</p></li><li><p><b>Watch for EU countermeasures.</b> These might include digital services tariffs, procurement restrictions, or new data localisation rules. </p></li></ol></div><div><p><b>This is more than a trade spat.</b>These tariffs may be the starting pistol for a more fragmented AI and cloud market, where regional resilience becomes as essential as scale. </p></div><div><p> If your current strategy assumes infinite cheap GPU compute and seamless cross-border tech collaboration, it’s time to rethink. Start by asking: how much of your AI stack relies on infrastructure 6,000km away and suddenly 20% more expensive? </p></div><div><p> This isn’t a drill. It’s a new reality. </p></div><div><p><i>Want to become strategically nimble enough to profit from the geopolitical climate?</i></p></div><div><p><i>Temrel is an AI Automation and Workflow partner.

If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\"</p><p>Last Friday, China's Finance Ministry announced <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-to-impose-34percent-retaliatory-tariff-on-all-goods-imported-from-the-us.html\">34% in additional tariffs</a> on all goods imported from the U.S., starting April 10, in retaliation for Trump imposing new levies of 34% on China.</p><p>The across-the-board tariffs followed two previous rounds of 10%-15% tariffs, targeting mostly agricultural and energy products imported from the U.S. The broadened tariff scope reflects the Chinese leadership's diminished hopes for a trade deal with the U.S., said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at Teneo.</p><p>Trump's 34% tariffs on China were on top of the 20% duties rolled out since February, bringing the total&nbsp;new&nbsp;tariffs&nbsp;this year&nbsp;on China to 54%. The additional levies have lifted the U.S. weighted average tariff rate on China to as high as 65%, and could dent China's economy by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year, according to Morgan Stanley.</p></div><div><p>\"Since China already faces more than 60% in tariff rate, it doesn't really matter if it goes up by 50% or 500%,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, suggesting Beijing is prepared for a \"full on\" trade war with the U.S.</p><p>\"China is on the defensive side, but basically the two sides are testing each other's limit,\" Xu said.</p><p>As risks of an intense U.S.-China trade war rise, Beijing might resort to further retaliatory measures, such as stopping purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, matching U.S. tariffs, and further expansion of export controls on metals and minerals, Xu added.</p></div><div><p>The People's Bank of China on Tuesday set the&nbsp;midpoint rate <a href=\"http://www.pbc.gov.cn/zhengcehuobisi/125207/125217/125925/5665545/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">for onshore yuan</a><a href=\"http://www.pbc.gov.cn/zhengcehuobisi/125207/125217/125925/5665545/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">at 7.2038 per dollar</a>, the weakest level since September 2023, according to data provider Wind Information. The yuan is allowed to trade within a 2% band of this midpoint rate.</p><p>The yuan's weakening is a \"big signal,\" Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC's \"<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/\">Squawk Box Asia</a>,\" \"this is Beijing politely saying this is getting a little too much, we are putting you on notice, we can devalue if we want and bigger things may come if you keep this up.\"</p><p>\"This is a clear shot across the bow of Washington,\" Brooks added.</p><p>Chinese onshore yuan weakened as much as 0.39% to 7.3363 per dollar, while the offshore yuan was little changed.</p><p>U.S. State Department did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p><p>\"Escalation is probably the only short-term outcome, but negotiations will ultimately come as both sides feel the pinch of the economic slowdown,\" Xu said.</p><p>At a regular news conference on Tuesday, Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said Beijing would take \"necessary measures\" against U.S. tariff threats, according to a CNBC translation of reports in Chinese state media.</p><p>He reiterated the Commerce Ministry's statement, \"If U.S. insists on waging a tariff war, a trade war, China will fight till the end.\"</p></div>","contentLength":3400,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ju1piv/china_resolutely_opposes_trumps_50_tariff_threat/"},{"title":"'We lost everything,' Congo flood survivors say | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uldn_FsyVfg","date":1744074617,"author":"Reuters","guid":20217,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Residents of Kinshasa recounted harrowing experiences of survival after severe flooding swept through parts of the Congo's capital, killing dozens and leaving many more displaced. \n\n#News #congo #floods #africa #environment #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/42ABNqy \n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":608,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Uldn_FsyVfg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Thousands of Afghans deported as Pakistan intensifies crackdown","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V6s3ExwA2w","date":1744074005,"author":"DW News","guid":20220,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Thousands of Afghans have crossed the border from Pakistan in recent days, the United Nations and Taliban officials said, as Islamabad ramped up pressure for them to return to their country of origin.

Here in Europe, Germany's DAX plunged 10% on opening, before finishing the day more than 4% in the red. And there were similar losses in France and the UK. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of crashing stock markets and economic uncertainty, EU trade ministers gathered in Luxembourg to discuss their response to Washington's new trade regime. Starting on Wednesday, the EU will face tariffs of 20% on almost all exports to the United States. \n\nDonald Trump's levies are causing anxiety and anger in European capitals. The transatlantic trade relationship is the biggest in the world, worth 1.5 trillion euros. European officials say they would rather talk than fight the US on tariffs, but if push comes to shove all options are on the table.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#trump #tariffs #europe</article>","contentLength":1312,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/gR6BlFvcZ-w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trump gives China one day to end retaliations or face extra 50% tariffs","url":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/trump-gives-china-one-day-to-end-retaliations-or-face-extra-50-tariffs/","date":1744065439,"author":"/u/xpda","guid":20233,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jtyekc/trump_gives_china_one_day_to_end_retaliations_or/"},{"title":"Cambodian farmers race on ox carts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJhK69gayf4","date":1744065013,"author":"Reuters","guid":20208,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Cambodian farmers went full throttle by taking their best oxen to the race track at this year's annual ox cart race on April 7, just ahead of mid-April's Khmer New Year and rice-harvesting season.\n\n#cambodia #farmer #ox #cart #race #khmer</article>","contentLength":238,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/xJhK69gayf4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Trump warns Iran will be in 'great danger' if talks aren’t successful","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP2QLOhh1ho","date":1744063660,"author":"Associated Press","guid":20192,"unread":true,"content":"<article>President Donald Trump says the U.S. is holding direct talks with Iran starting Saturday about its nuclear program.

Implementation will begin on a staggered timeline, from April 15 through December 1. Some items, such as soyabeans and almonds, won’t be affected until December, following pressure from farmers concerned about animal feed costs.</p><p>US President Donald Trump had previously warned that if bourbon were targeted, he’d respond with a 200 per cent tariff on European alcohol.</p><p>EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, speaking ahead of the list being distributed to member governments on Monday, said the commission had taken national concerns into account. The result is a scaled-back response, covering fewer goods than the initial €26bn of US imports that were originally in scope after Washington’s blanket 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium.</p><p>“We’re not here to match move for move or dollar for dollar,” Šefčovič said.</p><p>EU governments are expected to sign off on the revised list by Wednesday.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump has declared plans for an additional 20 per cent tariff on all European exports.</p><p>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that Brussels has consistently offered the US a tariff-free agreement on industrial goods, especially cars, stressing that “Europe is always ready to strike a fair deal, and that offer remains on the table.”</p><p>Germany’s economy minister criticized what he saw as self-interested lobbying from fellow EU countries, saying the bloc should present a united front under the commission’s leadership on trade.</p><p>“Markets are already reeling, and the damage could escalate,” said Robert Habeck ahead of an EU trade ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. “We must act with clarity and unity—and that starts with recognising our strength and America’s vulnerability.”</p><p>“If each country defends its own niche—red wine here, whiskey or pistachios there—we’ll achieve nothing,” he added.</p><p>Still, Europe’s drinks industry will welcome the revisions if finalized. Many producers are already suffering from Trump’s original tariffs, a sluggish global market, and trade tensions with China.</p><p>France’s wine and spirits sector stood to lose the most from the planned duties, according to industry body Fevs, which warned that EU alcohol exports could fall by €1.6bn—half of that from France—impacting jobs and economic output.</p><p>“This trade dispute produces only losers, on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Fevs president Gabriel Picard. “Our longstanding US partners are sharing this concern with their own government.”</p><p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is expected to travel to Washington “in the coming weeks” as part of a broader EU effort to convince the US to walk back the 20 per cent tariffs, Italy’s foreign minister said Monday.</p><p>Antonio Tajani added that Rome’s goal is a mutual “zero tariff-zero tariff” agreement, but as a step toward that, hopes the US might at least reduce its reciprocal tariffs on European goods to 10 per cent.</p><p>The US spirits industry has also pushed back against global alcohol tariffs, highlighting that 86 per cent of American exports go to countries that have already eliminated tariffs on US spirits.</p><p>“The US spirits sector has long been a model of open, fair trade,” said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, last week.</p><p>In 2018, the EU imposed a 25 per cent retaliatory tariff on US whiskey, leading exports to fall by 20 per cent—from $552mn in 2018 to $440mn by 2021.</p><p>Following the suspension of those tariffs, US whiskey exports to the EU rebounded nearly 60 per cent, rising from $439mn in 2021 to $699mn in 2024, according to industry data.</p>","contentLength":4301,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jtxb0w/eu_drops_bourbon_wine_and_dairy_products_from/"},{"title":"Senator Warren Says Tariffs Putting US on Precipice of Recession","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSsnIRJgEzw","date":1744061467,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20188,"unread":true,"content":"<article>US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, criticizes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and says Congress needs to step up and put a halt to the Trump administration's tariffs on \"Balance of Power.\"\n\nSign up for the Washington Edition newsletter to find out how the worlds of money and politics intersect in the US capital: https://bloom.bg/3KkEimO\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

When staff, including the night manager, attempted to persuade the agent to return to his room, the agent became physically aggressive. Police were then called. The agent engaged in an altercation with numerous police officers, leading to his arrest. The agent was released from police custody later that day after intervention by the U.S. Embassy.</p><p>Four sources told the that Rubio’s protective detail is under severe strain and has been stretched to a near-breaking point by senior leadership. One source provided explicit examples of how resource stretches have led to vulnerabilities in protection. One State Department employee observed that “shift supervisors [on Rubio’s detail] have an incomprehensible workload. They are responsible for all the agents under them, scheduling, evaluations and a preposterous amount of admin work [as well as] performing the actual shift work. They work 6 to 7 days a week. I truly believe this [incident] was the result of incomprehensible strain [the agent] was placed under and, at the very least, [Diplomatic Security Service] owes [the agent] a very fair evaluation of these circumstances in their totality – looking deep into [DSS’s] own role [in what happened].”</p><p>A State Department spokesman told the , “The Diplomatic Security Service is aware of allegations of an incident involving an employee in Brussels, Belgium on March 31, 2025. While we don’t discuss specific personnel matters, the allegations are being examined.” The Belgian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment. Brussels police initially said, “Are you requesting confirmation of the arrest? Please note that we cannot provide details about the circumstances,” but failed to respond to follow-up inquiries. The Hotel Amigo and its ownership did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>DSS is responsible for protecting American diplomats and diplomatic compounds around the world and investigating crimes such as passport and visa fraud. But while once regarded as a highly prestigious law enforcement agency, DSS has suffered several embarrassments in recent years.</p><p>As the has reported, these incidents have included <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/1421771/agents-say-diplomatic-security-service-riven-by-mismanagement-and-failing-key-missions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">numerous leadership failures</a>. Field operations have also suffered. In December 2022, agents assigned to a full-time protective detail for former Trump administration U.S. Special Representative to Iran Brian Hook <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/735196/state-department-security-failure-former-trump-officials-car-stolen-and-used-in-dc-homicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">failed to prevent the theft</a> of two of his vehicles from his driveway. One of those vehicles was later used in a homicide in Washington, D.C. Four active or recently retired DSS employees have told the  they believe one problem is the tendency of more senior agents to refuse to join or support “hump agent” domestic protective details alongside more junior agents. Last November, DSS agents on a protection detail for U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy were <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3239657/diplomatic-security-service-agents-stop-serial-killer-ignored-leadership/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">instrumental in detaining a serial killer</a> in New York City. The agents responsible felt let down when leadership failed to give them due credit.</p><p>Further, unlike local U.S. law enforcement agencies supporting security at last summer’s Paris Olympic Games, DSS <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3103500/police-guns-paris-olympics-not-those-protecting-team-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">failed to secure authorization</a> for its agents protecting American athletes at the Games to carry firearms. DSS has also attracted controversy for <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/2867083/diplomatic-security-service-management-cuts-standards-and-drains-budgets-on-vegas-trips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"\">expensive diversity, equity, and inclusion-related trips</a> under former DSS Director Carlos Matus. Matus now serves as DSS’s senior-most official as the acting assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. Correspondence seen by theand conversations with both active and former DSS agents indicate that Matus has repeatedly failed to clarify for DSS personnel how their jobs and responsibilities may be affected by Trump administration policy changes. This includes a failure to respond regarding specific concerns raised by the DSS president for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.</p><p>There is no indication that the incident on Monday caused Rubio’s security to be compromised. </p><p>Still, it has reinforced sentiments inside and outside of DSS that it is only a matter of time until a protective mission failure occurs.</p>","contentLength":4336,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jtuhdt/brussels_police_arrest_rubio_security_detail/"},{"title":"Tesla's Future Determined by How Elon Musk Handles the Next 90 Days: Dan Ives","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJAu7ByJje8","date":1744055359,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20161,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Tesla's stock price dropped 9.2% to $217.41 amid a global equity market selloff, contradicting Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's prediction that it would never fall below a certain price again.\nThe decline follows a 40% price target cut by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, citing Trump's trade policies and a brand crisis created by Elon Musk, and a weak first-quarter vehicle delivery report.\nAnalysts have lowered their estimates for Tesla's sales and earnings, citing concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs, particularly in China, where Musk's association with the US president may drive consumers to prefer domestic brands.\n\nDan Ives, Global Head of Technology at Wedbush Securities, joins to discuss Tesla’s fall, big tech movers and his recent note: “Tech Investors Tariff Policy Creates Mass Uncertainty/Pain”\n--------\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\n \nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\n\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\n\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\n\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\n \nVisit our YouTube channels:\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake</article>","contentLength":1668,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sJAu7ByJje8?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Look at ETFs Amid Market Downturn | Bloomberg ETF IQ 04/07/2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhmxUuCr_9o","date":1744055146,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20160,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\"Bloomberg ETF IQ\" focuses on the opportunities, risks and current trends tied to the trillions of dollars in the global exchange traded funds industry.

Describing it as “a march towards independence,” Lagarde said Europe must build its own alternative to secure financial sovereignty. A fully unified capital market, she added, could pave the way for deeper fiscal integration — with a potential value add of up to €3 trillion annually.</p><p>Speaking on The Pat Kenny Show, Lagarde underscored Europe’s dependence on foreign digital payment infrastructure. “Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Alipay are all controlled by American or Chinese companies,” she noted, arguing, “We should make sure there is a European offer.”</p><p>Her comments come amid renewed focus on the Capital Markets Union (CMU) — a long-standing EU initiative aimed at creating a single capital market across member states. The goal is to improve the flow of investments and savings across the bloc, giving businesses better access to funding and citizens more efficient savings vehicles.</p><p>Lagarde linked progress on the CMU to broader economic integration, saying it could ease the pressure on monetary policy and lay the groundwork for a future fiscal union. While the claim of €3 trillion in annual added value stems from a widely cited Reddit post, more official estimates suggest a slightly more conservative impact. According to the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS), deeper integration could generate over €2.8 trillion in additional GDP by 2032, with at least €321 billion attributed to completing the Economic and Monetary Union.</p><p>Still, building a European alternative to Visa and Mastercard faces steep challenges. Among them:</p><ul><li>Lower interchange fees in Europe make profitability harder to achieve.</li><li>Massive upfront investment is needed to create infrastructure that rivals global players.</li><li>Adoption hurdles include shifting consumer and merchant behavior, and persuading banks to support a new system.</li><li>Technical complexity, especially around security, fraud protection, and cross-border compatibility.</li><li>Governance and coordination, as member states and institutions would need to align on execution and oversight.</li></ul>","contentLength":2251,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jtsera/march_to_independence_christine_lagarde_wants_eu/"},{"title":"LIVE: Hakeem Jeffries holds a press conference","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejZ41i2HA5I","date":1744049971,"author":"Associated Press","guid":20146,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Watch live as House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and other leaders hold a press conference in Washington, D.C.\n\n#live #news</article>","contentLength":128,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ejZ41i2HA5I?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Jamie Dimon Says Tariffs Could Hurt","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ4z6y8wexc","date":1744049767,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":20136,"unread":true,"content":"<article>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is urging a quick resolution to the uncertainties sparked by President Trump's tariffs.
