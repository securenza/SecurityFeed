Large professional drones spotted at five regional airports in Denmark disrupted flights and sparked a major police operation overnight.

The defense minister called it the ‚Äúmost serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date‚Äù and has reached out to NATO and the EU to discuss the incidents. \nDanish police said it was not possible to down the drones that were spotted at three airports and a military base, and that no one had been arrested. The incidents come a day after Copenhagen airport was shut due to drones, and follow a series of incursions of Russian drones and aircraft into EU airspace this month.  \n\n#Denmark #Drones #Droneincursions\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>","contentLength":1259,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/alXdILUUfl4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Zelensky Signals Readiness to Step Down After War Ends, Open to Elections During Ceasefire","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/60840","date":1758793752,"author":"/u/InsideIrene","guid":87497,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1nq2hym/zelensky_signals_readiness_to_step_down_after_war/"},{"title":"Thailand calls for troop cuts, de-escalation at Cambodia border | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvQuumaV_sA","date":1758793253,"author":"Reuters","guid":87422,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Thailand‚Äôs new foreign minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow calls for reduced troop numbers along the Thai-Cambodian border and stressed the need to uphold the ceasefire agreed by the two countries at the end of a five-day conflict in July.\n\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #thailand #cambodia #war \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3Ifumhl\n\nüëâ  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/vvQuumaV_sA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"UN General Assembly 2025 LIVE: World Leaders speak on day 3","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SWnPAin9SQ","date":1758792483,"author":"Associated Press","guid":87424,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Watch live as the 80th session of the U.N.

The main literature prize, endowed with 10,000 euros, even bore his name, the Klaus-Michael Kuehne Prize. That was until 2022, when two nominees for the prize withdrew because of Kuehne‚Äôs refusal to deal with his firm and family‚Äôs Nazi past, and the prize was renamed. Kuehne‚Äôs foundation felt it was ‚Äútreated extremely unfairly in the matter,‚Äù a spokesperson told the German newspaper  at the time. It soon stopped sponsoring the festival. It didn‚Äôt take place this year because the festival wasn‚Äôt able to find a major sponsor to replace the foundation.</p><p>Author Sven Pfizenmaier was the first of the two nominees to withdraw from the prize. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no fan of billionaires in general and billionaires who profited from Nazism, deny it, and whitewash themselves by funding art seems very bad, so that‚Äôs why I did it,‚Äù Pfizenmaier says by phone from Berlin.</p><p>‚ÄúWe believe that being open, honest, and transparent in everything we do will build trust with our stakeholders,‚Äù reads the opening sentence on Kuehne + Nagel‚Äôs investor relations page. When it comes to the company‚Äôs dark history, Kuehne is anything but open and transparent. In April 2015 a regional TV channel in Germany broadcast a short documentary about Kuehne + Nagel‚Äôs role in the furniture operation. Shortly before the film aired, Kuehne wrote to the channel director, asking that the outlet reconsider broadcasting the 22-minute documentary, because ‚Äúold wounds are being reopened.‚Äù</p><p>Kuehne‚Äôs brazen request, which was declined, came only months after he had shelved the Handelsblatt Research Institute study sources say he had commissioned for Kuehne + Nagel‚Äôs 125th anniversary.</p><p>In the run-up to the broadcast, the transportation firm published a defensive statement on its website. ‚ÄúLike other companies that already existed before 1945, Kuehne + Nagel was involved in the war economy and had to maintain its existence in dark and difficult times,‚Äù wrote the company in the German-only statement. ‚ÄúKuehne + Nagel is aware of the shameful events during the Third Reich and deeply regrets that it carried out some of its activities on behalf of the Nazi regime. The conditions under the dictatorship at the time and the fact that Kuehne + Nagel survived the turmoil of war with all its strength and secured the company‚Äôs existence must be taken into account.‚Äù It remains the sole acknowledgment to date by the firm about its Nazi activities. Other than the statement, Kuehne + Nagel‚Äôs website doesn‚Äôt mention the past, as it doesn‚Äôt have a history section.</p><p>While the firm has stayed silent on its past since 2015, Kuehne has since responded to the criticism that he and his company have not sufficiently addressed the company‚Äôs past involvement in Nazi crimes. ‚ÄúI would have understood if people had questioned these things 10 or 20 years after the war. Everything was still fresh in people‚Äôs minds then. The people who were responsible at the time were still alive. But to come back to it 70 years later. I find that strange,‚Äù Kuehne said in the  interview from January 2022. ‚ÄúAt some point, one has to let the dust settle on things. That‚Äôs my basic attitude. It‚Äôs important to learn lessons from what happened back then.‚Äù</p><h2><strong>V. THE TRUTH NEEDS TO BE TOLD</strong></h2><p>O Sunday morning in early September 2023, about 300 people gathered on the waterfront in Bremen‚Äôs historical city center. The crowd was there for the inauguration of a monument commemorating the systematic looting of European Jews by Nazi Germany through the practice of Aryanization. The memorial‚Äôs chosen location was no accident. High above the waterfront, overlooking the monument, towered the German headquarters of Kuehne + Nagel.</p><figure></figure>","contentLength":3814,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nq1ekd/the_richest_man_in_germany_is_worth_44_billion/"},{"title":"Italy sends second navy ship to escort Gaza aid flotilla","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-sends-second-navy-ship-escort-gaza-aid-flotilla-2025-09-25/?utm_source=reddit.com","date":1758789223,"author":"/u/Massimo25ore","guid":87653,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nq1csu/italy_sends_second_navy_ship_to_escort_gaza_aid/"},{"title":"Netanyahu leaves for New York to address the UN General Assembly","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdFhwpjlVAI","date":1758789120,"author":"Associated Press","guid":87414,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left for New York early Thursday morning for a trip that will see him address the UN General Assembly.\n\n#israel #netanyahu \n\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nRead more: https://apnews.com‚Äã\n\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home</article>","contentLength":329,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/FdFhwpjlVAI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Water shortage in Taiwan town as typhoon cleanup continues | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4_HnmZqCcU","date":1758788871,"author":"Reuters","guid":87409,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Residents of a Taiwanese town hit by Super Typhoon Ragasa face a water shortage as cleanup efforts continue.

The Sept. 28 election comes less than a year after a referendum on whether Moldova should pursue EU membership passed by a wafer-thin margin amid claims by the government of Kremlin interference.\nBloomberg reported this week that Russia has devised a plan to intervene in elections in Moldova and disrupt the government‚Äôs efforts to keep the country on the path toward European Union membership.\nThe multi-pronged strategy was finalized in spring and coordinated directly by the Kremlin. The goal is to undermine the chances of President&nbsp;Maia Sandu‚Äôs Party of Action and Solidarity in the Sept. 28 vote and ultimately see her removed from power, the documents citing the internal Russian plans suggest.\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

Another snag occurred when First Lady&nbsp;Melania Trump&nbsp;stepped onto an&nbsp;escalator&nbsp;at the New York headquarters and it ground to a halt, likely because a safety mechanism was triggered by someone in the US delegation, according to the UN.\nStill, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman suggested someone at the UN may have purposefully caused the&nbsp;escalator&nbsp;mishap. Now the Secret Service is investigating if both the teleprompter and the&nbsp;escalator&nbsp;were tampered with, according to people familiar with the matter. The seemingly minor episodes risked becoming a fresh source of friction after Trump blasted the UN as an ineffectual talking shop during his speech to the world body.\n‚ÄúI know that we have people, including United States Secret Service, who are looking into this to try to get to the bottom of it and if we find these were UN staffers who were purposely trying to trip up, literally trip up the president and the first lady of the United States, there better be accountability for those people and I will personally see to it,‚Äù White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday night on Fox News.\nIt was determined after looking at the&nbsp;escalator‚Äôs&nbsp;central processing unit that the&nbsp;escalator&nbsp;had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism was activated, according to a statement from UN spokesperson&nbsp;Stephane Dujarric.\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

The first was in 2019 when the mayoral elections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/turkey-orders-rerun-of-istanbul-election-in-blow-to-opposition\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">were annulled</a> on flimsy pretexts; voters returned to the polls and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/erdogan-faces-scrutiny-once-more-as-istanbul-goes-back-to-the-polls\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">handed us a victory</a> by an even larger margin.</p><p>But this year, democracy in Turkey has entered its most perilous phase. The process started in Marchon the eve of my nomination as the presidential candidate of the CHP, the century-old Republican People‚Äôs party. This was when my university degree was <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250318-turkey-university-cancels-erdogan-rival-s-university-degree\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">abruptly annulled</a>. Why is this relevant? Because, under the Turkish constitution, one must have a university degree to be able to run for president. Soon after, I was accused of corruption and ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/istanbul-mayor-arrested-ekrem-imamoglu-days-before-likely-presidential-nomination-erdogan-ntwnfb\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">aiding a terrorist organisation</a>‚Äù. For six months, I have been behind bars, arrested on politically motivated <a href=\"https://en.ekremimamoglu.com/freeimamoglu/the-arrest-of-ekrem-imamoglu-a-legal-review/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">corruption charges</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.turkeyrecap.com/p/secret-witness-how-imamoglu-and-many\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">‚Äúanonymous‚Äù witnesses</a>. In a country bound by the European convention on human rights, this is an outrage.</p><p>From mayors in <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/07/05/crackdown-on-turkish-opposition-intensifies-as-antalya-adana-adiyaman-chp-mayors-detained\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Adana and Antalya</a>, to municipal staff in Istanbul, repression has reached every level. Hundreds of people <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-detains-hundreds-erdogan-opponents-pursuit-octopus-corruption-2025-07-10/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">languish in prison</a>, including journalists, academics, businesspeople and students.Enes Hocaoƒüullarƒ±, a youth delegate to the Council of Europe, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/urgent-actions/release-arbitrarily-imprisoned-activist\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">was detained</a> for merely speaking out under Turkey‚Äôs vaguely worded laws <a href=\"https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/human-rights-defender-enes-hocaogullari-released-after-35-days-pre-trial-detention\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">on ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù the public</a>. This shows how far the crackdown has gone. His release, after protests at home and abroad, is a small but telling victory for democratic resistance.</p><p>Let me be clear about what is happening. In the arrogance of unchecked power, President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan is once more weaponising the courts against the democratic opposition. This time, opponents are being imprisoned and replaced with loyalists. Unable to shut down the CHP, the government is pursuing a case that will have the effect of erasing the CHP‚Äôs rising leadership by overturning <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-is-turkeys-main-opposition-party-facing-legal-crackdown-2025-09-12/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the outcome</a> of its 2023 national party congress. Earlier this month, a court moved to annul the CHP‚Äôs local congress in Istanbul, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-court-ousts-main-oppositions-istanbul-head-over-congress-irregularities-2025-09-02/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">remove its chair</a> and install a trustee.</p><p>The case against the CHP, which the government keeps dragging out in hopes of destabilising the main opposition and removing its legitimate leadership, marks a turning point in the effective dismantling of political pluralism. A system where judges replace elected leaders with handpicked stand-ins is no democracy at all.</p><p>Having hollowed out the republic‚Äôs institutions to build an authoritarian regime, Erdoƒüan now seeks to fabricate a compliant, hollow opposition. He intends to rewrite the rules so no genuine rival could survive, securing power in the style of Egypt‚Äôs Hosni Mubarak or Syria‚Äôs Assads. These are deliberate methods likely to be copied elsewhere tomorrow unless democrats everywhere stand together to resist them.</p><p>Erdoƒüan‚Äôs increasingly repressive tactics <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/10/16/turks-lean-negative-on-erdogan-give-national-government-mixed-ratings/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">expose his eroding popular support</a> and his desperate <a href=\"https://www.sozcu.com.tr/son-anket-sonuclari-aciklandi-akp-erimeyi-durduramiyor-p227922\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">bid to preserve power</a>. To avoid another defeat in the ballot box, he rewrites the rules. He relies on smear campaigns, corruption charges, efforts to divide the opposition and the ever-present ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù label. Yet, this display of power has further undermined his legitimacy, leaving him increasingly dependent on a narrow minority and the machinery of the state.</p><p>The people of Turkey are no longer deceived. Protests fill the streets, and polls consistently place CHP as the country‚Äôs leading party. Since 19 March, the day I was detained and jailed, millions of citizens, even in Erdoƒüan‚Äôs supposed strongholds, have been participating in peaceful protests to demand justice and change, despite the risk of arrest and police violence. This resistance reflects Turkey‚Äôs 150-year tradition of parliamentary democracy. But resistance alone is not enough.</p><p>That is why the CHP is preparing a comprehensive roadmap for democratic transition, to build a resilient and inclusive alliance: win elections; stabilise the economy; restore judicial independence; combat corruption and organised crime; expand social rights; rebuild trust in institutions; and redefine Turkey‚Äôs role in a changing geopolitical landscape.</p><p>Turkey‚Äôs fight for democracy, freedom and justice is not Turkey‚Äôs alone. If a nation whose experience proves that democracy is a universal project slides deeper into autocracy, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.</p><p>Yet I remain convinced: the will of the people will prevail. Our outrage in the face of injustices must be turned into a strategy. That strategy must involve building a new political culture and institutions that honour Turkey‚Äôs democratic legacy. If we achieve that, we will not only reclaim our democracy at home but help it rise again across the world.</p><ul><li><p>Ekrem Imamoƒülu is the elected mayor of Istanbul and the presidential candidate for Turkey‚Äôs main opposition Republican People‚Äôs Party (CHP)</p></li></ul>","contentLength":4882,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1npj9q1/i_was_elected_mayor_of_istanbul_but_i_write_this/"},{"title":"Zelenskiy tells UN: world in most destructive arms race ever | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyX-getfeTs","date":1758736459,"author":"Reuters","guid":87191,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on world powers to work together to stop Russia's war in his country, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of seeking to expand the fighting beyond Ukraine.\n#zelenskiy #unitednations #russiaukrainewar #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/46CJUUw\n\nüëâ  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":642,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/HyX-getfeTs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What Trump has said about Zelenskyy and Putin since his inauguration","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGNcNovc1Ks","date":1758736344,"author":"Associated Press","guid":87199,"unread":true,"content":"<article>President Donald Trump‚Äôs rhetoric toward both Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin has evolved since his Jan. 20 inauguration. \n\n#trump #putin #zelenskyy \n\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nRead more: https://apnews.com‚Äã\n\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home</article>","contentLength":341,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/jGNcNovc1Ks?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Ukraine's Zelenskiy attends annual Crimea meeting on UNGA sidelines","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBUgPKNUf8o","date":1758735120,"author":"Reuters","guid":87195,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends the annual meeting on Crimea on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n#un #unga80 #unitednations #zelenskiy #ukraine #crimea\n\nKeep up with the latest news from Climate Week: https://reut.rs/46whMCi</article>","contentLength":262,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/yBUgPKNUf8o?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Reuters NEXT Newsmaker with Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToDeUgdWgiY","date":1758735052,"author":"Reuters","guid":87194,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A pioneer of the global sustainable development agenda, Jeffrey Sachs has advised governments as well as successive U.N. secretaries-general on poverty reduction and climate action.\n&nbsp;\nAs director of Columbia‚Äôs Center for Sustainable Development, Sachs has championed clean energy investment, carbon pricing and debt relief tied to climate resilience, while also urging reforms at the World Bank and IMF to expand concessional lending.\n&nbsp;\nSachs sits down with Reuters Climate &amp; Environment Editor Katy Daigle during New York Climate Week to discuss the politics of net zero, financing for the energy transition and how to balance climate ambition with development needs in the Global South.\n&nbsp;\n#JeffreySachs #ColumbiaUniversity #Economist #ReutersNEXTNewsmaker #ReutersNewsmaker\n&nbsp;\nTikTok header: Reuters Newsmaker with Jeffrey Sachs\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/</article>","contentLength":912,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ToDeUgdWgiY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Micah Parsons says sacking his mentor Dak Prescott will be ‚Äòpainful‚Äô","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9RAACmCV-4M","date":1758734913,"author":"Associated Press","guid":87198,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Sacking Dak Prescott would be bittersweet for Micah Parsons.

Israeli strikes during the war targeted Iranian assets, highlighting vulnerabilities that Tehran is now moving to address. The new jets provide a boost while signaling Iran‚Äôs intent to rapidly modernize its aerial capabilities. The move underscores Tehran‚Äôs determination to rebuild its military strength and enhance deterrence amid ongoing Middle East tensions.</p><p>‚ÄúRussian MiG-29 fighter jets have arrived in Iran and are stationed in Shiraz, while Sukhoi Su-35 jets are also on the way,‚Äù Zohrevand said. He added that <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/china\">China</a>‚Äôs HQ-9 air defense system and <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/russia\">Russia</a>‚Äôs S-400 system were being supplied to Iran ‚Äúin significant numbers.‚Äù</p><p>Following recent clashes with Israel, Zohrevand emphasized that the MiG-29 jets are part of a broader effort to rapidly strengthen Iran‚Äôs air capabilities. The aircraft serve as an interim measure until Su-35s arrive, though <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/moscow\">Moscow</a> has not yet officially confirmed any shipments.</p><h3>Aging Fleet and Air Defense Gaps</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/iran-hits-back-at-trump-10479669\">Iran</a> has long struggled to modernize its air force, which still relies heavily on U.S.-made jets purchased before the 1979 revolution, supplemented by a small number of <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/russia-iran-nuclear-power-deal-update-tehran-moscow-2133679\">Russian </a>aircraft and domestically upgraded platforms. The country‚Äôs vulnerabilities were exposed earlier this year when Israeli strikes destroyed its last Russian-supplied S-300 air defense systems, which Tehran had acquired in 2016, leaving significant gaps in its protective network.</p><p>To compensate, Iran has bolstered its indigenous air defenses by developing the Bavar-373 long-range surface-to-air missiles, the Khordad and Sayyad missile systems, the Arman long-range anti-ballistic missile defenses, and the S-200 Ghareh long-range surface-to-air missiles.</p><p>Beyond its military buildup, Iran is seeking to leverage its growing capabilities diplomatically. Referencing the Cairo agreement signed earlier this year with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Zohrevand described the recent acquisitions as a ‚Äúvictory card‚Äù at a time when European powers were considering reimposing United Nations sanctions on Iran. ‚ÄúWe should not view this negatively; it strengthens our hand,‚Äù he underlined, suggesting that Tehran sees its expanding air and missile capabilities both as a deterrent and as a tool to strengthen its position in international negotiations.</p><p>Iran‚Äôs military modernization indicates additional deliveries of advanced aircraft and air defense systems in the near term, signaling Tehran‚Äôs intention to close capability gaps and enhance its aerial power. These upgrades could reshape the regional balance of power by complicating Israel‚Äôs operational planning and challenging U.S. influence in the Middle East.</p>","contentLength":3538,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1npd975/russia_delivers_mig29_jets_to_iran_air_force/"},{"title":"LIVE: Families of victims aboard American Eagle Flight 5342 hold press conference","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn_-JkXf-Rk","date":1758723081,"author":"Associated Press","guid":87042,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Watch live as the families of victims aboard American Eagle Flight 5342, along with their attorneys, hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., regarding the Jan. 29 mid-air collision with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter.

Others in the trial are still walking despite being expected to need a wheelchair.</p><p>Treatment is likely to be very expensive. However, this is a moment of real hope in a disease that hits people in their prime and devastates families.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Huntington's runs through Jack May-Davis' family. He has the faulty gene that causes the disease, as did his dad, Fred, and his grandmother, Joyce.</p><p>Jack said it was \"really awful and horrible\" watching his dad's inexorable decline. </p><p>The first symptoms appeared in Fred's late 30s, including changes in behaviour and the way he moved. He eventually needed 24/7 palliative care before he died at the age of 54, in 2016.</p><p>Jack is 30, a barrister's clerk, newly engaged to Chloe and has taken part in research at UCL to turn his diagnosis into a positive.</p><p>But he'd always known he was destined to share his father's fate, until today.</p><p>Now he says the \"absolutely incredible\" breakthrough has left him \"overwhelmed\" and able to look to a future that \"seems a little bit brighter, it does allow me to think my life could be that much longer\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Huntington's disease is caused by an error in part of our DNA called the huntingtin gene.</p><p>If one of your parents has Huntington's disease, there's a 50% chance that you will inherit the altered gene and will eventually develop Huntington's too.</p><p>This mutation turns a normal protein needed in the brain ‚Äì called the huntingtin protein ‚Äì into a killer of neurons.</p><p>The goal of the treatment is to reduce levels of this toxic protein permanently, in a single dose.</p><p>The therapy uses cutting edge genetic medicine combining gene therapy and gene silencing technologies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>It starts with a safe virus that has been altered to contain a specially designed sequence of DNA.</p><p>This is infused deep into the brain using real-time MRI scanning to guide a microcatheter to two brain regions - the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This takes 12 to 18 hours of neurosurgery.</p><p>The virus then acts like a microscopic postman ‚Äì delivering the new piece of DNA inside brain cells, where it becomes active.</p><p>This turns the neurons into a factory for making the therapy to avert their own death.</p><p>The cells produce a small fragment of genetic material (called microRNA) that is designed to intercept and disable the instructions (called messenger RNA) being sent from the cells' DNA for building mutant huntingtin.</p><p>This results in lower levels of mutant huntingtin in the brain.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Results from the trial - which involved 29 patients - have been released in a statement by the company uniQure, but have not yet been published in full for review by other specialists.</p><p>The data showed that three years after surgery there was an average 75% slowing of the disease based on a measure which combines cognition, motor function and the ability to manage in daily life.</p><p>The data also shows the treatment is saving brain cells. Levels of neurofilaments in spinal fluid ‚Äì a clear sign of brain cells dying ‚Äì should have increased by a third if the disease continued to progress, but was actually lower than at the start of the trial.</p><p>\"This is the result we've been waiting for,\" said Prof Ed Wild, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at UCLH.</p><p>\"There was every chance that we would never see a result like this, so to be living in a world where we know this is not only possible, but the actual magnitude of the effect is breathtaking, it's very difficult to fully encapsulate the emotion.\"</p><p>He said he was \"a bit teary\" thinking about the impact it could have on families.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The treatment was considered safe, although some patients did develop inflammation from the virus that caused headaches and confusion that either resolved or needed steroid treatment.</p><p>Prof Wild anticipates the therapy \"should last for life\" because brain cells are not replaced by the body in the same manner as blood, bone and skin are constantly renewed.</p><p>Approximately 75,000 people have Huntington's disease in the UK, US and Europe with hundreds of thousands carrying the mutation meaning they will develop the disease.</p><p>UniQure says it will apply for a licence in the US in the first quarter of 2026 with the aim of launching the drug later that year. Conversations with authorities in the UK and Europe will start next year, but the initial focus is on the US.</p><p>Dr Walid Abi-Saab, the chief medical officer at uniQure, said he was \"incredibly excited\" about what the results mean for families, and added that the treatment had \"the potential to fundamentally transform\" Huntington's disease.</p><p>However, the drug will not be available for everyone due to the highly complex surgery and the anticipated cost.</p><p>\"It will be expensive for sure,\" says Prof Wild.</p><p>There isn't an official price for the drug. Gene therapies are often pricey, but their long-term impact means that can still be affordable. In the UK, the NHS does pay for a ¬£2.6m-per-patient gene therapy for haemophilia B.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Prof Tabrizi says this gene therapy \"is the beginning\" and will open the gates for therapies that can reach more people.</p><p>She paid tribute to the \"truly brave\" volunteers who took part in the trial, saying she was \"overjoyed for the patients and families\".</p><p>She is already working with a group of young people who know they have the gene, but don't yet have symptoms ‚Äì known as stage zero Huntington's ‚Äì and is aiming to do the first prevention trial to see if the disease can be significantly delayed or even stopped completely.</p></div>","contentLength":6665,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1np9ix2/huntingtons_disease_successfully_treated_for_the/"},{"title":"Stocks Rise After AI Sentiment Boost; Trump Shifts Tone on Ukraine | Bloomberg Brief 9/24/2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFWHkNPepWM","date":1758712458,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":86977,"unread":true,"content":"<article>US equity futures rise boosted by Alibaba on announcing more AI spending and on a collaboration with Nvidia.

When Barack Obama tried and then failed to <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/01/lost-decade-us-economic-pivot-to-asia-defense/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">pivot to Asia</a> in 2011, sucked into turmoil in the Middle East instead, Europeans lulled themselves into the belief that their relationship with Asia could continue to be driven by trade, with security an afterthought.</p><p>Despite rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan strait, European governments viewed Asia, including China, through a predominantly economic lens. China‚Äôs belt and road initiative was initially seen as a purely economic endeavour, lacking strategic edge. It was only as US-China relations soured, under the first Trump administration and then especially under Joe Biden, that Brussels switched gears.</p><p>China was no longer seen only as a partner, but more warily, as a competitor and systemic rival. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_1532\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Investment screening</a>, tariffs and export controls entered the European lexicon when talking about China. The link to the US was clear. While the EU rejected any decoupling from China, considering it undesirable and impossible, it began advocating ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/eu-china-strategy-de-risking-ursula-von-der-leyen-brussels\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">de-risking</a>‚Äù instead. Once unpacked, this is no different from other trademark European concepts such as <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/733589/EPRS_BRI(2022)733589_EN.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">strategic autonomy</a> and economic security. But the timing and the framing of Brussels‚Äôs more hawkish line made it clear that its north star on China was Washington.</p><p>This worked so long as the transatlantic relationship was strong and Washington‚Äôs approach to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">China</a> was clear and predictable. None of that is true today. Toughening up to match China‚Äôs assertiveness, for instance, by accepting and even advocating for Nato‚Äôs role in east Asia, continues to anger Beijing.</p><p>But it no longer necessarily rallies favour in Washington. The Trump administration may bully Europeans to inflict costs on China, for example by applying secondary sanctions on countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas. But this does not guarantee that Trump will stand by Europe on Ukraine, or that Washington has any intention of exerting meaningful economic pressure on Beijing. So far, it‚Äôs China that has retained the upper hand in the trade war with the US. Trump treats Europe as subservient: he‚Äôs happy to see it inflict economic pain on Beijing at its own cost, but wants to avoid incurring such costs himself. As with most things Trump-related, it‚Äôs a toss of the coin whether he escalates or strikes deals with Beijing, naturally over the heads of European and Asian partners.</p><p>With Washington‚Äôs north star gone, Europeans are left figuring out what they actually think, and how they‚Äôll act towards China. Should they double down on trade protectionism to counter the negative impact on Europe of Chinese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/06/china-overcapacity-instability-home-and-abroad-rail-housing\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">industrial overcapacity</a>? Should they encourage Chinese technology transfers to the continent, avoid a trade war and jointly develop a strategy with Asia to save the global trade order? Should they embrace Chinese green tech, aware that proceeding with the energy transition and meeting climate ambitions is impossible without it, or try to dilute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/facing-dependence-on-china-eu-battles-to-support-green-industry\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">green dependency</a> on China? And in the global south, as the US exits from the development aid field, can the EU realistically counter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">China‚Äôs vast belt and road</a> initiative, or should it reconcile itself to its own ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/01/eu-infrastructure-fund-challenge-china-global-influence-asia-africa-eastern-europe-gateway\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">global gateway</a>‚Äù infrastructure initiative being complementary to it?</p><p>None of these questions have simple answers. Making them harder still are two underlying dilemmas that lie at the heart of Europe‚Äôs own future.</p><p>First is the future of liberal democracy in Europe. Democracy is under threat in the west. Far-right, nationalist and populist forces are on the rise, as is polarisation, radicalisation, disinformation and extremism, threatening fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the separation of powers. China, unlike Russia and the Maga movement in the US, does not explicitly back these far-right forces, nor does it appear to have any desire to export its model of government. However, given that China is the ultimate case of an economically successful authoritarian system, it inspires those in Europe who want to see their countries move in an illiberal direction. No wonder that China‚Äôs closest European partners are Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia, as was blatantly on display when their leaders (or, in Hungary‚Äôs case, foreign minister) attended China‚Äôs military parade in Beijing in September. When it comes to the magnetic draw that China exerts on authoritarian and illiberal forces in Europe, there‚Äôs not much European governments and institutions can expect from Beijing. The onus is on them to demonstrate that liberal democracy delivers.</p><p>The second dilemma regards security, and in particular the war in Ukraine. While China claims to be neutral maintaining ties with Kyiv and Moscow ‚Äì and, at least theoretically, supports sovereignty and territorial integrity ‚Äì in practice it sides with Moscow. President Xi Jinping‚Äôs no-limits friendship with Vladimir Putin is increasingly on display, and Beijing‚Äôs peace efforts on Ukraine have proved empty. In fact, China has visibly benefited from the war, not only through cheap Russian oil and gas, but especially strategically: Russia has become the junior partner in the relationship.</p><p>Europe cannot push China to turn its back on Russia, nor expect it to stop trading with Russia. But if China were truly neutral, it wouldn‚Äôt support Russia through the export of dual-use technology. If it genuinely wanted the war to end, it would exert pressure on Moscow, just like it did to mitigate Putin‚Äôs worst instincts when he irresponsibly threatened the use of nuclear weapons. Especially now that Trump‚Äôs failed diplomacy on Ukraine has revealed to all that it‚Äôs Putin, and Putin alone, that does not want the war to end.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/23/europe-china-us-superpower-ally-lost#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>When I was in Beijing this month, I argued that Ukraine now represents a core interest for Europe, and that China‚Äôs stance on the war is the biggest thorn in Europe-China relations. I said that it was not only a question of values ‚Äì on which, tragically, any remaining European credibility has collapsed since the Gaza war ‚Äì but of security interests. The replies I got were telling. Just as Europeans now view their relationship with China through the lens of Russia, China sees Europe through the paradigm of its competition with the US. Beijing believes that if worst comes to worst in US-China relations, Europe would stand with Washington, notwithstanding Trump and the US‚Äôs abandonment and betrayal of Europe. For China, I was told, keeping Russia on side is a strategic must. In the current circumstances Russia trumps Europe from Beijing‚Äôs perspective. It‚Äôs hard not to see the logic.</p><p>Russia represents a vital threat to European security and Europeans will bend over backwards to keep the US engaged in their defence. This is likely to fail ‚Äì regardless of how much flattery and self-abasement they offer to Trump. And while Europe could potentially confront Russia without the US, it cannot do so while China is in its crosshairs too.</p><p>This leaves Europe with no easy way out, but wishing the problem away is no answer.</p><ul><li><p>Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnist</p></li></ul>","contentLength":7410,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1np7uvf/europe_has_lost_one_superpower_ally_can_it_afford/"},{"title":"Israel closes main West Bank crossing into Jordan 'indefinitely' | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wQdNW8WGZc","date":1758706952,"author":"DW News","guid":86924,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Palestinian and Jordanian officials say Israel plans to close the West Bank Allenby Bridge Crossing \"until further notice.\" The Allenby Bridge Crossing, also known in Jordan as the King Hussein Bridge, is the only international gateway for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank that does not require entering Israel.

Taiwan has been hit hard by Ragasa, one of the strongest storms in years, which has already caused deaths in the Philippines and is now lashing Hong Kong. The storm struck Hong Kong early Wednesday with winds of up to 195 kph (120 mph), toppling trees, flooding coastal neighborhoods and forcing people to seek refuge in temporary shelters. Authorities reported at least 13 injuries and suspended flights, schools and train services. The storm also caused infrastructure damage as it ripped off the top of a pedestrian footbridge. The Hong Kong Observatory warned of a \"significant\" storm surge with \"two to three meters of rise in water level expected over the coast of Hong Kong.\" Earlier, the observatory issued the highest level of typhoon warning overnight.\nMeanwhile, Ragasa forced the relocation of more than a million people in southern China's Guangdong province. The storm is forecast to make landfall later on Wednesday between the cities of Taishan and Zhanjiang, the national weather agency said. Chinese authorities have ordered businesses and schools to shut down in at least 10 cities across the south. Ragasa has battered the region since Monday. In the northern Philippines, three people have been killed, with thousands displaced by floods and landslides, officials said. A lake burst caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa killed at least 14 people and left 124 others missing in eastern Taiwan, officials said on Wednesday.\n\n#Typhoon #ragasa #typhoonragasa\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>","contentLength":1971,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/7K7yWWy4QWs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Canada-US trade talks to move to USMCA review process: Carney | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNCeLoYY-5A","date":1758687473,"author":"Reuters","guid":86819,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that trade negotiations with the US were ongoing, and a lot of the remaining issues would move to a forthcoming review of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.\n \n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #markcarney #tradetalks #tariffs #freetradeagreement #usmca \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3IdyZbL\n\nüëâ  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":663,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/zNCeLoYY-5A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fans react after Jimmy Kimmel taping","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OHybCWF3xio","date":1758686879,"author":"Associated Press","guid":86817,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" audience members say the late-night host was emotional but didn't apologize when he returned to his show after a nearly weeklong suspension.\n\n#jimmykimmel #shorts #kimmel</article>","contentLength":191,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/OHybCWF3xio?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Audience says Jimmy Kimmel was emotional but didn't apologize on show's return","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCl7e0ogWdk","date":1758686443,"author":"Associated Press","guid":86816,"unread":true,"content":"<article>\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" audience members say the late-night host was emotional but didn't apologize when he returned after a nearly weeklong suspension.

On 11 September, the former paratrooper was sentenced to 27 years in jail for trying to stage a military coup after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.</p><p>But the South American leftist warned the global threat persisted. ‚ÄúAll around the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and suffocate freedoms. They worship violence, glorify ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,‚Äù Lula said.</p><p>US-Brazil relations have foundered in the lead up to the annual summit, with the US president slapping 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports as a result of what he called the ‚Äúpolitical execution‚Äù of his rightwing ally.</p><p>Twenty-four hours before Lula‚Äôs speech Trump officials announced new sanctions against Brazilian authorities, revoking the visas of the country‚Äôs attorney general, Jorge Messias, and six other officials. It also hit the wife of Alexandre de Moraes, a supreme court judge who presided over Bolsonaro‚Äôs trial, with Magnitsky sanctions usually used to punish the perpetrators of major human rights abuses such as war crimes or torture</p><p>‚ÄúLet this be a warning to others who threaten US interests by protecting and enabling foreign actors like Moraes: you will be held accountable,‚Äù , Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, said on X.</p><p>Lula hit back at the UN, telling delegates: ‚ÄúThere is no justification for unilateral and arbitrary measures against our institutions and our economy. Aggression against the independence of the judiciary is unacceptable.‚Äù</p><p>Speaking immediately after Lula, Trump accused Brazil of ‚Äúcensorship, repression ‚Ä¶ judicial corruption and [the] targeting of political critics‚Äù. But, unexpectedly, the US president left the door open to a reconciliation with his South American counterpart, who he ran into when arriving at the UN headquarters. ‚ÄúI saw him, he saw me and we embraced,‚Äù Trump said of Lula.</p><p>‚ÄúWe had a good talk and we agreed to meet next week ... at least for about 39 seconds we had excellent chemistry ‚Äì it‚Äôs a good sign,‚Äù added Trump, who made no mention of Bolsonaro in his speech.</p><p>The US pressure campaign has so far failed to save Bolsonaro‚Äôs skin. The 70-year-old politician is under house arrest and is expected to be taken into custody before the end of the year, with a maximum security jail in the capital Bras√≠lia one possible destination.</p><p>On Monday, Brazil‚Äôs government <a href=\"https://www.gov.br/mre/en/contact-us/press-area/press-releases/undue-imposition-of-the-magnitsky-act\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">voiced</a> ‚Äúprofound indignation‚Äù over the latest US sanctions, calling them an insult to ‚Äúa democracy that successfully defended itself against an attempted coup d‚Äô√©tat‚Äù and to ‚Äú201 years of friendship‚Äù between the two nations.</p><p>Trump‚Äôs pressure campaign also appears to have boosted Lula‚Äôs chances of winning a historic fourth term in next year‚Äôs election. Lula‚Äôs sagging approval ratings have rebounded in recent weeks, with the leftwing veteran positioning himself as a flag-waving patriot fending off the gringo threat.</p><p>‚ÄúBefore the eyes of the world, Brazil sent a message to all would-be autocrats and those who support them. Our democracy and our sovereignty are non-negotiable,‚Äù Lula, 79, told the UN assembly to applause.</p><p>In another indirect swipe at Trump, Lula criticised the recent US attacks on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 17 people. ‚ÄúUsing lethal force in situations ‚Äãthat do not constitute armed conflicts amounts to executing people without‚Äã a judgment,‚Äù Lula said, calling for the region to remain ‚Äúa zone of peace‚Äù.</p>","contentLength":3702,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1nov8jw/brazils_president_says_in_un_speech_that/"},{"title":"What is the H-1B visa, and what impact will Trump‚Äôs crackdown on it have?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d5aIKSkqujc","date":1758665307,"author":"Associated Press","guid":86763,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Trump administration‚Äôs abrupt decision to slap a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas has stunned and confused employers, students and workers from the United States to India and beyond.

General Assembly, President Donald Trump emphasized his new position that Ukraine can win back all territory lost to Russia during a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p></div></div></div></div><p>‚ÄúI think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúWith time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.‚Äù</p><p>The strengthened support from Trump, if it sticks, is a huge win for Zelenskyy, who has urged the American president to  on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war. It was a departure from  that Ukraine would never be able to reclaim all the territory that Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. </p><p>That had disheartened Zelenskyy, Europeans and Ukrainians and called into question the U.S. commitment to U.N. principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. But now, Trump‚Äôs view of the battlefield coincides more with Ukraine‚Äôs, Zelenskyy said.</p><p>‚ÄúTrump is a game changer by himself,‚Äù Zelenskyy told reporters after their meeting.</p><h2>Trump needles Russia about war in Ukraine</h2><p>‚ÄúRussia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,‚Äù Trump wrote on social media. ‚ÄúThis is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like ‚Äòa paper tiger.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>In his speech to the General Assembly, Trump said the  was making Russia ‚Äúlook bad‚Äù because it was ‚Äúsupposed to be a quick little skirmish.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt shows you what leadership is, what bad leadership can do to a country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only question now is how many lives will be needlessly lost on both sides.‚Äù</p><p>Before meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump said the ‚Äúbiggest progress‚Äù toward ending the conflict ‚Äúis that the Russian economy is terrible right now.‚Äù Zelenskyy said he agreed with Trump‚Äôs call for European nations to further halt imports of Russian oil and natural gas.</p><p>‚ÄúWe have great respect for the fight that Ukraine is putting up,‚Äù Trump told Zelenskyy, who replied that he had ‚Äúgood news‚Äù from the battlefield.</p><h2>How Trump‚Äôs stance has shifted on Ukraine</h2><p>Before his  with Putin last month, Trump repeated that any resolution to the war would require ‚Äúsome land swapping.‚Äù</p><p>Following those meetings, Trump announced he was  between Putin and Zelenskyy. But Putin hasn‚Äôt shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine.</p><p>European leaders as well as American lawmakers, including some Republican allies of Trump, have urged the president to dial up stronger sanctions on Russia.</p><p>‚ÄúIn the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly,‚Äù Trump told the General Assembly.</p><p>However, he repeated his calls for Europe to ‚Äústep it up‚Äù and stop buying Russian oil, the engine feeding Putin‚Äôs war machine.</p><h2>Push for sanctions and cutting off Russian oil</h2><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said before meeting with Trump that Europe would be imposing more sanctions and tariffs on Russia and that the bloc would be further reducing its imports of Russian energy.</p><p>Zelenskyy, speaking at a special U.N. Security Council session on Ukraine, also appealed for stronger U.S. pressure on Russia.</p><p>Russia denigrated the Security Council meeting as just the New York stop in the world tour of a ‚Äúformer actor,‚Äù a reference to Zelenskyy.</p><p>‚ÄúThere is no added value for the establishment of peace in Ukraine generated from today‚Äôs meeting,‚Äù said Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia‚Äôs deputy ambassador to the U.N. ‚ÄúThis will merely become yet another shameful episode in the market of hypocrisy.‚Äù</p><p>European leaders have supported Zelenskyy‚Äôs diplomatic efforts, with some alarmed by the possibility that the war  as they are facing what they have called Russian provocations.</p><p>‚ÄúI welcome the fact that the president of the United States believes in Ukraine‚Äôs ability not only to hold the course‚Äù but to prevail, French President Emmanuel Macron said.</p><p>Trump said he would back NATO countries that choose to shoot down intruding Russian planes, but said direct U.S. involvement would depend on the circumstances. </p><h2>New strikes in Ukraine as toll of war grows</h2><p>The full-scale war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, is taking a heavy toll on Ukrainian civilians. Russia said it shot down three dozen Ukrainian drones heading toward Moscow, while Ukraine said Russian missiles, drones and bombs killed at least two civilians.</p><p>The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also said this month that Ukrainian civilian casualties increased by 40% in the first eight months of this year compared with 2024, as Russia escalated its long-range missile and localized drone strikes.</p><p>A U.N. Human Rights Office report released Tuesday described the dire situation of thousands of civilians detained by Russia in areas of Ukraine it has captured.</p><p>‚ÄúRussian authorities have subjected Ukrainian civilian detainees in occupied territory to torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, in a widespread and systematic manner,‚Äù the report said.</p><p>Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. AP reporters Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.</p>","contentLength":5734,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1noqred/trump_says_he_now_believes_ukraine_can_win_back/"}],"tags":["news"]}
