It helps troops prepare for combat and train in realistic scenarios.</p><p> that shows the position of USS Iwo Jima, the ship where these live-shooting drills were happening. The imagery shows the ship less than 200km away from the coastline of Venezuela.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima is anamphibious assault ship that serves as a core component of US expeditionary forces, capable of launching amphibious invasions.</p><p>USS Iwo Jima was also seen accompanied by two other USS destroyers, within around 20km of each other.</p><p>The ship's arrival follows the announcement that the USS Gerald R Ford Aircraft carrier is also being moved towards the Caribbean Sea, with three US destroyers alongside it.</p><p>Sean Parnell, assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs, said in a statement on X on 24 October that the forces will \"enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle\" transnational criminal organisations.</p><p>He was thought to be describing fishing boats which they suspected of trafficking drugs, but so far there is no evidence to confirm this.</p><p>The deployment means there will be 14% of the US Navy's fleet in the Caribbean, showing a significant build-up of force.</p><p>USS Gerald R Ford was spotted just off the coast of Italy on its way to the Caribbean on 29 October.</p><p>Mr Cancian, senior advisor of defence and security at the Centre for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), told Sky News: \"The United States only has 11 carriers, three are at sea at any one time. So, moving one of them into the Caribbean is very significant, it does a couple of things. It puts more pressure on the Maduro regime, and it brings a lot of combat power into the Caribbean.\"</p><p>He described the USS Gerald R Ford as a \"use it or lose it\" asset, saying \"it's so powerful and so scarce, carrier strike groups, that other regional commanders will want to use the battle group\".</p><p>He added, when the airstrike carrier arrives in the Caribbean, a decision will have to be made.</p><p>\"If the administration wants to conduct strikes, the arrival of the Ford would open that window for those attacks,\" he said.</p><p>On 30 October, the Wall Street Journal reported that US officials said the Trump administration has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs.</p><p><strong>Is the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier the best military asset for targeting drug boats?</strong></p><p>Nick Brown, director at Janes defence intelligence company, told Sky News the \"Gerald R Ford is the US Navy's newest aircraft carrier and the largest warship currently in US service\".</p><p>He said there are 4,805 crew members on board and a full range of precision air-to-surface bombs, missiles and rockets, \"able to tackle a wide variety of tactical and strategic targets\".</p><p>The aircraft carrier also carries an abundance of fighter jets, typically 24 F/A-18s and 24 F-35s.</p><p>Mr Cancian said: \"It's not a very good asset for countering drug traffic. The strike aircraft are very powerful, but they move too fast to identify small boats. There are some helicopters that could help, but what the carrier is very good at is attacks against adversary military forces or targets ashore.</p><p>\"The strike aircraft operate at 500, 600mph. So, they're going very fast. And to spot a small boat and then to identify it, very difficult.\"</p><p><strong>Increasing pressure in the skies</strong></p><p>As well as the sea, the US appears to have been more active in the air over the Caribbean Sea. Flight tracking data shows the US have flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s.</p><p>The B1-B bomber is primarily a fast, heavy-hitting conventional \"bomb truck\" designed rapidly to deliver massive amounts of precision weapons, while the B-52 bomber is a versatile, long-range \"missile truck\".</p><p>Flight tracking data from 27 October shows two B1-B bomber jets flying over the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>\"The administration has flown bombers off the Venezuelan coast, B1s and B52s. So, they have been steadily increasing the pressure,\" Mr Cancian said.</p><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/download-app\" target=\"blank\" data-tracking-label=\"ui-app-promo-download-link\" data-type=\"\" data-component-name=\"ui-app-promo\" data-testid=\"app-promo\"></a><p>Three B-52 bombers were also seen on flight tracking on 30 October, leaving from Jacksonville (Florida) and Shreveport (Louisiana). They circled their surrounding areas for two hours before returning to their base.</p><p>The satellite imagery below shows six F35-B fighter jets, capable of performing air-to-surface, electronic warfare, intelligence gathering, and air-to-air missions simultaneously at Puerto Rico on 17 October.</p><p><strong>Uptick of strikes in the Pacific </strong></p><p>US Southern Command have been criticised for choosing targets in the Caribbean Sea rather than the Eastern Pacific.</p><p>Mr Cancian explained that \"much of the drug traffic that comes to the United States allegedly comes along the Pacific route... so not focusing on that flow\" was considered curious.</p><p>On 28 October, the US Southern Command defended their operational targets in a post on X saying: \"The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we're defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"</p><p><em>The Data X Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

She faced 16 candidates from smaller parties.</p><p>The October 29, 2025, election was marred by violence as demonstrators took to the streets of major cities to protest the vote and stop the counting of votes. The military has been deployed to help police quell riots. Internet connectivity has been on and off in the East African nation, disrupting travel and other activities.</p><p>The protests have spread across Tanzania, and the government has postponed the reopening of universities, which had been set for October 3, 2025.</p><p>Tanzanian authorities have not said how many people have been killed or injured in the violence. A spokesman for the United Nations (U.N.) human rights office, Seif Magango, on Friday (October 31, 2025) told a U.N. briefing in Geneva by video from Kenya that credible reports of 10 deaths were reported in the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam, alongside Shinyanga and Morogoro towns.</p><p>Tundu Lissu, leader of the Chadema opposition group, has been jailed for months, charged with treason after he called for electoral reforms that he said were a prerequisite for free and fair elections. Another opposition figure, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo group, was barred from running.</p><p>At stake for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM, party was its decades-long grip on power amid the rise of charismatic opposition figures who hoped to lead the country toward political change.</p><p>Still, a landslide victory is unheard of in the region. Only President Paul Kagame, the authoritarian leader of Rwanda, regularly wins by a landslide.</p><p>Rights groups, including Amnesty International, cited a pattern of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and extrajudicial killings in Tanzania ahead of the polls.</p><p>In June, a United Nations panel of human rights experts cited more than 200 cases of enforced disappearance since 2019, saying they were “alarmed by reports of a pattern of repression” ahead of elections.</p><p>Ms. Hassan oversaw \"an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents,” the International Crisis Group said in its most recent analysis. “The government has curbed freedom of expression, ranging from a ban on X (formerly Twitter) and restrictions on the Tanzanian digital platform JamiiForums to silencing critical voices through intimidation or arrest.” </p><p>The political manoeuvring by Tanzanian authorities is remarkable even in a country where single-party rule has been the norm since the advent of multi-party politics in 1992.</p><p>Government critics point out that previous leaders tolerated opposition while maintaining a firm grip on power, whereas Ms. Hassan is accused of leading with an authoritarian style that defies youth-led democracy movements elsewhere in the region.</p><p>But Tanzania is different, an outlier in the region. A version of the governing CCM party, which maintains ties with the Communist Party of China, has ruled Tanzania since its independence from Britain in 1961, a streak that Ms. Hassan extends with her victory.</p><p>CCM is fused with the state, effectively in charge of the security apparatus, and structured in such a way that new leaders emerge every five or 10 years. Ms. Hassan herself was able to rise to the presidency as Vice-President without incident when her predecessor, John Pombe Magufuli, died suddenly not long after the start of his second term.</p><p>The orderly transition sustained Tanzania's reputation as an oasis of political stability and relative peace, a major reason for CCM's considerable support across the country, especially among rural vote.</p></div><div><p> Published </p></div>","contentLength":3981,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ollhgc/tanzania_president_hassan_wins_disputed_election/"},{"title":"Donald Trump's nuclear testing order sparks pushback from Russia, China and the UN","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/trump-nuclear-testing-order-pushback/a21zghnl1","date":1761996239,"author":"/u/Ju0987","guid":103291,"unread":true,"content":"<div><b></b></div><div><h2 data-testid=\"embed-heading\">China, Russia express concerns</h2></div>","contentLength":30,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1olle13/donald_trumps_nuclear_testing_order_sparks/"},{"title":"Novi Sad, Serbia [1.11.2025]","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1oll9dn/novi_sad_serbia_1112025/","date":1761995780,"author":"/u/Rare-North-6202","guid":103231,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Novi Sad, Serbia, one year after the tragic canopy collapse crushed 16 people","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1oll8q9/novi_sad_serbia_one_year_after_the_tragic_canopy/","date":1761995717,"author":"/u/Landrayi","guid":103213,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mexicans honour the souls of children as Day of the Dead begins","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czxu20WihKo","date":1761995412,"author":"Associated Press","guid":103217,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The celebration begins on October 31, when families welcome the souls of children who have died, continues on November 1 with sweets and toys for the little ones believed to return, and ends on November 2, when adults are honoured with their favourite foods and drinks.\n\n(AP video by Martín Silva Rey)\n\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nRead more: https://apnews.com​\n\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home</article>","contentLength":466,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Czxu20WihKo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"More than 30 staff sacked at Grand Theft Auto developer in alleged ‘union-busting’ move","url":"https://www.thejournal.ie/gta-sackings-developers-6862061-Nov2025/","date":1761994312,"author":"/u/NilFhiosAige","guid":103280,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open.</strong></p><p>You are visiting us because we have something you value.

A proposal to oblige online platforms to scan private messages for images of child abuse will be made voluntary instead. The decision was announced by Danish Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard on Thursday evening.</strong></p><p>The European Commission launched the Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse (CSAR), commonly known as 'chat control' in 2022. Denmark, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, has made the protection of minors on the internet one of its focal points, and hopes to find an agreement before the end of the year.</p><p>However, earlier in its presidency, Denmark reinstated a proposal to require platforms and messaging services to use detection technology, including on encrypted apps such as Signal and WhatsApp, as part of CSAR. That decision sparked major controversy across the EU due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Several member states, including Germany, have described the plan as \"disproportionate\". Justice minister Stefanie Hubig has said that \"chat control without cause should be taboo in a constitutional state\". The European Parliament has also voiced strong opposition to the measure. </p><h3>Universal opposition in Belgium</h3><p>Belgium has not yet taken an official position on chat control. During a recent debate in the Chamber, Interior minister Bernard Quintin stressed the need for \"a balanced and proportionate solution\" that protects both privacy and the fight against child abuse.</p><p>Notably, not a single political party expressed support for the proposal during that debate. Open VLD MP Kjell Vander Elst called the measure \"totally disproportionate,\" while Vlaams Belang’s Barbara Pas said it would lead \"straight to a totalitarian control state\". </p><p>Denmark maintains that safeguards are included: only after judicial approval could a chat service be required to screen users’ images, with text messages excluded from detection. But N-VA MP Jeroen Bergers argued that even then, the measure remains \"a flagrant violation of privacy and letter secrecy\".</p><p>Due to the widespread opposition, the Danish presidency has now decided to back away from the controversial measure. Screening for images of child abuse would be voluntary rather than mandatory, Euractiv reported on Thursday evening. </p><p>With this change, Denmark hopes to reach an agreement, as time is running out to adopt new legislation. A transitional arrangement, under which internet platforms voluntarily screen for the dissemination of child sexual abuse material, expires in April next year.</p><p><sup>Danish Justice minister Peter Hummelgaard.

It just isn’t admitting as much","url":"https://theconversation.com/europe-is-allowing-itself-to-be-dominated-by-the-us-it-just-isnt-admitting-as-much-267060","date":1761961871,"author":"/u/Crossstoney","guid":103192,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For 80&nbsp;years, Europe maintained an asymmetric yet cooperative relationship with the United States. This imbalance, long accepted as the price of stability and protection, has shifted dramatically under US President Donald Trump. What was once a strategically uneven interdependence has become an unbreakable grip, which is used to exert pressure while being denied by its victims.</p><p>In my book, <a href=\"https://editionsdelaube.fr/catalogue_de_livres/latlantisme-est-mort-vive-leurope/\"><em>l’Atlantisme est mort&nbsp;? Vive l’Europe&nbsp;!</em></a> (Is Atlanticism Dead? Long Live Europe!), I describe this shift by introducing the concept of : a permitted grip in which Europeans, believing themselves to be partners, become dependent on a power that dominates them without their full awareness.</p><p> does not merely refer to influence or soft power, but an internalised strategic subordination. Europeans justify this dependence in the name of <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/european-gloom-over-the-trump-deal-is-misplaced-its-probably-the-best-the-eu-could-have-achieved-262369\">realism</a>, <a href=\"https://chairestrategique.pantheonsorbonne.fr/themes/2019/why-america-us-role-european-defense-and-european-mind\">security</a>, or economic stability, without recognising that it structurally weakens them.</p><p>In Trump’s worldview, Europeans are no longer allies but freeloaders. The common market enabled them to become the world’s largest consumer zone and strengthen their companies’ competitiveness, including in the US market. Meanwhile, through NATO, they let Washington bear the costs of collective defence.</p><p>The result? According to Trump, the US – because it is strong, generous, and noble – is being “taken advantage of” by its allies. This narrative justifies a shift: allies become resources to exploit. It is no longer cooperation, but extraction.</p><h2>Ukraine as a pressure lever</h2><p>The war in Ukraine perfectly illustrates this logic. While the EU mobilized to support Kyiv, this solidarity became a vulnerability exploited by Washington. When the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/us-resumes-military-aid-and-intelligence-sharing-as-ukraine-says-it-is-open-to-a-30-day-ceasefire/\">temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to US intelligence</a>, the Ukrainian army became blind. Europeans, also dependent on this data, were left half-blind.</p><p>The administration’s move was not a mere tactical adjustment, but a strategic signal: European autonomy is conditional.</p><p>In July&nbsp;2025, the EU accepted a deeply unbalanced <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_25_1930\">trade agreement</a> imposing 15% tariffs on its products, without reciprocity. The Turnberry agreement was negotiated at Trump’s private estate in Scotland – a strong symbol of the personalization and brutalization of international relations.</p><p>At the same time, the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/02/us-halts-ukraine-weapons-shipments\">stopped delivering weapons directly</a> to Ukraine. Europeans now buy American-made arms and deliver them themselves to Kyiv. This is no longer partnership, but forced delegation.</p><h2>From partners to tributaries</h2><p>In the logic of the MAGA movement, which is dominant within the Republican Party, Europe is no longer a partner. At best, it is a client; at worst, a tributary.</p><p>In this situation, Europeans accept their subordination without naming it. This consent rests on two illusions: the idea that this dependence is the least bad option, and the belief that it is temporary.</p><p>Yet many European actors – political leaders, entrepreneurs, and industrialists – supported the Turnberry agreement and the intensification of US arms purchases. In 2025, Europe accepted a perverse deal: paying for its political, commercial and budgetary alignment in exchange for uncertain protection.</p><p>It is a quasi-mafia logic of international relations, based on intimidation, brutalization and the subordination of “partners”. Like Don Corleone in Frances Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Trump seeks to impose an unpredictable American protection in exchange for an arbitrary price set unilaterally by the US.</p><h2> and imperialism: two logics of domination</h2><p>It is essential to distinguish  from other forms of domination. Unlike President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whose imperialism relies on military violence, Trump’s US does not use direct force. When Trump threatens to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trumps-greenland-bid-is-really-about-control-of-the-arctic-and-the-coming-battle-with-china-246900\">annex Greenland</a>, he exerts pressure but does not mobilize troops. He acts through economic coercion, trade blackmail, and political pressure.</p><p>Because Europeans are partially aware of this and debate the acceptable degree of pressure, this grip is all the more insidious. It is systemic, normalized, and thus hard to contest.</p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-people-are-fighting-and-dying-for-vladimir-putins-flawed-version-of-history-178925\">Putin</a>’s regime, by contrast, relies on violence as a principle of government – against its own society and its neighbours. The invasion of Ukraine is its culmination. Both systems exercise domination, but through different logics: Russian imperialism is brutal and direct; US  is accepted, constraining, and denied.</p><p>What makes  particularly dangerous is the denial that accompanies it. Europeans continue to speak of <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/02/03/remarks-by-president-antonio-costa-at-the-press-conference-following-the-informal-eu-leaders-retreat-of-3-february-2025/\">the transatlantic partnership</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/united-states-america/european-union-and-united-states_en\">shared values</a>, and strategic alignment. But the reality is one of accepted coercion.</p><p>This denial is not only rhetorical: it shapes policies. European leaders justify trade concessions, arms purchases, and diplomatic alignments as reasonable compromises. They hope Trump will pass, that the old balance will return.</p><p>But  is not a minor development. It is a structural transformation of the transatlantic relationship. And as long as Europe does not name it, it will keep weakening – strategically, economically and politically.</p><h2>Naming  to resist it</h2><p>Europe must open its eyes. The transatlantic link, once protective, has become an instrument of domination. The concept of  allows us to name this reality – and naming is already resisting.</p><p>The question is now clear: does Europe want to remain a passive subject of US strategy, or become a strategic actor again? The answer will determine its place in tomorrow’s world.</p><p><em>A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers.

He expresses concern about the lack of a clear strategy and warns that this could open a Pandora's box, especially in relation to China. Hodges also questions Trump’s strong focus on Venezuela, viewing the military actions as potentially aimed at regime change rather than addressing drug cartels. He raises alarms about Trump's intention to deploy military troops into U.S. cities, suggesting it could challenge military leadership. Additionally, Hodges shares a grim outlook on the situation in Ukraine, believing that Russia feels increasingly confident that Europe and the U.S. may give up on supporting Ukraine.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#trump #us #nuclear</article>","contentLength":1224,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/F88AwckXLOY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Virginia Giuffre’s brother says Andrew losing royal titles is 'true vindication' | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2R_jGTMiI","date":1761939867,"author":"Reuters","guid":103041,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, who accused Britain's ex-Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager, says he felt ‘true vindication' for his sister after King Charles stripped Andrew of his title.\n\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #virginiagiuffre #princeandrew #kingcharles \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4oQpw9S\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":666,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Ya2R_jGTMiI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"UN says hundreds may have been executed in seized Sudanese city | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVYoAh5R4ko","date":1761938789,"author":"Reuters","guid":103040,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Hundreds of Sudanese civilians and unarmed fighters may have been killed during the Sudanese paramilitary forces' capture of the long-besieged city of Al-Fashir, the UN human rights office said.\n\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #sudan #rsf #rapidsupportforce #hamdandagalo #alfashir\n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4qDle7q\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":639,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QVYoAh5R4ko?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SNAP Food-Aid Program Set to Run Out of Funding Due to Shutdown","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZnHrm17Bc4","date":1761938763,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":103046,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food benefits to more than 42 million people in 22 million households nationwide, could run out of funding on Saturday due to the government shutdown.

Donald Trump and Xi Jinping were all smiles at the APEC summit. But with India still facing the highest US tariffs, Modi avoided a chance to meet Trump at the ASEAN talks. On another front, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have literally joined forces — creating a mutual defense pact that some say could lead to an “Islamic NATO.” DW’s security podcast, Global Eyes, takes a look at these questions with India’s former foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal — and also discusses Delhi’s moves to court the Taliban — including a visit from the Afghan Taliban’s foreign minister to India and news India is re-opening its Kabul embassy. The visit came just as Pakistan and Afghanistan clashed over support to the Pakistan Taliban (the TTP). Our hosts also get input on this from former Pakistan senator, Afrasiab Khattak, who says Pakistan has been “lying to itself” about the TTP for decades.

Investigators spoke to military personnel and their families, and also studied complaints from the military prosecutor's office. </p><p>One example is Colonel Igor Istrati, a commander of Russia's 114th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, who allegedly ordered executions and torture of soldiers in his unit. He reportedly sent troops on assualts without weapons or equipment in an effort to \"nullify\" targeted soldiers. </p><p>\"You know, what's happening there is that... You never know where the bullet will come from: from your own side or from the Ukrainians,\" said Dmitry, a member of the brigade. </p><p><a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russian-armed-forces/\">Russian soldiers</a> have also been executed for refusing to participate in suicidal assaults, Verstka reported. One conscript, Alexei, described a commander ordering a subordinate to gun down any soldiers who refused to join an assault. </p><p>Their bodies \"were simply thrown into the river in their bulletproof vests so that they wouldn't float, or they were buried somewhere. That's the easiest way to get rid of them,\" he said.</p><p>Others reported similar stories of soldiers being ordered at gunpoint to join \"meat-grinder\" assaults and being executed by their own troops if they refused. </p><p>Soldiers also described <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russian-general-accused-of-running-torture-camps-dies-in-ukraine/\">torture pits</a> —&nbsp;basements and grated holes where servicemembers were beaten, starved, and even drowned. In some cases, soldiers reported being forced to fight one another in the pits for the chance to live. </p><p>The killings are primarily motivated by money, Verstka reported. Commanders sell the opportunity to avoid assault missions, demand bribes, and transfer salaries from contract fighters to their own accounts. Refusal to pay can result in being \"nullified.\" </p><p>Russia's ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine has relied on deadly \"human wave\" assaults, with Moscow incurring heavy <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russian-losses/\">personnel losses</a> for every inch of territory gained. The tactic is brutal but effective: Russian forces have steadily advanced in Donetsk Oblast, taking advantage of their superior numbers to offset <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/russias-summer-offensive-becomes-its-costliest-campaign-during-ukraine-invasion-economist-reports-06-2025/\">record casualties</a>. </p>","contentLength":2640,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1okufl4/zeroing_out_russian_troops_carry_out_torture/"},{"title":"Novo Nordisk cuts 9,000 jobs, eyes Metsera's obesity shot | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZhA8mB3ans","date":1761916656,"author":"Reuters","guid":102867,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Novo Nordisk has nearly finished notifying employees affected by 9,000 job cuts, as it faces heated competition in the United States, the world's biggest drug market, against rival Eli Lilly. \n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #wegovyweightloss #novonordisk #obesity \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3JELCgv\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":622,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/hZhA8mB3ans?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Global Oil Supply Will Keep Growing, Goldman Says","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ZStySo7FA","date":1761916566,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":102870,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Goldman Sachs Head of Oil Research Daan Struyven says the global oil supply will keep growing.

The destruction was one hundred percent,” Malyuk said.</p><p>“This is something we have never made public before… It happened before the name ‘Oreshnik’ was widely used.”</p><p>Ukraine’s intelligence estimates that Russia has fired one Oreshnik missile and destroyed a second, with at least one still in its arsenal. As Foreign Intelligence Service head Oleh Ivashchenko noted:</p><p>“There is one [launch system]… We believe that this year up to three were produced, and up to six are planned annually.”</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia may deploy the Oreshnik to Belarus, putting parts of Europe within its reach.</p><p>“We understand that their approximate range is 5,500 kilometers. And there is a dead zone of 700 kilometers. This means that Europeans, especially those in Eastern Europe, should pay attention to this. And everyone else, too. We must pay attention to these risks,” he said.</p><p>Russian state media has reported, without evidence, that the missile is capable of hitting any target on the European continent in under an hour and obliterating it with up to six independently maneuvering warheads each armed with an atomic munition.</p><p>Russia’s first, and so far, only confirmed use of the so-called Oreshnik missile was in an attack on the city of Dnipro on Nov. 21. The missile is thought by Western analysts to be a modified Soviet-era Soviet RS-26 Rubezh medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). It has a claimed range in excess of 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) and carries six nuclear capable or conventional multiple independently re-targetable hypersonic re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).</p><p>Earlier today Russia’s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu reportedly urged skeptics to “believe” in the development and successful testing of Moscow’s new “miracle weapons” – the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile and the Poseidon nuclear torpedo.</p><p>Speaking at the Peoples of Russia and the CIS forum, Shoigu reminded the audience that President Vladimir Putin first announced the creation of these weapons during his 2018 address to the Federal Assembly.</p><p>“Maybe someone didn’t believe it then, but now they will have to,” Shoigu <a href=\"https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2025/10/31/shoigu-prizval-poverit-v-nalichie-u-rossii-burevestnika-i-poseidona-a178947\">said.</a></p><p>On Oct. 26, Putin announced the completion of the “final tests” of the intercontinental Burevestnik cruise missile, describing it as having “no analogues in the world.”</p><p>Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov added that during its test flight, the missile, equipped with a nuclear propulsion system, traveled 14,000 kilometers and remained airborne for about 15 hours.</p><p>He said the missile’s technical features “allow it to strike highly protected targets at any distance with guaranteed precision.” Putin, in turn, ordered preparations for the missile’s deployment infrastructure within Russia’s armed forces.</p>","contentLength":3291,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1oksoe0/ukraines_spy_units_blow_up_russias_topsecret/"},{"title":"\"There's

however, data from Google shows searches for the site have decreased by almost half since the law came into effect.</p><p>This could be a consequence of people reducing their porn use but could also be partly explained by people visiting the site through alternative means such as a VPN, which masks a user's location.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Under the OSA, anyone accessing such websites in the UK now has to prove they are over 18 with age checks such as facial identification.</p><p>The firm's claim is the latest indication that people in the UK are changing how they use the internet since the Online Safety Act came into effect. </p><p>According to Ofcom, visits to pornography sites in general in the UK have reduced by almost a third in the three months since 25 July.</p><p>The regulator said the new law was fulfilling its primary purpose of stopping children from being able to \"easily stumble across porn without searching for it\".</p><p>\"Our new rules end the era of an age-blind internet, when many sites and apps have undertaken no meaningful checks to see if children were using their services,\" the watchdog said.</p><p>Ofcom told the BBC it believed the number of people using VPNs for general use reached 1.5 million daily in July, after the law came in, but has since decreased to around one million.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-usage-is-exploding-in-the-uk-heres-how-it-compares-to-europe-and-the-us\">research by Cybernews</a> counted more than 10.7 million downloads of VPN apps in the UK from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store across 2025.</p><p>\"It is likely that people not wanting to verify their age or identity to access sexual content, for example because of privacy concerns, are using VPNs to get around this,\" Dr Hanne Stegeman from the University of Exeter told the BBC. </p><p>\"As the location of website visitors are usually determined through IP addresses, it could be that those figures are inaccurate when a portion of visitors are using VPNs.\"</p><p>And Cybernews information security researcher Aras Nazarovas told the BBC people in the UK \"can and do\" use VPNs. </p><p>\"After age checks kicked in, VPN apps jumped to the top of the UK App Store, and at least one provider saw a 1,800% surge in downloads,\" he said.</p><p>\"So part of Pornhub's 'missing' UK audience hasn't vanished - it's being reclassified as non‑UK traffic.\"</p><p>But he said he believed \"the rest\" was indeed \"users shifting to sites that don't require age checks\".</p></div><div data-component=\"caption-block\"><figcaption>Age verification 'insurmountable task' - Pornhub exec</figcaption></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Alex Kekesi, an executive at Pornhub's parent company Aylo, told the BBC the new rules were unenforceable.</p><p>She said Ofcom faced an \"insurmountable task\" trying to get an estimated 240,000 adult platforms - visited by eight million users per month in the UK - to follow the rules.</p><p>This compares with the regulator taking action against fewer than 70 sites for non-compliance.</p><p>Ofcom says it prioritises sites to be investigated based on how risky they are and their number of users.</p><p>And Ms Kekesi claimed some pornographic sites have benefited from flouting the rules. The BBC has not independently verified this.</p><p>\"There are a number of sites whose traffic has grown exponentially, and these are sites that are not complying,\" she said.</p><p>Ms Kekesi also has concerns about the content on some of these sites.</p><p>She told the BBC of one which seemed to encourage users to search for content featuring girls below the age of consent.</p><p>Aylo says it has shared details of this and other sites with Ofcom.</p><p>The regulator has defended the way it enforces the new rules, saying increasing traffic to sites can be one factor that triggers an investigation.</p><p>\"Sites that don't comply and put children at risk can expect to face enforcement action,\" it told BBC News.</p><p>Ofcom's data shows that the top 10 most popular sites all have age assurance deployed. These sites represent a quarter of all visits to adult sites from across the UK.</p><p>It adds that over three quarters of daily traffic to the top 100 most popular sites are going to sites that have age assurance.</p><p>The government has also defended the regulator, and said protecting children online was a \"top priority\" for ministers.</p><p>\"Where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children, we will not hesitate to act,\" it added in a statement.</p></div><div data-component=\"subheadline-block\"><h2>Should devices do the checks?</h2></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Ms Kekesi spoke to the BBC while in the UK for a meeting with Ofcom and government officials, where she has been making Pornhub's case that age checks should be done at device level, rather than by individual websites.</p><p>She said the UK stands out in having persuaded the platform to introduce age checks.</p><p>A number of jurisdictions have sought to compel Pornhub to check its users' ages, but the response of the site has been to block users rather than comply.</p><p>Ms Kekesi said the UK was different because it allowed sites to offer a range of different solutions, meaning that Pornhub could use methods - such as email-based checks - which didn't require collecting biometric data.</p><p>She denied that the threat of hefty fines for non-compliance had been the primary motive for complying, pointing to the contrast with France - its second biggest market - where it had cut off access rather than agreeing to what regulators demanded.</p><p>Ian Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association rejected calls for a switch to device-based verification.</p><p>But he added the group shared a desire for a \"level playing field\" meaning age checks should be \"robust, not superficial or fake\". </p><p>Chelsea Jarvie, a cybersecurity company founder who has been researching methods of age assurance for a PhD at Strathclyde University, told the BBC both approaches to age checks would be needed - with neither age verification on platforms nor devices being a \"silver bullet\".</p><p>\"For somebody to truly be safe online we need different layers of controls throughout their browsing journey,\" she said.</p></div>","contentLength":6030,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1okreie/pornhub_says_uk_visitors_down_77_since_age_checks/"},{"title":"What to know about where things stand with the war in Sudan","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5xS16Bgfeo4","date":1761907582,"author":"Associated Press","guid":102794,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Sudan’s brutal two-year war has entered a new, dangerous phase.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces seized control of the entire Darfur region, after ousting the Sudanese army from its last stronghold there.

[YONHAP]</p></div>   Two North Korean prisoners of war in Ukraine, captured while fighting for Russia and detained since early 2025, have pleaded with a visiting documentary producer to bring them to South Korea, an activist said Friday.  <p>    Jang Se-yul, head of a North Korean defectors' group in South Korea, disclosed the meeting between two North Korean captives in their 20s and a South Korean documentary producer Tuesday at a prisoner camp near Kyiv, Ukraine, where they are currently held.  </p>    The North Korean soldiers first came to media attention when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote online in January that they had been captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia's western Kursk region while in battle.  <p>    \"Please bring [us] to South Korea,\" Jang quoted them as telling the producer, weeping.  </p><p>    Both of them expressed a desire to go to South Korea, Jang suggested, a change from February, when only one of them had expressed such an intent during a </p><a href=\"https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-03-04/national/northKorea/Lawmaker-details-discussions-on-defection-with-North-Korean-POWs-in-Ukraine/2254441\" target=\"_blank\">meeting with South Korean lawmaker </a>Yu Yong-weon.  <p>   The soldier had expressed a desire to have a home and start a family in the South, according to Yu. Sending the soldiers back to the North would be a \"death sentence,\" the lawmaker said.  </p><p>    Provided photos showed that the jaw wound sustained by one of them at the time of capture was now healed, though it had left some bone distortion. Otherwise, they appeared to be in a relatively healthy state.  </p><p>    Hand-drawn portraits of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were hung on the bed of one of them.  </p><div><p>A North Korean prisoner of war meets with producer Kim Young-mi at a prisoner camp in Ukraine on Oct. 28 in this photo provided by an activist group on Oct. 30.

were in a state of psychological instability and had attempted to harm themselves.  <p>   South Korea has notified the Ukrainian government of its intent to receive the North Korean captives if their intentions were confirmed, but no progress appears to be underway on their transfer.&nbsp;  </p><p>   North Korea has deployed 15,000 troops to fight alongside Russia in its war with Ukraine since October last year, as the two states forge increasingly close military ties.  </p><p>   Some 600 North Korean soldiers are believed to have been killed while fighting for Russia, and more than 4,000

Since the city fell to the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Sunday, the doctors have been kidnapped and reports have emerged of a massacre at the hospital.</p><p>\"On 28 October, six health workers, four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist, were abducted,\" from the hospital, the World Health Organization said in a statement Wednesday. \"On the same day, more than 460 patients and their companions were reportedly shot and killed in the hospital.\"</p><p>WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"deeply shocked\" and \"appalled\" by the massacre and called for health facilities, health workers and patients to be protected under international law.</p><p>\"Prior to this latest attack, WHO has verified 185 attacks on health care in Sudan with 1204 deaths and 416 injuries of health workers and patients since the start of the conflict in April 2023,\" he said.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Satellite image of Saudi hospital in el-Fasher before RSF attacks, 26th Oct. 2025.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Satellite image ©2025 Vantor\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Satellite images of Saudi hospital in el-Fasher after the RSF attacks.

While they cannot be independently verified by NPR, they show militia men walking through the ransacked wards, stepping over piles of dead bodies and shooting anyone left alive at point blank range.</p><p>RSF leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has pledged to investigate the allegations of war crimes by his soldiers in el-Fasher - but many doubt his sincerity, as he has failed to investigate previous atrocities.</p><p>Since overtaking el-Fasher– which they had besieged for over 500 days – and chasing out the Sudanese army, videos, <a href=\"https://x.com/HRL_YaleSPH/status/1983362959385780473\" target=\"_blank\">satellite imagery</a>, and testimony from those who've managed to flee indicate the RSF has been pursuing a scorched earth policy in the Darfuri city.</p><p>The RSF has been fighting the national army for control of the resource-rich nation that sits at the vital crossroads between North Africa, the Sahel, and the Red Sea in a bloody civil war since 2023.</p><p>The group emerged from the janjaweed militia that terrorized Darfur in the early 2000s and was accused of genocide. The US has already accused the RSF and allied Arab militias of committing genocide against African ethnic groups in the current conflict.</p><p>The situation in el-Fasher was dire even before the RSF overran it this week. The year and a half long blockade of some 250,000 civilians has led to starvation and famine.</p><p>The UN's migration organization says 26,000 people have managed to flee since the takeover. Many of those are arriving seeking help in the town of Tawila, in north Darfur, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders is running the closest health point.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders used to provide support to the Saudi hospital but stopped operating in el-Fasher in August 2024 saying it had become too dangerous.</p><p>On Wednesday the NGO said people arriving at Tawila were showing \"extremely alarming levels of malnutrition among women and children, which is indicative of a famine-like situation.\"</p><p>The organization's International president Dr Mohamed Javid Abdelmoneim noted however, that very few adult men were arriving, and said this raised concerns about ethnically targeted violence.</p><p>\"This is testament to the horror unfolding in and around the city,\" he said.</p><p>One mother of six, who had fled el-Fasher but didn't wish to be named to protect her identity, told aid workers from international NGO Save the Children what they had endured.</p><p>\"We hid the children in trenches, and we ran into abandoned buildings during the attacks. After that, we just ate umbaz (animal feed),\" she said.</p><p>Another woman described the long trek to safety, during which she was beaten and robbed by a gang.</p><p>\"We lost family members, we lost neighbors, we lost everyone,\" she recounted. \"We've been walking for the past four days from el-Fasher. A group of motorbike riders met us on the way…They killed people and insulted us a lot.\"</p><p>The UN Security Council held a meeting on the crisis Thursday.</p><p>The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said the violence recalls the horrors of the genocide in Darfur two decades ago.</p><p>\"But what is different today, we are seeing a different global reaction. One of resignation,\" he said. \"So this is also a crisis of apathy.\"</p>","contentLength":5760,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1okjfob/hundreds_killed_in_darfur_hospital_massacre_hero/"},{"title":"Jamaicans scramble for basic items after direct hit from Hurricane Melissa","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaheLfIasdA","date":1761878764,"author":"Associated Press","guid":102596,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Residents of Black River in Western Jamaica were scrambling to find basic items on Thursday, after the eye of Hurricane Melissa crossed their town during it's landfall.
