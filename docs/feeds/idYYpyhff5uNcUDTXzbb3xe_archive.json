Now prosecutors also wish to charge him under a law that makes it a criminal offence to “publicly and contrary to the facts deny” Nazi or communist crimes.</p><p>“There is and will be no consent to distorting history and breaking the law,” wrote justice minister Waldemar Żurek, announcing on Friday that he had asked the European Parliament to lift Braun’s immunity.</p><p>“This is a question of historical truth, respect for the victims, and accountability for one’s words,” added Żurek, who also serves as prosecutor general. “The Polish state has a duty to respond to the denial of Nazi-German crimes.”</p><p>Żurek revealed that the accusation against Braun relates to “denial of genocide crimes committed by functionaries of the Third Reich in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and the Lublin concentration camp (Majdanek)”.</p><p>In a further statement, Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), a state historical body that has prosecutorial power, said that the accusation related to the use of gas chambers at those two camps.</p><p>Neither the IPN nor Żurek confirmed what specific words Braun had said that prompted the planned charges against him. However, the IPN noted that they had come at a live event broadcast online on 27 September 2025.</p><p>On that date, Braun took part in a discussion with Jan Żaryn, a right-wing historian and former senator for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, titled “The Polish Underground State and the Jewish Issue”. A&nbsp;recording of the event is still available online.</p><p>During his remarks, Braun referred to the “fake gas chambers of Majdanek and Auschwitz”, calling them “a dark, monstrous fantasy that has no satisfactory historical or academic support”.</p><p>He suggested that the idea of the gas chambers had been invented as part of “propaganda and black PR operations conducted by the Soviet and Anglo-Saxon security services during World War Two”, and that the false claim continues to be exploited by Jews today.</p><p>In actual fact, historians estimate that around 900,000 people were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. The vast majority were Jews, but victims also included Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and ethnic Poles.</p><p>Meanwhile, gas chambers at Majdanek were used to kill tens of thousands, again mainly Jews.

With 1.5 billion euros per week in VAT revenue at stake, there are now serious concerns about digital sovereignty.</b></p><p>If that revenue of €1.5B a week disappears, the state will have to quickly borrow more on the international capital market. In theory, America could stop this process in the Netherlands thanks to a new tender, <a href=\"https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/btw-as-an-american-service/\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> Dutch tech commentator Bert Hubert.</p><p>Last year, FAST Enterprises won a <a href=\"https://www.computable.nl/2025/02/18/capgemini-daagt-staat-om-nieuw-systeem-omzetbelasting/\" target=\"_blank\">€190 million tender for</a> the renewal of VAT processing. However, the tender documents show that the American company is not only supplying software. FAST will also supply the servers, manage the software, and provide maintenance. And all of this will be done remotely, from the US. With BTW being the local term for VAT, Hubert calls the current situation “BTW-as-a-service” due to the lack of control.</p><p>The “turnkey solution” as described in the tender includes equipment, system software, configuration, maintenance, and management. The new solution will also have access to 20 to 25 other applications within the Tax and Customs Administration. It is unclear exactly which ones these are; they could be purchased systems or locally developed applications (LOAs).</p><p>Given that the tender process has been ongoing for years, it is clear that the choice of an American IT supplier was made without knowledge of the current geopolitical tensions. Criticism has been coming from various quarters, logically including competitors for the tender, for some time now. However, the Tax and Customs Administration is said to have ensured that it runs independently within the Netherlands, although concrete evidence of the complete autonomy of the purchased system is not yet available.</p><p>The alternative would have been SAPTRM from SAP, implemented by Capgemini, which is well known to the tax authorities. A 2022 report by McKinsey compared this solution with that of FAST Enterprises, but it is now offline. In it, the latter solution, which was ultimately chosen, would have emerged as the winner.</p><p>According to the ICT Assessment Advisory Board, the preparations for this transition were insufficient in <a href=\"https://www.adviescollegeicttoetsing.nl/documenten/2024/04/02/bit-advies-modernisering-omzetbelasting\" target=\"_blank\">April 2024</a>. The management was said to have been too weak, the need for the solution insufficiently clear, and above all, the preparation for the decision-making process was deemed ‘insufficiently careful’. In <a href=\"https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2025:3645\" target=\"_blank\">March 2025</a>, the court ruled that the award to FAST was justified after Capgemini had filed a lawsuit.</p><p>The acquisition of Solvinity by the American company Kyndryl sparked the controversy surrounding digital sovereignty at the beginning of this year. Because <a href=\"https://www.techzine.eu/news/privacy-compliance/138159/regulator-investigates-kyndryls-acquisition-of-dutch-solvinity/\">Solvinity</a> manages the DigiD system for civil affairs on behalf of the government, dependence on the United States via the former IBM component Kyndryl would be risky. Exactly how much control Washington has is unclear, especially since the outsourcing of DigiD may eventually be relocated.</p><p>In short, what is now happening with FAST Enterprises seems to be repeating the controversy surrounding Solvinity. Although the details are completely different, the importance of the government’s digital autonomy remains at stake. The expressed concerns about decision-making and the lack of transparency about the exact control exercised by the Tax and Customs Administration make the issue highly debatable. This is clear even without the knowledge of 2026.</p>","contentLength":3452,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rhr0lt/dutch_tax_authority_hands_us_software_company/"},{"title":"LIVE: Middle East airspace after US and Israel launch attack on Iran","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UbLaYw1RlE","date":1772347098,"author":"Associated Press","guid":155154,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Watch a live view of the flight radar map as Israel, Iraq and Iran closed their airspaces following the U.S. and Israel's attack on Iran.\n\nCredit: Flightradar24</article>","contentLength":160,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2UbLaYw1RlE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Aftermath of Iranian strike in Tel Aviv","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI_b2ExZXgE","date":1772346961,"author":"Reuters","guid":155149,"unread":true,"content":"<article>View of damage to buildings at the site where a woman was killed and more than 20 wounded during an Iranian rocket attack into central Israel following US and Israeli strikes on Iran on February 28.

Ambassador Danny Danon defended the airstrikes as necessary to stop an existential threat.</p><p>“We are stopping extremism before it becomes unstoppable,” he said. “We will ensure that no radical regime armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles can threaten our people or the entire world.”</p><p>Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the U.N., told the council that the airstrikes have killed and injured hundreds of Iranian civilians, which he called a war crime and a crime against humanity. </p><p>He blasted the U.N. and the Security Council, its most powerful body, for not heeding Tehran’s warnings about the “warmongering statements” by the U.S. in recent weeks and urged the council to act now.</p><p>“The issue before the council is straightforward: whether any member state may, including a permanent member of this council, through the use of force, coercion or aggression, determine the political future or system of another state or impose control over its affairs,” Iravani said.</p><p>During his speech, the Iranian diplomat did not mention or comment on President Donald Trump’s statement that Supreme Leader Ayatollah  was killed in the strikes, although Iranian state media later confirmed his death. The assassination of the second leader of the Islamic Republic, who had no designated successor, raised the prospects of a protracted conflict given Iranian threats of retaliation. </p><h2>Iranian and US ambassadors have tense back-and-forth</h2><p>In a rare exchange, the U.S. and Iranian ambassadors traded warnings and direct rebuffs toward the end of the emergency session as military aggression between their countries risked spilling into a regional war.</p><p>After Waltz responded to Iranian claims that the U.S. had violated international law, Iravani asked to speak again to issue a warning: “I advise to the representative of the United States to be polite. It will be better for yourself and the country you represent.”</p><p>Waltz responded immediately, saying, “This representative sits here, in this body, representing a regime that has killed tens of thousands of its own people, and imprisoned many more, simply for wanting freedom from your entire tyranny.”</p><h2>Other Security Council members speak up</h2><p>Russia’s ambassador condemned the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes, while China’s ambassador was more measured in his criticism. </p><p>“We demand that the United States and Israel immediately cease their aggressive actions,” Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. “We insist on the immediate resumption of political and diplomatic settlement efforts … based on international law, mutual respect and a balance of interests.”</p><p>China’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong said China was very concerned by “the sudden escalation of regional tensions” and supported Russia’s call for a return to diplomatic negotiations. </p><p>The permanent observer of the 22-nation Arab League, Maged Abdelaziz, suggested Israel was being hypocritical in justifying its military attack by saying it was intended to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Abdelaziz, a former Egyptian ambassador to the U.N., noted that Israel has refused to subject its own nuclear facilities to inspection by the U.N. nuclear watchdog. </p><p>The emergency meeting was called by five council members: Bahrain, which is the Arab representative on the council, France, Russia, China and Colombia,.</p><p>In a joint statement, the leaders of Britain and France — both veto-wielding members of the council — along with Germany’s chancellor called for a resumption of U.S.-Iranian talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. The three countries, part of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have led efforts to reach a negotiated solution. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018.</p><p>The three European leaders strongly condemned Iranian airstrikes in the region — not the U.S.-Israeli airstrikes — and urged Iran’s leaders to seek a negotiated solution, saying: “Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future.”</p><p>The Security Council meeting is taking place on the last day of the United Kingdom’s presidency and a day before the United States takes over the rotating presidency for the month of March.</p><p>Amiri reported from Atlanta.</p>","contentLength":5368,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rhn05f/us_and_israel_clash_with_iran_at_emergency/"},{"title":"An historic day in Iran: Ayatollah Khamenei is dead","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y8025Rw05g","date":1772336386,"author":"Reuters","guid":155146,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Listen to our correspondents discuss the latest developments in Iran including the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Satellite photos from Airbus showed that the site was heavily bombed. </p><p>His death at his office “showed that he consistently stood among the people and at the forefront of his responsibilities, confronting what officials call global arrogance,” state TV said. </p><p>“Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote in a social media post. He warned of “heavy and pinpoint bombing” that he said would continue throughout the week and even beyond, part of a lethal assault the U.S. has justified as necessary to disable .</p><p>Iran, which responded to the strikes with its own counterassault, warned of retribution, with the Cabinet saying that this “great crime will never go unanswered.” The paramilitary Revolutionary Guard threatened to launch its “most intense offensive operation” ever targeting Israeli and American bases.</p><p>The killing of Khamenei in  on Iran in eight months appeared certain to create a leadership vacuum given the absence of a known successor and because  had final say on all major policies during his decades in power.

Maj. Gen. Mohammad Pakpour took over as the Guard’s top commander after Israel killed its past commander in the 12-day war last June. The adviser, Ali Shamkhani, had long been a figurehead within Iran’s security establishment, IRNA said.</p><p>As reports trickled out about Khamenei’s death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, cheering from rooftops, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.</p><p>Mourners raised a black mourning flag over the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city and a major pilgrimage site for Shiite Muslims. The Iranian government declared 40 days of public mourning and a seven-day nationwide public holiday to commemorate Khamenei’s death.</p><p>Citing unidentified sources, the semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to the Revolutionary Guard, reported that several relatives of Khamenei were also killed, including a daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and grandchild.</p><h2>Strikes were planned for months</h2><p>The joint U.S.-Israel operation, which officials say was planned for months, took place Saturday during the Muslim holy fasting  and at the start of the Iranian workweek. It followed stilted negotiations and warnings from Trump, who last year trumpeted his administration’s success in incapacitating the country’s nuclear program but nonetheless cast the latest round as necessary to head off its potential resurgence.</p><p>About 12 hours after the attacks began, the U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases despite “hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.” It said targets in Iran included Revolutionary Guard command facilities, air defense systems, missile and drone launch sites, and military airfields.</p><p>Israel, for its part, said it had killed the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps and the country’s defense minister, as well as the secretary of the Iranian Security Council, a close adviser to Khamenei.</p><p>Khamenei “was unable to avoid our Intelligence and Highly Sophisticated Tracking Systems and, working closely with Israel, there was not a thing he, or the other leaders that have been killed along with him, could do,” Trump said. “This is the single greatest chance for the Iranian people to take back their Country.”</p><p>An Iranian diplomat  that hundreds of civilians were killed and wounded in the strikes.

The official said intelligence showed that Iran had developed the capability to produce its own high-quality centrifuges, an important step in developing the highly enriched uranium needed for weapons.</p><p>Iran responded to the latest strikes by launching missiles and drones  and targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The Israeli military said Iran fired dozens of missiles at Israel, with many intercepted. The Magen David Adom rescue service said Saturday night that a woman in the Tel Aviv area died after being wounded in an Iranian missile attack.</p><p>At least three explosions were heard Saturday evening near the Intelligence Ministry building in northern Tehran, witnesses said, adding that air defense systems had begun operating there. Israel’s military said it had begun new strikes against missile launchers and aerial defense systems in central Iran.</p><p>In southern Iran, at least 115 people were reported killed when a girls’ school was struck, and dozens more were wounded, the local governor told Iranian state TV. U.S. Central Command spokesperson Capt. Tim Hawkins said he was “aware of reports” that a girls’ school was struck and that officials were looking into them.</p><p>Iran’s state news agency IRNA said at least 15 people were killed in the southwest, quoting the governor of the Lamerd region, Ali Alizadeh, as saying a sports hall, two residential areas and a hall near a school were hit.</p><p>Flights across the Middle East were , and air defense fire thudded over Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ commercial capital. Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the UAE capital killed one person, state media said. </p><h2>Attack was coordinated between Israel and US</h2><p>Israel said the operation had been planned for months with the United States. Air Force pilots struck “hundreds of targets across Iran,” Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a statement.</p><p>Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.</p><p>Trump acknowledged Saturday that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.” He said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran. He called on the paramilitary  to lay down arms, saying members would be given immunity or face “certain death” if they did not.</p><p>Iran had said it hoped to avert a war, but it maintained its right to enrich uranium. </p><p>Trump had threatened military action but held off following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances that evolved into a nationwide push against the ruling clerics.</p><p>The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed  in the crackdown and is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed.</p><h2>Effects could extend to markets and other countries </h2><p>The strikes could rattle global markets, particularly if Iran makes the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. A third of worldwide  transported by sea passed through the strait in 2025.</p><p>Saudi Arabia said Iran targeted its capital and eastern region in an attack that was repelled. Bahrain said a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom, and three buildings were damaged in the capital, Manama, and Muharraq city by drone strikes and debris from an intercepted missile.</p><p>Kuwait’s civil aviation authority said a drone targeted the main international airport, injuring several employees. Kuwait’s state-run news agency said three troops were injured by shrapnel from strikes that hit Ali Al-Salem air base. Explosions could also be heard in Qatar. Jordan said it “dealt with” 49 drones and ballistic missiles.</p><p>Lidman reported from in Tel Aviv. Boak reported from West Palm Beach, Florida. Tucker reported from Washington.

If convicted he faces a prison term of at least six months and up to €50,000 (£44,000) in fines. A court hearing has been scheduled for December.</p><p>On Friday, Varoufakis described the indictment as indicative of the far-right turn in politics across the west.</p><p>“My ridiculous prosecution must be seen within the wider, west-wide surge of an insidious new form of fascism,” he wrote on X, highlighting what he claimed was the appointment of “neo-fascists” to top posts in the centre-right Greek government.</p><p>“In this context, I am honoured by their determination to persecute me – as it grants me the privilege of calling upon people of good conscience, from around the world, to stand together, to oppose them.”</p><p>He accused Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis of “cutting a deal” with the far right to ensure that, unlike elsewhere in Europe, extremists did not form their own party. In prominent ministerial positions, he said, they were then able to “use their authority to appeal to their electoral base by ensuring … that people like myself are harassed and dragged through the courts”.</p><p>Varoufakis, an economics professor widely seen on the European left as Greece’s most vociferous public intellectual, spoke candidly about his own brush with drugs on the podcast in January. Although his small leftwing party, MeRA25, narrowly failed to cross the threshold into parliament in elections in June 2023, he holds particular appeal among young voters disillusioned with mainstream politics.</p><p>Asked if he had ever used drugs, he recalled an incident in Sydney in 1989 when, after a Mardi Gras parade, he had taken ecstasy during a Kylie Minogue concert. “I’m not like Bill Clinton who ‘did not inhale’. I inhaled,” he said. “I took ecstasy once. It was an amazing experience until a few days later when I had an incredible migraine … I remember dancing 15 to 16 hours, as if nothing had happened, but then I suffered for a week and never took it again.”</p><p>He went on to admit that he was still partial to “grass, but I can’t find it, and no one will give it to me”.</p><p>Critics, including TV show hosts, lashed out at the politician, accusing him of abusing his status as a role model. However, he is not the first public figure in Greece to have spoken out about recreational drug use.</p><p>The former mayor of Athens, Kostas Bakoyannis, who is Mitsotakis’s nephew, confessed in a TV interview in 2017 to smoking hashish, adding, with a laugh, that he had felt the urge to do it at family gatherings. Artists and scientists have also spoken publicly about drug use. None, however, have been prosecuted as a result.</p><p>As the row has deepened, so has support for Varoufakis.</p><p>Charalampos Poulopoulos, widely considered Greece’s pre-eminent drug abuse expert, told the Guardian the remarks were not only an expression of opinion and, as such, “a constitutionally guaranteed right”, but fell far short of promoting illegal substances and inciting others to take them.</p><p>“Several times in the past, public figures have talked about their experience with substance use in their youth without it being considered a criminal offence,” said Poulopoulos, now professor of social work in addictions at the University of West Attica. “His comments are clearly being exploited today to cultivate political fear on the basis of a fabricated risk around the spread of drugs. If convicted, he’ll become a hero. This very surprising prosecution neither serves the common good, nor public interest.”</p><p>Until laws were amended more than a decade ago, Greece had some of the toughest anti-drug legislation in Europe. In a society both socially conservative and often late to trends, heavy drug use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/greek-addicts-sisha-drug-crisis\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">arrived</a> with the debt-stricken country’s economic crisis in 2010 when unemployment and poverty began to soar.</p><p>Varoufakis took over as finance minister in 2015 as Greece’s struggle to keep bankruptcy at bay intensified shortly after a radical leftwing government assumed power.</p><p>In a statement MeRA25 vowed to tackle the issue of addiction with “a modern scientific approach and not with gendarmerie-style attitudes from the 1950s”.</p><p>Varoufakis has, meanwhile, pledged to continue speaking the language of truth in a society he claims is awash with “hypocrisy and cocaine”.</p>","contentLength":4728,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rhhpw2/yanis_varoufakis_calls_prosecution_after/"},{"title":"Iron

Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group called on Saturday for the Middle East to stand against Israel and the US after they launched a joint military offensive against Iran, after long weeks of escalating regional tensions and burgeoning threats of conflict.</p><p>Hezbollah condemned the “American-Israeli hostilities against the Islamic Republic,” but stopped short of pledging to retaliate against Israel, amid fears that it could become involved in the conflict.</p><p>The Lebanese terrorist organization also did not intervene in the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last June, which the US briefly joined.</p><p>“We call on countries and people of the region to stand strong in the face of these hostile designs,” Hezbollah said in a statement, warning that “its dire consequences will affect everyone without exception if left unchecked.”</p><p>“We’re certain that the American-Israeli enemy will be dealt a major blow, and reap nothing but failure from its criminal, tyrannical aggression,” Hezbollah added.</p><p>Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem was scheduled to make a televised speech later Saturday, but it was subsequently postponed.</p><p>The statement came after a Hezbollah official had told AFP this week that it would not intervene militarily in the event of “limited” US strikes, but would consider any attack against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a “red line.” Khamenei was among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the initial strikes.</p><p>Before the operation against Iran began, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets — including tunnel shafts and rocket launching sites — across southern Lebanon on Saturday morning.</p><p>According to the Israel Defense Forces, Hezbollah was recently working to restore its military capabilities at the targeted sites in order to advance attacks on Israel.</p><p>“This activity constitutes a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and a threat to the State of Israel,” the IDF said.</p><p>Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that the Israeli strikes targeted mountainous areas in the south where Hezbollah has a strong presence.</p><p>Earlier Saturday, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam earlier in the day saying that Lebanon refused to be dragged into war.</p><p>“I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity,” Salam said on X.</p><p>“In light of the serious developments unfolding in the region, I once again call on all Lebanese to act with wisdom and patriotism, placing Lebanon and the Lebanese people’s interests above any other consideration,” he added.</p><p>Salam later said his government was making diplomatic contacts to avoid any “repercussions” of the conflict.</p><p>At the same time, US Ambassador to Lebanon Michel Issa told Lebanese President Joseph Aoun that Israel will not escalate against Lebanon if it refrains from hostile actions.</p><p>Aoun stressed that “sparing Lebanon the disasters and horrors of external conflicts, and preserving its sovereignty, security and stability, are an absolute priority.”</p><p>Many airlines, meanwhile, announced the cancellation of their flights to airports in the Middle East, including Beirut.</p><p>Salam, however, said Beirut’s “airport remains open” and that “the national carrier’s flights are continuing.”</p><p>In a post on X, United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert urged “all parties in Lebanon” to “prioritize, in words and actions, the need to shield the country and its people from unfolding regional developments.”</p>","contentLength":3570,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rhedzn/hezbollah_condemns_strikes_on_iran_but_stops/"},{"title":"LIVE:

This will be probably your only chance for generations.” The military campaign could be a defining moment for Trump, risking a drawn-out regional war that leads to a surge in energy prices and American casualties ahead of mid-term elections this year.

According to ECFR’s latest <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-european-archipelago-building-bridges-in-a-post-western-europe/\">public opinion poll</a>, fewer Europeans than ever consider the United States under President Donald Trump “an ally that shares our interests and values”. This shift has been <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/living-in-a-nuclear-curious-world-americas-weakening-grip-on-non-proliferation/\">building</a> since at least February 2024, shortly after Trump <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68269354\">encouraged</a> Russia to attack “delinquent” US allies on the campaign trail—an intervention that crystallised fears about Washington’s reliability and fuelled Europeans’ desire for alternative models of nuclear deterrence.</p><p>Britain and France, Europe’s two nuclear-armed NATO allies, are central in the resultant conversations. Britain’s nuclear weapons have long been committed to the defence of the alliance, whereas France’s deterrent sits outside of the NATO framework. As such, French president Emmanuel Macron’s address on nuclear deterrence, which is due to take place on March 2nd, is sure to draw particular scrutiny.</p><p>American officials insist that the Trump administration’s push for a “<a href=\"https://www.war.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/4404801/remarks-by-under-secretary-of-war-for-policy-elbridge-colby-at-the-nato-defense/\">NATO 3.0</a>” merely represents the strategic rebalancing at the heart of the new <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF\">US National Defense Strategy</a>. This means Europeans assume responsibility for conventional deterrence and defence while the US remains committed to extended nuclear deterrence for its European allies. US under secretary of defense for policy, Elbridge Colby, <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/podcasts/episode/munich-security-conference-special-with-elbridge-colby/\">argued</a> at the Munich Security Conference that America had “over-assured” its European partners in the post-cold-war decades; he suggests that some “anxiety” on their part would motivate and accelerate European efforts to rearm.</p><p>But Europeans aren’t buying it. Maybe they deduce that a US with no conventional military skin in the game would hardly risk nuclear war on behalf of its European allies, which in turn could <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jjjcameron.bsky.social/post/3meq56ies2s2d\">incentivise</a> Russia to use nuclear weapons and force a halfway-disengaged US out of Europe entirely. Or perhaps they simply mistrust a US president who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78vj5n7jg3o\">claims</a> that he must “own” allies’ territory, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/12/29/in-2025-global-trade-cracked-as-europe-hurt-by-us-tariffs-and-new-china-shock\">imposes</a> tariffs and other trade measures, and <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/article/trumps-culture-war-on-europe-is-far-from-over/\">interferes</a> in their domestic political processes to boost MAGA-aligned actors.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://datacollection.ecfr.eu/\">two surveys</a> conducted by ECFR in May and November 2025, respondents across Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland now tend to support rather than oppose the idea of developing an alternative European nuclear deterrent that does not rely on the US. Only Hungarians and Italians, who (alongside Bulgarians) have by far the most positive view of Russia among all European societies polled by ECFR, consistently tend to reject such considerations.</p><p>These numbers should at least give European leaders—who have been <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/macron-open-to-deploying-french-nuclear-weapons-in-europe/a-72534138\">consulting</a> behind closed doors and are gradually making more public pronouncements—the confidence that they have electorate backing on the nuclear issue. But governments will approach these conversations from different perspectives.</p><p>For example, Germany and Italy have long been <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2025/12/investment-in-nuclear-sharing-continues-despite-european-doubts-about-us-extended-deterrence/\">host countries</a> for forward-deployed US nuclear weapons and providers of nuclear-capable fighter aircraft, with more experience of direct participation in US extended nuclear deterrence than other Europeans. As such, these countries might bring greater bureaucratic and habitual attachment to the US-centred system than other countries.</p><h2>Nuclear postures of Britain and France</h2><p>According to NATO, French and British nuclear forces already “<a href=\"https://www.nato.int/content/dam/nato/webready/documents/publications-and-reports/strategic-concepts/2022/290622-strategic-concept.pdf\">contribute</a> significantly to the overall security of the Alliance”. This is largely because London and Paris represent “separate centres of [nuclear] decision-making” that complicate potential adversaries’ risk calculations—meaning it is not just Washington’s resolve and capabilities they must consider when contemplating an attack on the alliance.</p><p>Yet there are reasons why NATO leaders frame these efforts to strengthen European deterrence as complementary to the US extended nuclear deterrent, and not in lieu of it. For one, neither France nor Britain have had the ambition to extend nuclear deterrence like the US. Their arsenals evolved in the shadow of America’s expansive cold-war nuclear posture, which consisted of tens of thousands of strategic nuclear warheads and several thousand tactical nuclear weapons forward-deployed on allied territory in Europe and Asia.</p><p>Historically, US extended nuclear deterrence intended to reassure allies that they remain secure without acquiring nuclear weapons of their own. The tactical (and non-strategic) weapons that underpinned extended deterrence also offered flexible employment options across the spectrum of conflict. France and Britain, in turn, have <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2024.2403218\">relied</a> on minimum credible deterrence postures to deter threats to their vital national interests (though these have European dimensions, as the UK-France “Northwood Declaration” of July 2025 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/northwood-declaration-10-july-2025-uk-france-joint-nuclear-statement\">stipulated</a>).</p><figure><blockquote><p>America’s eroding credibility means that it remains necessary for France and Britain to retain their nuclear forces, especially when considering future NATO security. However, to become instruments of non-proliferation or escalation management, they require development</p></blockquote></figure><p>Now America’s eroding credibility means that it remains necessary for France and Britain to retain their nuclear forces, especially when considering future NATO security. However, to become instruments of non-proliferation or escalation management, they require development. To borrow from the latest <a href=\"https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/a/am/americas-strategic-posture/strategic-posture-commission-report.ashx\">US Strategic Posture Commission</a>, French and British nuclear forces—as the core of a future European strategic deterrent—likely need to grow in size and change composition (or both) to account for structural changes in US defence strategy and Trump-specific hits to US credibility. But they would not have to replicate the US posture to achieve this.</p><p>Moreover, France, Britain and their European partners would also have to agree on joint rhetoric and actions to signal resolve and capability in European deterrence. This is not only to assure each other, but also to deter potential adversaries.</p><h2>Securing support for wider deterrence</h2><p>French survey respondents support an expansion of their country’s nuclear arsenal. However, their British counterparts are more sceptical, opposing additional weapons for the UK nuclear deterrent by slight margins.</p><p>In the language of ECFR’s Celia Belin and Pawel Zerka, who have applied an <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-european-archipelago-building-bridges-in-a-post-western-europe/\">archipelago</a> framework for coalition-building in a post-Western Europe, “bayonet coalitions” of centrist and right-wing voters in France and Britain are most likely to support adaptations to their countries’ nuclear forces—but presumably to advance national(ist) interests first.</p><p>National Rally (RN) party leader, Marine Le Pen, supports the French nuclear deterrent in principle as a source of sovereignty, but has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/france-far-right-jordan-bardella-nuclear-deterrent-nato-us-donald-trump/\">stated</a> that it “must not be shared”. Her party’s likely candidate for the French presidential elections in 2027, Jordan Bardella, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU8F5QfqWyU\">concurs</a>. He says it would be “national treason” for France to “share the button” as part of a Europeanisation of the French deterrent.</p><p>In Britain, leaders of the right-wing populist party Reform UK are less explicit on nuclear issues. This is possibly because the British submarine-launched nuclear capability is closely tied to the US nuclear enterprise and integrated with the NATO framework, and thus less salient as a symbol of national sovereignty than France’s force de dissuasion. Still, like the French nationalists’ position, Nigel Farage’s ambivalence on Russia and rejection of EU-European defence initiatives put an upper bound on centrist leaders’ ambitions for their cooperation with other Europeans on nuclear deterrence.</p><p>In all their conversations about evolving European nuclear deterrence, leaders should not forget that loose talk in Europe could loosen restraints on nuclear proliferation in other parts of the world. After all, Europeans should have an interest in reinforcing both deterrence toward Russia and the global non-proliferation regime.</p>","contentLength":7955,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rh2eix/suspicious_minds_why_europeans_are_considering/"},{"title":"US, Israel Launch 'Operation Epic Fury' in Iran","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN9OqM-wBic","date":1772284269,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":154955,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The US and Israel began striking targets across Iran, with President Donald Trump urging Iranians to overthrow the government.

The articles, produced in collaboration with the investigative collective WAV, detailed <a href=\"https://www.republik.ch/2026/02/18/how-tenaciously-palantir-courted-switzerland?utm_campaign=cm&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=palantir-en\">a years-long, multi-ministry charm offensive by Palantir</a> to sell its software to Swiss federal authorities. The campaign was, by all accounts, a comprehensive failure. Swiss agencies rejected Palantir at least nine times, with concerns ranging from data sovereignty to reputational risk to the simple fact that nobody needed the product.</p><p>The reporting was based on documents obtained through 59 freedom of information requests filed with Swiss federal agencies. The key finding was an internal Swiss Armed Forces report that concluded Palantir’s software posed unacceptable risks because sensitive military data could potentially be accessed by U.S. government intelligence agencies. As the Republik article details:</p><blockquote><p><em>The authors of the report state that using Palantir’s software would increase dependence on a U.S. provider. It also poses the risk of losing data sovereignty and thereby national sovereignty.</em></p><p><em>Above all, however, the army’s staff experts say it remains unclear who has access to data shared with Palantir. The following sentence from the Swiss Army report is particularly relevant: “Palantir is a U.S.-based company, which means there is a possibility that sensitive data could be accessed by the US government and intelligence services.”</em></p></blockquote><p>As if it’s any sort of surprise that European governments are wary of betting on US tech companies with close ties to the US government. It’s not like reports of US spies <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2014/05/19/cisco-goes-straight-to-president-to-complain-about-nsa-intercepting-its-hardware/\">co-opting US tech companies</a> for surveillance efforts haven’t been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2013/09/03/att-has-employees-embedded-govt-providing-near-realtime-searches-nearly-every-phone-call/\">front page news</a> over the past twenty years. And now,  administration—with its willingness to antagonize everyone in Europe, and its close ties to Palantir and Thiel? It’s no freaking wonder that the Swiss government was like “yo, maybe pass.”</p><p>So how does a sophisticated data intelligence company respond to well-sourced investigative journalism based on official government documents?</p><p>By suing the journalists, of course.</p><p>But here’s the thing that makes this even more absurd: Palantir isn’t even claiming the articles are false. The company isn’t suing for defamation. It isn’t seeking damages. Instead, it’s invoking a Swiss “right of reply” statute, alleging that Republik didn’t give the company a sufficient opportunity to respond. Palantir wants the court to force the magazine to publish lengthy counter-statements to each article.</p><blockquote><p><em>Palantir’s lawsuit, filed in January, is not seeking damages or making libel claims against Republik, but instead alleges that the company was not given sufficient right to reply under Swiss media law. The company objects to Republik’s presentation of the public documents and believes its right to reply has been wrongfully denied.</em></p><p><em>Republik’s managing director Katharina Hemmer said Palantir had wanted the magazine to publish a very lengthy counterstatement to each article. Republik believed the proposed statements did not fairly address or rebut the reporting, she said, adding that the magazine stands by its reporting.</em></p></blockquote><p>To which I say: good. Because Palantir’s demand here is absurd. Oh boo-fucking-hoo, the big defense contractor didn’t like the coverage? Pull on your big boy pants and get over it. Switzerland’s right of reply law exists so people can correct factual errors, not so corporations can force publications to run PR copy because they didn’t like the tone of accurate, document-based reporting.</p><p>And it’s worth noting: Palantir has already used other avenues to respond. The company published <a href=\"https://blog.palantir.com/korrektur-wie-das-online-magazin-die-republik-einen-regierungsbericht-zu-palantir-verdrehte-9a1b399ae255\">a blog post</a> complaining that the Republik article “paints a false and misleading picture” and “hinders important discussions about the modernization of European software.” They’ve got the platform. If Palantir wants to push back on the story, they have many methods of doing so. Hell, they can do so on X any time they want—on what Musk and company like to call the global town square for free speech.</p><p>But that’s apparently not enough. Instead, a multibillion-dollar American defense and intelligence contractor is hauling a small independent Swiss magazine into court, not because anything the magazine published was wrong, but because Palantir wants to  the publication to run its talking points under legal compulsion.</p><p>Compelled speech isn’t free speech, guys. And this is nothing more than a blatant intimidation campaign to frighten away reporters from reporting the truth about Palantir.</p><p>The European Federation of Journalists has <a href=\"https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2026/02/17/switzerland-us-analytics-firm-takes-republik-magazine-to-court/\">called this exactly what it is</a>: a SLAPP suit—a strategic lawsuit against public participation, designed to use the weight and cost of litigation to intimidate and punish journalists for doing their jobs.</p><blockquote><p><em>“The investigation conducted by WAV and Republik into Palantir is largely based on official documents that journalists were able to access thanks to Swiss freedom of information law,” notes EFJ President Maja Sever. “The legal action brought by this powerful multinational firm against a small Swiss media start-up is, in our view, an attempt at intimidation aimed at discouraging any critical analysis of Palantir’s activities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And in case you didn’t catch the irony: the Swiss military rejected Palantir in part because of fears about a heavy-handed American entity with uncomfortably close ties to U.S. intelligence. Palantir’s response to the reporting of that rejection? Behave like a heavy-handed American entity trying to bully a small foreign publication into submission. If anyone at Palantir had run this decision through their own pattern-recognition software, you’d hope a few red flags would have popped up.</p><p>Meanwhile, the lawsuit has done exactly what anyone with a passing familiarity with the Streisand Effect could have predicted. The original Republik articles were about the Swiss government politely but firmly declining Palantir’s advances—an embarrassing but relatively contained story.</p><p>Now, thanks to the lawsuit, the story has gone international. The Financial Times is covering it. The European Federation of Journalists is covering it. A UK member of parliament has already cited the Republik investigation during a debate on British defense contracts with Palantir, using the story to suggest that the British government “pivot away” from Palantir.</p><p>It paints a picture of a company that spent seven years working every angle to get Swiss federal agencies to buy its products—approaching the Federal Chancellery during COVID, pitching the Federal Office of Public Health on contact tracing, presenting anti-money laundering software to financial regulators, making repeated runs at the military—and getting turned away at every door. Sometimes embarrassingly, such as the Federal Statistical Office director apparently just ignoring Palantir’s outreach entirely.</p><p>For a company that brags about its ability to “optimize the kill chain” and whose CEO once told investors that “Palantir is here to disrupt… and, when it’s necessary, to scare our enemies and occasionally kill them,” getting politely rejected by the Swiss statistical office has to sting a little.</p><p>But suing the journalists who reported on it? When the entire basis of your lawsuit is “we want you to publish our talking points” rather than “anything you published was wrong,” it makes pretty clear you don’t actually have a substantive response to the reporting.

Thus, according to the first estimate, the economy grew by 3.2 percent in the entire last year.\n</p><p><strong>Strong growth in consumption and investment\n</strong></p><p>According to the CBS, household consumption, the largest component of GDP, grew by 2.6 percent annually in the last quarter of last year, faster than in the previous quarter, when growth was 1.9 percent. Gross fixed capital formation, on the other hand, grew by 6.9 percent, slower than in the previous quarter's 7.5 percent. Government consumption grew by 4.7 percent, after growing by 3.8 percent in the previous quarter.\n</p><p>Exports of goods and services, on the other hand, grew by 1.5 percent annually, after a 1.1 percent decline in the previous quarter. Exports of goods grew by 2.4 percent, and services by 1.6 percent. Imports of goods and services, on the other hand, increased by 0.3 percent, significantly less than in the previous quarter's 2.4 percent. Imports of goods fell by 0.4 percent, while imports of services increased by 3.1 percent.\n</p><p><strong>Growth still faster than the EU average\n</strong></p><p>According to seasonally adjusted data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, the economy grew by 3.3 percent annually in the last quarter of last year, and by 1.4 percent quarterly. Thus, the growth of the domestic economy on an annual basis remains significantly faster than the average in the European Union (EU).\n</p><p>Eurostat recently announced that in the past quarter, the EU economy, according to seasonally adjusted data, grew by 0.3 percent compared to the previous quarter, and by 1.4 percent annually. The Eurozone economy, on the other hand, grew by 0.3 percent quarterly and 1.3 percent annually in that quarter.\n</p><p><strong>Plenković: Economy in full swing, stable growth in 2026 as well</strong></p><p>Prime Minister  commented on X on Friday on the year-on-year GDP growth of 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, stating that the economy is in full swing and that stable growth can be expected in 2026 as well.\n</p><p>“In the fourth quarter of 2025, real GDP growth was 3.6 percent compared to the same period in 2024. GDP growth in the whole of 2025 is 3.2 percent, which is in line with the government's projections,” Plenković wrote.\n</p><p>He also pointed out that Croatia is one of only four countries that has recorded a continuous GDP growth trend since the beginning of 2021, and for 20 consecutive quarters. According to him, this confirms the fact that the economy is still in full swing and, as he wrote, \"we can expect stable growth in 2026.\"\n</p><p>“This growth is the result of increased investments (especially through the absorption of funds from the National Investment Fund and EU funds), as well as household consumption and exports. Compared to other EU member states, the Croatian economy in the 4th quarter of 2025 was among the four fastest growing (after Ireland, Malta and Cyprus), growing faster than at the level of the entire European Union (1.5 percent) and the Eurozone (1.3 percent). We continue to approach the average development of the EU,” said Plenković in a post on X.\n</p><p><strong>Bule: Unusually long upward phase\n</strong></p><p>State Secretary at the Ministry of Finance  said that data on GDP growth in the fourth quarter, at 3.6 percent on an annual basis, confirm the continued strong growth of the Croatian economy, which is many times stronger than the average of the euro area and the European Union.\n</p><p>He pointed out that the economy has been growing for 20 consecutive quarters, or five years, and that it accelerated further at the end of the year, which shows its strength and momentum. Based on this, as well as high-frequency indicators, he expects continued growth in 2026 and further convergence towards the EU average.\n</p><p>Investments contributed the most to growth, which increased by almost seven percent and accounted for half of the total year-on-year GDP growth. Despite the unfavorable international environment and weak growth in major foreign trade partners such as Germany, Italy and Austria, net foreign demand also made a positive contribution, which, according to Bule, demonstrates the resilience and competitiveness of the Croatian export sector.\n</p><p>He added that the manufacturing industry and the ICT sector also contributed positively, and Croatia, with the exception of the pandemic contraction, has been growing for ten years while reducing macroeconomic imbalances, maintaining fiscal discipline and social cohesion.\n</p><p><strong>Šaravanja: The post-pandemic take-off phase is over\n</strong></p><p>The chief economist of the Croatian Chamber of Economy, , pointed out that the domestic economy continued to grow last year, but with signs of slowing down, and warned of growing imbalances in public finances and the balance of payments.\n</p><p>“Although GDP growth was solid, especially in the context of growth dynamics in the EU, it was the lowest in the post-pandemic period. The pressure on the budget, primarily due to the extreme growth of wages in the public sector during 2024, which spilled over into 2025 as a permanent cost, as well as the growth of social benefits, led to an increase in the budget deficit, which in 2025 approached the three percent of GDP mark,” Šaravanja pointed out.\n</p><p>He added that at the same time, high prices for services in tourism and trade can clearly no longer compensate for the stagnation in the number of tourist overnight stays, so there is no real growth in foreign exchange income from tourism, which is a key counterweight to the deficit in the trade of goods, which deepens the imbalance in the current account of the balance of payments.\n</p><p>“As in the previous year, GDP growth was based on resilient personal consumption (+2.5 percent), the growth of which was maintained by increases in employment, wages and credit indebtedness, and on investments (+6.1 percent), financed mostly from EU funds, especially through the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism. However, the same items that generate current growth are also creating imbalances, because economic growth is not keeping up with the growth in productivity and competitiveness,” Šaravanja noted in his commentary.\n</p><p>“Although industry made a positive contribution to GDP growth for the first time in two years (growth of 2.9 percent), the slowdown in growth in other sectors, especially construction (from 15.1 to 7.3 percent) and tourism and trade (from 5.9 to 2.7 percent), was more pronounced and slowed down overall GDP growth,” he stated.\n</p><p>“Namely, the construction boom was exhausted after much of the reconstruction after the earthquake was completed. Real trade growth slowed due to persistently high inflation, which reduced consumer optimism, as well as slower growth in disposable income. At the same time, due to the increase in the prices of services in tourism and trade and the stagnation of the number of tourist overnight stays, the value of foreign exchange income from tourism, which is a key counterweight to the trade deficit, is falling in real terms,” he noted.\n</p>","contentLength":7309,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rgvpht/croatian_gdp_accelerates_to_36_percent/"},{"title":"/r/WorldNews Discussion Thread: Explosions heard in Tehran as Israel's defense minister confirms Israel has attacked Iran (Thread #1)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rgvngq/rworldnews_discussion_thread_explosions_heard_in/","date":1772261320,"author":"/u/progress18","guid":155054,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Israeli Defense minister: We have launched preemptive strike against Iran","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/pmx16zge8","date":1772259673,"author":"/u/Intelligent-Juice895","guid":154882,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rgv6a2/israeli_defense_minister_we_have_launched/"},{"title":"Critical Minerals: Africa's Strategic Moment | Bloomberg Next Africa","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KR1BuyUSR8","date":1772258401,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":154887,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In this episode of Next Africa, we examine the intensifying global race for critical minerals and how the continent can turn surging demand into lasting economic gains.

Both sides have reported heavy losses.</p><p>Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared an “all-out confrontation” with the Taliban government, posting on X: “Now it is open war between us and you.”</p><p>Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban’s leaders were ready to negotiate with Pakistan in order to bring an end to the violence.</p><p>“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to resolve issues through dialogue, and now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue,” said Mujahid.</p><p>The latest violence erupted after <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/27/pakistan-bombs-kabul-why-are-afghanistan-and-pakistan-fighting\">Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory last weekend</a> triggered Afghan retaliatory attacks along the border on Thursday, escalating long‑simmering tensions over Pakistan’s claim that Afghanistan shelters Pakistan Taliban fighters.

The proposal was <a href=\"https://howtheyvote.eu/votes/182767\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">backed by a majority</a> of MEPs in December.</p><p>The commission said countries would be able to draw on already allocated funds for social services to support travel and access to abortion care. “This is groundbreaking,” said Hadja Lahbib, the EU’s commissioner for equality. “This decision will change lives.”</p><p>The aim was to reduce the 500,000 unsafe abortions that took place in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Europe</a> every year, she said. “This is half a million women at risk, half a million women traumatised, half a million women who may carry lifelong consequences, and this is half a million too many,” added Lahbib.</p><p>“We live, of course, unfortunately, in a time when women’s bodies have become political battlefields, when rights are being rolled back around the world. But Europe is standing firm.”</p><p>The EU has seen a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/vicious-cycle-far-right-parties-across-europe-are-inspiring-imitators\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">surge in support</a> for far-right parties, many of which oppose abortion. Olivier Bault of Ordo Iuris, a Polish anti-abortion group that championed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/06/poland-women-donald-tusk-abortion-promises\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">a near-blanket ban</a> in 2020, told Reuters the EU announcement impinged on countries’ rights to set their own health policies.</p><p>“Using the European social fund, arguing that it can be used for healthcare purposes, means making a joke of Europeans’ national laws,” he said.</p><p>But Nika Kovač, the coordinator of the My Voice, My Choice campaign, said: “For the first time, the commission confirms unequivocally that EU funds can be used to guarantee access to safe abortion care ー particularly for women in vulnerable situations, regardless of where they come from in Europe.</p><p>“Today is a victory for women in Europe. This is not symbolic. It is a political commitment to women’s rights.”</p><p>While campaigners were disappointed that the commission had stopped short of allocating new financial resources, they embraced what they saw as a new path toward guaranteeing women’s rights. “Member states must now use the pathway that was created,” said Kovač.</p><p>Campaigners said their work was far from done, noting that they would continue to push the commission to provide additional, dedicated funding for abortions. They also called on the commission to be swift in providing clear instructions to member states on how they could access the funds and in creating a means for women to access the scheme across the bloc.</p><p>Manon Aubry, a leftwing French MEP, said: “We’re going to fight until not a single woman is dying in Europe because she cannot access abortion.”</p>","contentLength":3077,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rgcbc0/eu_opens_up_funding_to_guarantee_abortion_rights/"},{"title":"What It Actually Takes to Run a Broadway Show Every Night | WSJ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPQO353bUaQ","date":1772211642,"author":"The Wall Street Journal","guid":154622,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Broadway has long been a place where audiences come to put their fears aside and sit together to be entertained, even in times of war, recession and uncertainty.

But Trump’s recent remarks placed greater emphasis on Tehran’s missile capabilities, warning they could eventually threaten the US homeland as well as American bases overseas.</p><p>“They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America,\" said Trump during his State of Union address this week.</p><p>Shayan Samii, a former US government appointee, said the messaging appeared designed to build a political and public framework for possible escalation.</p><p>“President Trump tried to create basically a framework for what a military intervention would be and why there is a need for a military intervention,” Samii told <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noindex nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkQfDzXe2KE&amp;list=PLrqEUp1jEA7Wh9Wgwh15AjwEETFIN7T4G\"></a></p><p>He added that referencing the reported killing of tens of thousands of protesters carried particular significance.</p><p>“When he validates the number 32,000, that basically is telling the world that a massacre has occurred and we need to have a collective response for it,” Sami said.</p><p>The framing, he argued, was aimed not only at Trump’s political base but also at building broader bipartisan support in Washington.</p><p>Despite increasingly forceful rhetoric from Washington, analysts said Tehran appears to be continuing escalation while dismissing the significance of US warnings.</p><p>Middle East historian and political analyst Shahram Kholdi said Islamic Republic leaders are behaving as though the shift in tone does not signal imminent action.</p><p>“They are reacting as if they have not heard anything that President Trump has said,” Kholdi said.</p><p>He described Iran’s posture as a pattern of “passive-aggressive… escalatory behavior,” arguing that the regime is rebuilding military capabilities damaged in earlier confrontations during the 12-day war in June.</p><p>“They are rebuilding everything… the ballistic missile program, air defense systems,” he said, adding that Tehran appears to view Washington as “all rhetoric and no action.”</p><p><strong>Diplomacy meets deterrence</strong></p><p>The day after the latest round of talks concluded Thursday, Trump signaled growing frustration with negotiations.</p><p>“I’m not happy with the fact that they’re not willing to give us what we have to have… We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters Friday. “No, I’m not happy with the way they’re going.”</p><p>The remarks come amid a substantial US military deployment already positioned in and around the Middle East, including carrier strike groups, advanced fighter aircraft and additional naval assets — a buildup analysts say increases pressure while diplomacy continues.</p><p>Sayeh argued that extended negotiations may serve a strategic purpose by demonstrating that diplomatic avenues have been exhausted.</p><p>“As the talks drag out… it signals to the world that the West has exhausted all diplomatic options,” he said.</p><p>The combination of military buildup, shifting rhetoric and bipartisan concern marks a notable turning point in how Iran is being discussed in Washington.</p><p>Historian and political analyst Shahram Kholdi described the US military buildup as “a world war scale force,” comparing it to the kind of power Washington brought to bear during World War II’s Operation Torch.</p><p>As negotiations continue alongside escalating military signaling, the central question remains unresolved: whether the current posture is intended to force concessions from Tehran or to prepare the ground for a more decisive action.</p>","contentLength":4476,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rgak9z/china_urges_citizens_in_iran_to_evacuate/"},{"title":"Kabul residents recount Pakistani airstrikes","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RGqtg2C8Kio","date":1772207887,"author":"Reuters","guid":154578,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Survivors of a Pakistani airstrike recounted their experiences following an overnight attack on major cities in Afghanistan.
