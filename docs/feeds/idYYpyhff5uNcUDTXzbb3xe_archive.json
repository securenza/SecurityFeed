She and some colleagues are taking legal action to fight for the existence of VOA and its sister organizations. In an extensive interview with DW's Ines Pohl, she explains how the Trump administration's actions have resulted in the silencing of the Voice of America (VOA), impacting its role as a crucial source of information for a global audience. Widakuswara and her colleagues are taking legal action to challenge the administration's efforts to undermine VOA, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights and constitutes executive overreach.\n\nShe says that the absence of VOA leaves a significant gap in international broadcasting, which is being exploited by adversaries like Russia and extremist organizations, potentially spreading misinformation.\n\nIn her opinion the current situation poses a broader threat to journalism in the U.S., with increased restrictions affecting not only VOA but also other media outlets, contributing to a climate of fear among journalists. The discussion highlights the plight of vulnerable journalists, particularly those on J-1 visas, who face dangerous consequences if forced to return to their home countries due to job losses at VOA.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#voa #voiceofamerica #journalism</article>","contentLength":1850,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/8Y5Fphrks9Y?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Where do disused wind turbines end up? | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FKg2rkEtQ8","date":1742846403,"author":"DW News","guid":13399,"unread":true,"content":"<article>For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#windturbines #recycle #landfills</article>","contentLength":452,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2FKg2rkEtQ8?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Protests in Ankara over jailing of Istanbul mayor","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RCFTj3ZdQs","date":1742846322,"author":"Reuters","guid":13393,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Protesters rally in Ankara over the detention of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, which has triggered the biggest street protests in Turkey in more than a decade.\n\n#Istanbul #Turkey #EkremImamoglu #Imamoglu #TayyipErdogan #Erdogan #Protests #Rally #Reuters #News #Live\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/</article>","contentLength":384,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/7RCFTj3ZdQs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"'Liberation Day' Is Coming April 2, Trump Says","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImP4l5gwJUk","date":1742846149,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":13396,"unread":true,"content":"<article>President Donald Trump outlines his plan for tariffs that are going to come into effect on April 2.

On Facebook, she had interacted with Katrin Ivanova and Biser Dzhambazov.</p><p>We then found she was an airline worker.</p><p>According to her Linkedin profile, she has held positions in ticket sales for travel companies. Bulgarian company filings say she is the sole owner of International Aviation Consult.</p><p>Screen captures of travel data found on a hard drive belonging to cell leader Roussev were from airline industry software known as \"Amadeus\".</p><p>On her LinkedIn profile, we found Ms Gencheva noted her proficiency with the software.</p><p>After the BBC's research identified Ms Gencheva, a source confirmed to the BBC that she is known to the Bulgarian security services as being connected to the spy network. She is not charged with any offence.</p><p>We contacted Ms Gencheva on a Bulgarian phone number she uses for real estate work. She hung up when informed the call was from BBC News and was being recorded, not even waiting for an explanation of what we were calling about.</p><p>In response to a letter setting out the evidence relating to her, she said she did \"not wish to comment on the case\" and did not consent for her name to be used. Writing in Bulgarian, she claimed not to speak English well. However, her public LinkedIn profile lists her English ability as \"full professional proficiency\" and says she has studied in English to degree level.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Ms Doncheva helped spy on the investigative journalist Christo Grozev in Vienna, occupying a flat opposite where he lived and operating a camera that took images of his home.</p><p>She was paid to conduct an anti-Ukraine propaganda campaign, which included putting stickers on locations including Vienna's Soviet war memorial and was intended to make supporters of Ukraine appear like neo-Nazis.</p><p>The BBC identified Ms Doncheva through her social media profiles after the Old Bailey trial heard about a \"Tsveti\" who had worked with the cell. Sources in Austria then confirmed her identity.</p><p>In Vienna, she met at least three of those convicted of spying in the UK case - Vanya Gaberova, Biser Dzhambazov and Katrin Ivanova.</p><p>Senior Austrian officials, including the head of the Secret Service Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, were among those selected for surveillance by Ms Doncheva, alongside the Austrian investigative journalist Anna Thalhammer, who has written about Russian espionage.</p><p>Ms Doncheva, who is unemployed, was arrested by Austrian police in December.</p><p>Court documents first reported by the Austrian magazines Profil and Falter, and later seen by the BBC, reveal she is \"strongly suspected of having committed the crime of secret intelligence to the detriment of Austria\".</p><p>She told investigators she conducted surveillance after being asked by long-time friend Vanya Gaberova - one of the six Bulgarians awaiting sentencing. She said Gaberova provided her with a list of names, addresses and photographs.</p><p>She initially told police she had been misled by the others, who first told her they were conducting a \"student project\" and later that they were working for Interpol. But Austrian investigators are recorded as saying it is \"incomprehensible\" that Ms Doncheva believed such \"dubious stories\".</p><p>The documents say the intelligence cell in which Ms Doncheva operated was ultimately controlled by Jan Marsalek from Moscow on behalf of the Russian intelligence services and that evidence seized by investigators shows she was contracted by Marsalek and the UK cell leader Orlin Roussev.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The documents say Marsalek directed that Anna Thalhammer be targeted. Ms Doncheva admitted to police she had photographed the journalist's then workplace and sought to watch her from a nearby restaurant.</p><p>Ms Thalhammer, now editor of Austrian news magazine Profil, told the BBC she was first told about being spied on last year by police, and she is now aware of being watched for some time.</p><p>\"She obviously sat in front of the office in a very nice fish restaurant. I really can recommend it. She complained that it's too expensive, that she needs more money. She got that money.\"</p><p>She says \"that woman\" also spied on a number of \"high-ranked people\".</p><p>Ms Thalhammer does not know where else she was followed, but that some of her sources were identified and attempts were made to break into their homes.</p><p>She says \"Vienna is the capital of spies\" but no one has been sentenced in the city for espionage and the \"law here is great for spies\".</p><p>\"I'm frustrated and I'm also honestly a little bit scared,\" she added. \"I live alone with my daughter.

We also observed her entering Ms Doncheva's registered home address less than 20 minutes after she denied being Ms Doncheva.</p><p>She has not responded to a letter offering her a chance to comment.</p><p>The two women worked alongside the six Bulgarians who were convicted of conspiring to spy for Russia.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>A cache of almost 80,000 Telegram messages between Roussev and his controller Marsalek was recovered by UK police.</p><p>The messages revealed multiple operations carried out by the cell in the years before February 2023, when their activities were disrupted by police.</p><p>The UK-based spies even targeted Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military base in Germany. Roussev and Marsalek discussed kidnapping and killing journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov.</p><p>Unlike the six spies convicted in the UK, Ms Doncheva and Ms Gencheva are not in custody and have not been convicted of any offence.</p><p>The Austrian public prosecutor's request for pre-trial detention of Ms Doncheva was rejected and she was released.</p><p>Austrian court documents state there is \"no risk\" of Ms Doncheva absconding because she is \"socially integrated\" in the country and cares for her mother, and that a risk of further crime is not particularly high given the imprisonment in the UK of others involved,</p><p>Ms Thalhammer told the BBC she \"can't understand\" why the person who spied on her was released.</p><p>\"Maybe [they] shouldn't believe everything a spy says.\" </p><p>She said the Austrian secret service thinks there are other spy cells and that their activity has continued after the arrest of the six Bulgarians in the UK.</p><p>Ms Gencheva has remained free in Bulgaria, publicly presenting herself as an experienced airline and travel industry professional.</p><p>After being contacted by the BBC, Ms Gencheva changed her profile name on Facebook and LinkedIn.

He has been considered an important partner: a fellow populist at the heart of Europe, within NATO. Orban wants to show the world he still is important to President Trump. But it appears Trump doesn't need Orban within the EU - because he’s ignoring Europe. At the first pre-peace-talks meeting in Saudi Arabia in February, the US and Russia not only excluded Ukraine, they also didn’t invite the Europeans. And if Trump really does want a friend in Europe, these days there are other candidates to choose from. Orban may have been the trailblazer for illiberalism and radical populist policies in modern-day Europe. But he’s no longer the only one. And the others are in more important EU countries: Italy, and the biggest of all: Germany.

Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn’t find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration’s contentious relationship with journalists—and Trump’s periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Two days later—Thursday—at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the “Houthi PC small group.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A message to the group, from “Michael Waltz,” read as follows: “Team – establishing a principles [] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The message continued, “Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The term  generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying—but I’ll say it anyway—that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">One minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/marco-rubio/\">Marco Antonio Rubio</a>—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/j-d-vance/\">JD Vance</a>” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/tulsi-gabbard/\">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/stephen-miller/\">Stephen Miller</a>. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That was the end of the Thursday text chain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">After receiving the Waltz text related to the “Houthi PC small group,” I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of  in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The next day, things got even stranger.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, “Michael Waltz” texted the group: “Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.” (, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) “State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled “JD Vance” responded at 8:16: “Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.” (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, “3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump’s position on virtually any issue. “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A person identified in Signal as “Joe Kent” (Trump’s nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, “There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We’ll have the exact same options in a month.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Then, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user “John Ratcliffe.” The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 8:27, a message arrived from the “Pete Hegseth” account. “VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Hegseth message goes on to state, “Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don’t get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC”—operations security. “I welcome other thoughts.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A few minutes later, the “Michael Waltz” account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. “Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president’s request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The account identified as “JD Vance” addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: “if you think we should do it let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.” (The administration has argued that America’s European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy’s protection of international shipping lanes.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At this point, the previously silent “S M” joined the conversation. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That message from “S M”—presumably President Trump’s confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller—effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from “Pete Hegseth,” who wrote at 9:46 a.m., “Agree.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">After reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled “Pete Hegseth” posted in Signal a “TEAM UPDATE.” I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command’s area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. “I will say a prayer for victory,” Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched . Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, “Michael Waltz” had provided the group an update. Again, I won’t quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an “amazing job.” A few minutes later, “John Ratcliffe” wrote, “A good start.” Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including “MAR,” who wrote, “Good Job Pete and your team!!,” and “Susie Wiles,” who texted, “Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” “Steve Witkoff” responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. “TG” responded, “Great work and effects!” The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">On Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC’s  and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration’s more hesitant approach. “These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth—what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,” he said. “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group’s creator, “Michael Waltz,” that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left—or, more to the point, who I was.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” Hughes wrote. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. “The Vice President’s first priority is always making sure that the President’s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,” he said. “Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters—not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I’ve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of “national defense” information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law’s definition of “national defense” information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF—most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home—or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped “top secret” or not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">There was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">“Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,” Baron said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist—presumably by mistake—to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group—which, at the time, included me—“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><em>Shane Harris contributed reporting. </em></p>","contentLength":21591,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jivjuv/trump_administration_accidentally_leaks_war_plans/"},{"title":"Ukraine’s most dangerous city craves relief from killer drones | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYUGvy6gkI","date":1742835199,"author":"Reuters","guid":13346,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Ukrainian city of Kherson, continually targeted by Russian drone attacks, is seeking respite.

The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.</p><p>\"If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States —that's on top of existing tariffs,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House. </p><p>Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.</p><p>\"This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,\" Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.</p><p> crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET.

India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.</p><p>Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office. The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.</p></div><div><p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/chevron-ceo-lobbies-for-more-time-to-wind-down-venezuela-operations-5afc2dee\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.</p><p>The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.</p><p>Trump invoked the 1798 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/\" target=\"_blank\">Alien Enemies Act</a> on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua.

Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis.

The Kyiv Post was unable to independently verify the video’s location or timing.</p><p>The report specifies that the Ka-52 is an attack helicopter used by Russia for reconnaissance and striking ground targets. In contrast, the Mi-8 transport helicopters are deployed to move personnel and cargo and support ground operations.</p><p>According to open sources, a Ka-52 helicopter costs approximately $16 million, and an Mi-8 around $8 million.</p><p>As reported by Kyiv Post, the Kamaz Ka-52 Alligator is widely regarded by military analysts as <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/20317\">one of the world’s top attack helicopters</a>, thanks to its counter-rotating rotors, advanced targeting systems, heavy armor, and powerful weaponry.</p><p>Designed for a two-person crew, the Ka-52 is heavily promoted for its Vikhr attack missile, which Moscow claims can destroy a tank from a distance of 10 km. This allows Ka-52 gunners to hit targets beyond the range of many battlefield point-defense systems such as MANPADS.</p><p>According to Forbes, Ka-52 helicopters were likely responsible for some of Ukraine’s equipment losses during the 2023 counteroffensive, using their long-range missiles to engage targets while hovering over the battlefield.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/31249#articles-sub-title-2\">The Mi-8 (NATO designation: Hip)</a> is a versatile twin-engine helicopter developed by the Mil Design Bureau in the early 1960s. It is one of the most widely produced helicopters in aviation history and is used extensively for both civilian and military operations.</p><p>Equipped with advanced navigation, flight instruments, and radio systems, the Mi-8 can operate in both clear and challenging weather conditions, day or night.</p><p>The helicopter comes in multiple configurations. The passenger version seats up to 18 people, while the transport variant features folding benches for up to 24 troops.</p><p>The Mi-8MT military transport modification is designed for troop deployment and evacuation, fire support, precision bombing, and cargo transport, making it a key asset for airborne operations.</p><p>As per the SSO, all helicopters were destroyed in an artillery missile strike on a concealed Russian jump pad - an improvised, camouflaged position used for rapid redeployment and surprise attacks against Ukraine’s Security and Defense Forces.</p><p>“The enemy once again believed it was safe deep in the rear. We have once again proven that nothing is beyond the reach of the SSO,” the report read.</p><p>This operation adds to a series of precision strikes carried out by Ukrainian forces in the Russian rear. On March 20, the HUR reported hitting multiple targets in Russian-occupied Crimea in recent days, including air defense systems, the tugboat Fedor Uryupin, and <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49212\">a Mi-8 helicopter.</a></p>","contentLength":3200,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jim11p/himars_strike_wipes_out_four_russian_helicopters/"},{"title":"Police Officers Use Pepper Spray on a Demonstrator Wearing Dervish Clothes | Istanbul, Turkey","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jilyxo/police_officers_use_pepper_spray_on_a/","date":1742805115,"author":"/u/arsenpontius","guid":12790,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: EU's top diplomat and Israel's foreign minister hold press conference","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jne6IsuGm0","date":1742805068,"author":"Associated Press","guid":12738,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas hold a press conference in Jerusalem.\n\n#europe #israel #live</article>","contentLength":140,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/5Jne6IsuGm0?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"US airstrikes launched against Yemen's Houthi rebels","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzoQUUWW7PY","date":1742804700,"author":"Associated Press","guid":12737,"unread":true,"content":"<article>U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country into Monday, with the group saying the one attack in the capital killed at least one person and wounded more than a dozen others.

Vi må derfor se alvoren i øjnene og erkende, at hver eneste minut gælder for, at amerikanernes drøm om at annektere vores land ikke bliver til realitet, og der har vi brug for et handlekraftigt og beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, som kan træde til på vegne af befolkningen, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede (IA).</p><h3>Hvor bliver vores allierede af?</h3><p>Múte Bourup Egede mener, at de demokratiske lande og især Grønlands allierede er alt for tøvende med at erklære og udvise deres støtte til Grønland:</p><p>- Indtil for nyligt kunne vi trygt stole på amerikanerne, som jo var vores allierede og venner, og som vi yndede at arbejde tæt sammen med. De har udvist respekt for os som et samfund, og vi har lavet gode samarbejdsrelationer, som gerne skulle holde i mange år. Men den tid er forbi, det må vi erkende, for den nye amerikanske ledelse er helt og aldeles ligeglad med, hvad vi hidtil har stået sammen om, for nu gælder det kun for dem at overtage vores land hen over hovedet på os, siger Múte Bourup Egede og fortsætter:</p><p>- Ja, de vestlige allierede stod sammen og hjalp hinanden i tykt og tyndt, men det er endevendt nu med den siddende præsident i USA. Men at vores øvrige allierede i det internationale samfund føles at gemme sig i et lille hjørne og nærmest hvisker, at de støtter os, har ingen effekt, og hvis de ikke højlydt siger fra overfor, hvordan USA behandler Grønland, vil situationen eskalere dag for dag, og den amerikanske aggression vil tiltage. Så vi har behov for, at vores øvrige allierede klart og tydeligt kommer med deres støtte og opbakning til os, påpeger Múte Bourup Egede til Sermitsiaq.</p><h3>Mike Waltz-signalet er ikke til at misforstå</h3><p>Múte Bourup Egede henviser til det forestående \"private\" besøg, hvor vicepræsidentens hustru, Usha Vance, med stor sandsynlighed vil have følgeskab af Donald Trumps sikkerhedsrådgiver Mike Waltz.</p><p>Bourup Egede mener, at det er en meget klar provokation, og at det er en farlig en af slagsen:</p><p>- Vi er nu på et niveau, hvor det på ingen måde kan karakteriseres som et harmløs besøg fra en politikerkone, der er udsigt til. For hvad skal sikkerhedsrådgiveren i Grønland? Det eneste formål er at vise magtdemonstration over for os, og signalet er ikke til at misforstå. Det er Trumps fortrolige og nærmeste rådgiver, og alene hans tilstedeværelse i Grønland vil helt sikkert få amerikanerne til at tro på Trumps mission, og presset vil tiltage efter besøget. Så kom nu med et beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, det er nu vi har brug for det, slutter formanden for Inuit Ataqatigiit, Múte Bourup Egede.</p>","contentLength":2887,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jil76k/greenlands_pm_the_international_community_needs/"},{"title":"Hundreds gather outside Tesla showroom in Boston to protest Elon Musk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCH6kjh2tlk","date":1742799624,"author":"Associated Press","guid":12719,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Protests at Tesla dealerships across the U.S. continued over the weekend drawing hundreds of demonstrators calling for billionaire Elon Musk’s ouster from the federal government.

for us, especially as we want our partner organisations to be compensated for the work they have put into the programs,\" said Julia Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Swedish government's international development agency.</p><p>In the government-to-government emails, it was made clear that other foreign governments had also given money to USAID for distribution, according to an official directly familiar with the matter who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The US State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to questions asking how many foreign governments had money for joint development programs going unspent.</p><p>Nor did it comment on any contributions from allies that were yet to be refunded in the USAID funding freeze and

water supplies.</p><p>The US failure so far to disburse or refund allies' donations is harming \"6 million of the poorest and most vulnerable farmers in the world who are dependent on the technologies for their food production and food security\", Ms Lindholm added in an email sent to the Associated Press.</p><p>She called the WE4F program \"extraordinarily impactful\", with measurable benefits for farmers and others many times greater than the program's initial targets.</p><p>Sweden's development agency said it estimated it had $US12 million total, including $US5.1 million for WE4F, sitting in USAID accounts.</p><p>The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation confirmed it had not received information about the fate of a $US1.4 million contribution it made to WE4F since the USAID dissolving began.</p><p>And the Dutch Foreign Ministry said it reached out to the US aid agency to ask how much of the $US1.6 million it had given for WE4F was yet to be disbursed by USAID and should

And so that’s what I fear — is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now,” Smith said in the telephone interview.</p><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><p>“‘I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials: ‘Let’s just put things on pause so we can get through an election. Let’s have the best person at the table make the argument for how they would deal with that,’ and I think that’s Pierre Poilievre.”</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Poilievre has been working to distance himself from the Republicans and President Trump, but an Alberta political analyst said Smith did him no favours.</p><p>“We know that Danielle Smith has the potential to be a big liability for Pierre Poilievre. That’s been the case since she became premier and perhaps even before that,” said Lori Williams, a political analyst at Mount Royal University in Calgary.</p><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><blockquote></blockquote><p>Asked about Smith’s comments on Sunday, Poilievre avoided directly responding to anything she said but pointed out that Trump recently told Fox News he thought it would be easier to deal with a Liberal.</p><p>The Conservatives have seen their lead in the polls evaporate in recent weeks as Trump and his trade war have become a top issue for voters,&nbsp;according to .</p><p>The poll, published last week by Ipsos Public Affairs exclusively for Global News, found if a federal election were held now, the Liberals would secure 42 per cent of decided voter support, compared with 36 per cent for the Conservatives — widening their lead over the Tories by seven points in just three weeks.</p><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><p>Poilievre has shifted his overall messages as Canadian pride surged in the face of Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada.</p><p>He’s putting less emphasis on the notion that “Canada is broken” and striking a more positive tone, vowing to “restore Canada’s promise” — the notion, he said, that “anyone from anywhere can achieve anything.”</p><p>In the Breitbart interview, Smith also discussed how she felt former prime minister Justin Trudeau got Canada “into a ditch” after his trip to Trump’s Florida estate Mar-A-Lago following the U.S. Election in November.</p><p>Smith said Trudeau made two blunders: by not ensuring Canada was meeting the two per cent military spending target for NATO, and making Canada appear fragile economically.</p><blockquote></blockquote><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><p>Williams said the comments in the interview are another bad move by the premier.</p><p>“Now that she has essentially suggested that the administration just pause the tariffs during the election — I think that in itself is problematic.</p><p>“But to also say that Pierre Poilievre aligns with the values of the Trump administration — I think that becomes quite difficult for Pierre Poilievre,” Williams said, adding it it undermines his claim that Donald Trump wouldn’t want him as prime minister.</p><p>Alberta Opposition leader Naheed Nenshi said Smith is putting politics ahead of Canadian unity.</p><p>“Danielle Smith is more than happy to placate Trump during the worst economic crisis facing our country than she is willing to work with Canadians,” Nenshi said in a post on X Sunday afternoon.</p><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><p>“Calling for a pause on tariffs to politically benefit one party or another isn’t the right approach. But standing firm for Canada is.”</p><p>With the federal election campaign officially beginning on Sunday, the Liberals are already using it against the federal Conservatives.</p><p>“With respect to the premier’s comments: I take note of her alignment of Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump and would note that that’s one of the decisions that Canadians will have to make,” said Liberal Leader Mark Carney.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>In a statement to Global News on Sunday, the premier’s office said any suggestion Smith is asking the U.S. to interfere in Canada’s election is offensive and false.</p><div><div>Story continues below advertisement</div></div><p>Smith added she has been working with other premiers in order to convey to American officials how damaging tariffs could be – and how they need to be put on hold until after an election in order to properly renegotiate CUSMA.</p><p>“Now that an election has been called I would reiterate my hope that the United States would refrain from placing tariffs on their closest ally and largest trading partner during the middle of the election,” Smith said in her statement on Sunday.</p><p>Smith was scheduled to speak at the University of Alberta for an unrelated announcement on Monday.

America","url":"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america","date":1742749825,"author":"/u/Party_Judgment5780","guid":12733,"unread":true,"content":"<p>SAN DIEGO (AP) — Lennon Tyler and her German fiancé often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day’s drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.</p><p>But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.</p><p>U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fiancé, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.</p><p>Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.</p><p>They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Brösche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.</p><p>On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.</p><p>Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.</p><p>Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s US-Mexico border program, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he’s never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.</p><p>“It’s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn’t make sense,” he said. “It doesn’t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions” they endured.</p><p>“The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,” Rios said.</p><p>Of course, tourists from countries where the U.S. requires visas — many of them non-Western nations — have long encountered difficulties entering the U.S.</p><p>U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have recently been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren’t simply denied entry.</p><h3>Weekslong lockups fuel anxieties about tourist travel to U.S.</h3><p>The incidents are&nbsp;fueling anxiety&nbsp;as the Trump administration prepares for a&nbsp;ban on travelers&nbsp;from some countries. Noting the “evolving” federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of travel for spring break, warning “re-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.”</p><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Brösche, who was held for 45 days, “were deemed inadmissible” by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but “if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.” The agencies did not comment on the other cases.</p><p>Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a program offered to&nbsp;a select group&nbsp;of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html\">getting a visa in advance</a>. Applicants register online with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/electronic-system-travel-authorization-esta\">Electronic System for Travel Authorization</a>.</p><p>But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, U.S. authorities have wide discretion to still deny entry. Following the detentions, Britain and Germany updated their travel advisories to alert people about the strict U.S. border enforcement. The United Kingdom warned “you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.”</p><p>Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler’s dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.</p><p>“Mexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,” Tyler said.</p><p>They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff’s 90-day tourist permit.</p><p>When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, “Where are you going? Where do you live?” Tyler said.</p><p>“English is not Lucas’ first language and so he said, ‘We’re going to Las Vegas,’ and the agent says, ’Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can’t do that,'” Tyler said.</p><p>Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.</p><p>After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fiancé’s whereabouts.</p><p>During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.</p><p>There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.</p><p>“You are angry, you are sad, you don’t know when you can get out,” Sielaff said. “You just don’t get any answers from anybody.”</p><p>He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.</p><h3>‘A blatant abuse’ of U.S. border authorities’ power, victims say</h3><p>“What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol’s power,” Tyler said.</p><p>Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Brösche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.</p><p>“She’s happy to be home,” Paschen said. “She seems very relieved if anything but she’s not coming back here anytime soon.”</p><p>On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker traveling across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.</p><p>On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur on a U.S. work visa, was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.</p><p>Before Mooney’s release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying: “It certainly reinforces anxiety that …&nbsp;many Canadians have&nbsp;about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.”</p><p>The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration’s arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including&nbsp;a Palestinian activist&nbsp;who helped organize&nbsp;campus protests of the war&nbsp;in Gaza.</p><p>Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.</p><p>Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas.

To invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That’s why I’m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.”</p><p>In addition to sparking a trade war with Washington’s northerly ally just days after taking office, Mr Trump <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/trump-us-canada-tariffs-state-b2713761.html\">has repeatedly insisted that Canada should become</a> the 51st state of America, and on Friday even acknowledged that he had “totally changed” the political dynamic in Canada with his threats.</p><p>Polls now suggest the Liberals, who had badly trailed the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals – who have sought to portray Mr Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. </p><p>In contrast, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections. Having served for years as his party’s go-to attack dog, the 45-year-old has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ap-canada-justin-trudeau-conservative-party-toronto-b2164639.html\">carved a niche as a firebrand populist</a> who says he will put “Canada first”, vowing to defund the country’s public broadcaster and refusing to allow media onboard his campaign buses and planes.</p><p>With a strong performance in predominantly French-speaking Quebec key to any victory, Mr Poilievre speaks flawless French, while Mr Carney recently stumbled at a press conference when asked to respond in French, misunderstanding the question before responding in English.</p><p>Mr Poilievre’s party also raised questions about how Mr Carney transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust, and will have been encouraged last week by the prime minister’s bristly response to a reporter who asked about the trust&nbsp;and who Mr Carney accused of engaging in “conflict and ill will”.</p><p>But while the Conservatives had sought to make the election about Mr Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged, Mr Carney is now hopeful that his combative approach to dealing with the White House will help him ride the wave of Canadian nationalism which has surged in response to Mr Trump’s annexation threats.</p><p>He said on Sunday: “Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn’t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen.”</p><p>Conversely, Mr Poilievre has recently been endorsed by Mr Trump’s ally Elon Musk, while his own conservative ally, Alberta premier Danielle Smith, told far-right outlet Breitbart earlier this month that Mr Poilievre would be “very much in sync” with the “new direction in America”.</p><p>Launching his campaign on Sunday, Mr Poilievre said he would be respectful but firm with Mr Trump and would “insist the president recognises the independence and sovereignty of Canada”, adding: “I will insist he stops tariffing our nation.”</p><p>“You are worried about your job and the sovereignty of our nation. And you are angry at the feeling of betrayal that these unacceptable words and tariffs have made us all experience. I <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pierre-poilievre-trump-canada-51st-state-b2699569.html\">share your anger</a> and I share the worry about our future.”</p><p>As evidenced by the focus of the two leading candidates’ remarks on Sunday, Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Canada’s Western University, said Mr Carney’s political inexperience may be of less consequence in the campaign as a result of the Trump factor.</p><p>“There’s a different kind of comparison that’s being made right between the leaders and what are they going to be able to do,” said Professor Stephenson. “I have a feeling we’re going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign.”</p><p>An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released on Monday put the Liberals on 42 per cent and the Conservatives on 37. An online Leger poll of 1,568 people for the released the same day had the Liberals on 42 per cent with the Conservatives on 39.</p><p>The election campaign for 343 seats or districts in Canada’s House of Commons will last 37 days. </p><p>While other parties are running, the Liberals and the Conservatives are the only two that have a chance to form a government. The party that commands a majority in parliament, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be the prime minister.</p>","contentLength":4738,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ji3o2u/new_canadian_prime_minister_mark_carney_calls/"},{"title":"A supporter of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu protests in front of a police cordon","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ji3iu9/a_supporter_of_istanbul_mayor_ekrem_imamoglu/","date":1742748183,"author":"/u/slima97","guid":12843,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Huge blast in Gaza City after Israeli strike","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1YtaAya3U","date":1742747603,"author":"Associated Press","guid":11137,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A huge explosion occurred next to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in Gaza City on Sunday, following an Israeli strike.

They have Crimea, and they've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" Witkoff added, not mentioning that Russia had made similar claims of not invading Ukraine prior to its full-scale invasion.</p><p>Witkoff empathized that Trump is focused on reviving their relationship with Putin over the course of peace talks.</p><p>\"Who doesn't want to have a world where Russia and the  are doing collaboratively good things together?\" he said, mentioning the prospect of doing business as usual with Russia with \"energy policies in the Arctic,\" selling natural gas to Europe and collaborating on AI.</p><p>\"That is a complicated situation, including war and all the ingredients that led up to it.

Now, the U.S. says Canadians must build their own.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/haskell-free-library-and-opera-house-canada-u-s-cross-border-separate-entrances/","date":1742737852,"author":"/u/CupidStunt13","guid":12327,"unread":true,"content":"<p>On Monday, a century-old tradition that allowed Canadians and Americans to freely access the front entrance of the <a href=\"https://www.haskelloperahouse.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Haskell Free Library and Opera House</a>&nbsp;that straddles Vermont and Quebec will come to an end.&nbsp;</p><p>Canadian members used to walk down the approximately 70 feet of American sidewalk with their identifying documents, such as a passport or license, and enter through the library's main entrance, which sits on the Vermont side. But last week, U.S. authorities said that this easy access will end, with most Canadians needing to enter through a separate entrance on Canada's side.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It's been in effect for 104 years, and suddenly, with this new administration, it's not,\" said Sonia De Paoli, 71, a Canadian who moved to the area from Montreal after she retired. De Paoli joined the library's board of trustees —&nbsp; consisting of four Americans and three Canadians — a few years ago to help this \"unique\" private organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning Monday, Canadians with proof of library membership will still be able to use the front entrance on the Vermont side, but nonmembers will need to enter through the Canadian side, the library said.&nbsp;</p><p>But by Oct. 1, all Canadians, including members, will be required to use the entrance on Canada's side — although once inside the library Canadians and Americans can still freely intermingle.&nbsp;</p><p>The private library was founded in 1901 between Stanstead, Quebec, and Derby Line, Vermont, to encourage cooperation between the border towns. The historic building, which also houses a 400-seat opera house, has thick tape running throughout its interior, denoting where the U.S. border ends and the Canadian one begins.</p><p>De Paoli said the U.S. government's unilateral decision to shut Canadians' access to the front door has left the community not feeling very good. She said some members were writing to the library and saying, \"Why do we have to use the back door? We've been doing this forever, why do we have to do this?\"</p><p>A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Reuters that the U.S. decision was in response .&nbsp;</p><p>\"Drug traffickers and smugglers were exploiting the fact that Canadians could use the U.S. entrance without going through customs. We are ending such exploitation by criminals and protecting Americans,\" the statement said.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News has reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for further information on numbers relating to drug trafficking and smuggling near the library. A CBP spokesperson confirmed to the Associated Press that it had implemented the move to restrict Canadians from the Vermont entrance.&nbsp;  </p><p>De Paoli said in the years since she'd lived in the Stanstead area, the \"world had changed\" very much, but library trustees and staff had regular meetings with CBP and Canada's Royal Canadian Mounted Police to ensure knowledge of any new border directives.&nbsp;</p><p>There haven't been any custom or trafficking incidents involving library visitors of which the trustees have been aware, De Paoli said. And she noted they were even able to keep access to the front entrance open for both nations during World War I and World War II.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We do love our neighbors,\" said De Paoli, adding that American library members are just as upset and frustrated by the news as their Canadian counterparts.</p><p>The library now needs to build out the new Canadian entrance to code — a blow to a not-for-profit organization that has existed on a limited endowment since 1908. Membership is free, says De Paoli, as are many of the other events it hosts for the rural communities surrounding the historic building. Other times, they will charge a few dollars to attend the opera or a local film festival.&nbsp;</p><p>\"For our film festivals, tickets are $5. We charge $1 for popcorn,\" De Paoli said, adding the surrounding communities are mostly rural farming areas.&nbsp;</p><p>To build out the Canadian entrance, the Haskell has to create a parking lot with reduced mobility spots, install reduced mobility access ramps and entrances, and build another proper building entrance to the facility.</p><p>The library will comply with the new directive, but said in a statement, \"We refuse to let a border divide what history has built together.\"</p><p>Costs are expected to top 100,000 Canadian dollars, De Paoli said. So far, they've raised more than half the funds through a GoFundMe page, and De Paoli said she has \"been in tears seeing donations from the communities of $5, $10, $50 from people who don't have much money but are doing it because they care.\"</p><div><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/team/cara-tabachnick/\" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=\"\">Cara Tabachnick</a><div><div><p>Cara Tabachnick is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

Seeking to rebalance US-China trade and bring manufacturing jobs home, Trump imposed tariffs on China during his first term that were kept in place by the Biden administration. Chinese manufacturers priced out of the US had&nbsp;to search for alternative markets, while some moved production to other countries&nbsp;to evade duties.\n\nBoosting exports became even more urgent when President Xi Jinping took steps around 2020 to deflate a property bubble. He then ramped up investment in manufacturing to bolster the economy, propelling China’s trade surplus to an all-time high of just under $1 trillion in 2024. While Xi’s government has signaled its intention to shift the economy more toward consumption, robust exports will still be needed this year to hit an ambitious growth target of about 5%.\n\nThe pain in countries such Indonesia is being felt in other emerging economies, and it’s only set to get worse: Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on China even higher, after hiking them by 20% since taking office in January. This means the country’s exporters, by far the most competitive in the world, are looking to replace any lost orders—a dynamic that risks unleashing an even larger flood of Chinese goods around the globe. \n\nDaniel Kurtz-Phelan, Editor of Foreign Affairs, offers his take on the US-China dynamic and whether the concept of globalism is a thing of the past.
