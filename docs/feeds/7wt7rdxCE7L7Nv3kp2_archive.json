This has greatly expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes are made.</p></blockquote><p>This is the access that the Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/the-30-year-old-internet-backdoor-law-that-came-back-to-bite/\">used</a> to spy on Americans:</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b\">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported Friday that a Chinese government hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon broke into three of the largest U.S. internet providers, including AT&amp;T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon, to access systems they use for facilitating customer data to law enforcement and governments. The hacks reportedly may have resulted in the “vast collection of internet traffic”; from the telecom and internet giants. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/chinese-hackers-us-telecoms/\">CNN</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/06/salt-typhoon-china-espionage-telecom/\">The Washington Post</a> also confirmed the intrusions and that the U.S. government’s investigation is in its early stages.</p></blockquote>","contentLength":1656,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Agentic AI in the SOC - Dawn of Autonomous Alert Triage","url":"https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/agentic-ai-in-soc-dawn-of-autonomous.html","date":1744110000,"author":"The Hacker News","guid":20390,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Security Operations Centers (SOCs) today face unprecedented alert volumes and increasingly sophisticated threats.
