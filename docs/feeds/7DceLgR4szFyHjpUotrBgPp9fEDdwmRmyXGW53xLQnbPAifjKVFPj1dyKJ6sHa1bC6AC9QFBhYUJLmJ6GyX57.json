He’s not just been very vocal about it, but also brought up some arguments against the use of C++ that are worth reviewing in detail.</p><p>C and C++ are almost the same, except they aren’t. C++ is often considered the object oriented “version” of C. The successor to it, if you will. But C++ is rather an extension to C. Bringing object orientation, constructors, destructors, templates, exception handling, namespaces and operator overloading. All these extensions come with their very own challenges and paradigms. Unsurprisingly, Linus’ technical arguments against C++ all have their roots in these extensions.</p><p>The main arguments that Linus brought forward against C++ can be found in the kernel mailing list under “<a href=\"https://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Compiling C++ kernel module + Makefile</a>” and the respective responses that date back as far as 2004. Let’s wipe the personal disputes off these messages and focus on the arguments.</p><h2>Exception handling in C++</h2><blockquote><p>“the whole C++ exception handling thing is fundamentally broken. It’s _especially_ broken for kernels.”</p></blockquote>","contentLength":1171,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iphr9s/linus_torvalds_critique_of_c_a_comprehensive/"},{"title":"Dynamic triple/double buffering merge request for GNOME was just merged!","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1441","date":1739556559,"author":"/u/joojmachine","guid":623,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipguyt/dynamic_tripledouble_buffering_merge_request_for/"},{"title":"Why does Linux open large file bases much faster than windows?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ipd8a7/why_does_linux_open_large_file_bases_much_faster/","date":1739547296,"author":"/u/AlternativeCarpet494","guid":622,"unread":true,"content":"<p>So I have a 4TB hard drive with around a 100 GB dataset on it.
