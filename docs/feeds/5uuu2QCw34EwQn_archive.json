of Moscow‚Äôs fuel supply at risk after Ukrainian drone strike on its largest oil refinery","url":"https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/03/16/frontline-report-50-of-moscows-fuel-supply-at-risk-after-ukrainian-drone-strike-on-its-largest-oil-refinery/","date":1742131916,"author":"/u/eaglemaxie","guid":390,"unread":true,"content":"<p data-start=\"51\" data-end=\"127\">Today, there are a lot of interesting updates from the Russian Federation.</p><p data-start=\"129\" data-end=\"470\">Ukrainian drones penetrated deep into Russian territory, and explosions lit up the skies over Moscow and several key cities. While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out‚Äîthe hit on the Druzhba pipeline‚Äîcreating international ripple effects beyond Russia‚Äôs borders as exports suddenly dropped.</p><p data-start=\"472\" data-end=\"900\">As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine‚Äôs strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.</p><p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1259\">This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia‚Äôs air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.</p><p data-start=\"1261\" data-end=\"1623\">What followed was Russia‚Äôs most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city‚Äôs largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.</p><h3 data-start=\"1080\" data-end=\"1160\"><strong data-start=\"1084\" data-end=\"1158\">Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disrupted</strong></h3><p data-start=\"1625\" data-end=\"1925\">Explosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force‚Äôs rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.</p><p data-start=\"1927\" data-end=\"2398\">The Druzhba pipeline‚Äîone of the world‚Äôs largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day‚Äîis a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥, called it an attack on their sovereignty.</p><p data-start=\"2400\" data-end=\"2807\">When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia‚Äôs hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.</p><p data-start=\"2809\" data-end=\"3456\">Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia‚Äôs nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia‚Äôs monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country‚Äôs electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"3458\" data-end=\"3686\">The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.</p><h3 data-start=\"2894\" data-end=\"2957\"><strong data-start=\"2898\" data-end=\"2955\">Ukraine‚Äôs strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?</strong></h3><p data-start=\"3688\" data-end=\"3919\">If Russia does not accept a ceasefire‚Äîat least in the air‚ÄîUkraine can exert much more pressure on Russia‚Äôs energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.</p><p data-start=\"3921\" data-end=\"4420\">Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow‚Äôs main refinery, which supplies half the city‚Äôs energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia‚Äôs economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire‚Äîat least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine.</p><p data-start=\"3921\" data-end=\"4420\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jzX0f8pt-pY?si=IaTnP5im_An4UTGh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><a href=\"http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FjzX0f8pt-pY%3Fsi%3DIaTnP5im_An4UTGh&amp;utm_source=chrome&amp;utm_medium=extensions&amp;utm_campaign=link_modifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"–û—Ç—Ä–∏–º–∞–π –ø—Ä—è–º–µ –ø–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—è\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><a href=\"http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FjzX0f8pt-pY%3Fsi%3DIaTnP5im_An4UTGh&amp;utm_source=chrome&amp;utm_medium=extensions&amp;utm_campaign=link_modifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"–û—Ç—Ä–∏–º–∞–π –ø—Ä—è–º–µ –ø–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—è\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><em>, we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.</em></p><div><div><strong>You could close this page.

Ralph Goodale, Canada‚Äôs high commissioner to the United Kingdom, wrote on X that there was ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù she was wearing ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs colours.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIn diplomacy, symbols are important,‚Äù Goodale added.</p><p>Nicolas Kenny, a history professor at Vancouver‚Äôs Simon Fraser University, believes that these symbolic acts ‚Äî all taking place this month ‚Äî amount to a deliberate move to highlight the relationship between Canada and the royals.</p><p>‚ÄúThe British sovereign will make these symbols and nods to various countries that are associated with the Commonwealth at different times, but the close-together accumulation of these symbols in this moment is not coincidental,‚Äù he said in a phone interview.</p><p>Kenny suggested the King‚Äôs gestures might be ‚Äúa bit of compensation‚Äù after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment on Trump‚Äôs 51st state comments during a recent visit to the White House.</p><p>However, Kenny said the King‚Äôs influence stops there, given the limits of his authority. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no political authority by any means,‚Äù he said.</p><p>Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal commentator, said the King is in the ‚Äúdelicate situation‚Äù of trying to balance the sometimes conflicting interests of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms.</p><p>As monarch, he must be ‚Äúabove politics‚Äù and cannot act without the advice of his prime minister, and Starmer ‚Äúis very focused on achieving a favourable trade relationship with the United States,‚Äù she said.</p><p>There are signs, however, that the King is paying attention to world events. Former prime minister Justin Trudeau said he and the monarch had a meeting March 3 that centred on ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs sovereign and independent future.‚Äù</p><p>Similarly, the King held a 30-minute private audience with Usher of the Black Rod J. Greg Peters and Senate Speaker Raymonde Gagn√© after Wednesday‚Äôs ceremony, in a conversation that reportedly touched on ‚Äútopics of great concern to all parties, both nationally and internationally.‚Äù</p><p>Despite not being able to comment publicly, ‚Äúa more subtle statement, such as choice of dress, publicity surrounding meetings, meetings with officials and public engagements ‚Ä¶ can remind the public that he is also King of Canada,‚Äù Harris said.</p><p>She also suggested the King could wield a more subtle diplomatic role by ‚Äúbring(ing) people together with a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds‚Äù for state visits and receptions.</p><p>The Royal Family‚Äôs diplomatic clout was on display during Starmer‚Äôs Oval Office visit, when the president was presented with an envelope containing a letter from the King inviting Trump for a state visit, possibly to be held at Balmoral, the Royal Family‚Äôs Scottish castle and estate.</p><p>Starmer noted that it was ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù for a president to get two such trips to the U.K. Trump was hosted by Queen Elizabeth in 2019, during his first term in office.</p><p>Arthur Milnes, a political speechwriter and historian, also sees a role for the monarch as a ‚Äúsounding board‚Äù for Canadian prime ministers. Queen Elizabeth and now her son, the King, both had a deep knowledge of diplomacy and history, and an absolute commitment to secrecy, he said.</p><p>‚ÄúYou quickly discover ‚Äî any prime minister will tell you ‚Äî that you can discuss anything in your audiences with the King,‚Äù he said.</p><p>In uncertain and tumultuous times, the King also serves as a symbol of stability ‚Äî and a reminder of what separates Canada from the United States, he said.</p><p>‚ÄúDonald Trump might want to be the king, but Canada actually and always will have one,‚Äù Milnes said.</p><p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 15, 2025.</p><p>Morgan Lowrie, The Canadian Press</p>","contentLength":4809,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jcgszq/king_charles_signals_support_for_canada_as_trump/"},{"title":"Trump's 200% Tariff on EU Wine, Alcohol: What Happens If It Goes Ahead?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlYX0VonjOQ","date":1742112023,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":255,"unread":true,"content":"<article>US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports would send some companies out of business, according to Ignacio Sanchez Recarte, Secretary General of the Comit√© Europ√©en des Entreprises Vins, CEEV, which represents European wine companies.
