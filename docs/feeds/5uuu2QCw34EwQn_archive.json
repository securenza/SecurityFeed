That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”</p><p>He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.</p><p>“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.</p><p>Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.</p><p>The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.</p><p>Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.</p><p>He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.</p><p>This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.</p><p>While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement. In the last parliamentary elections in 2022, a united front of anti-Fidesz candidates fell well short of Orbán’s party, which won over half of the popular vote.</p>","contentLength":2822,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jci7c2/hungarian_opposition_rallies_in_massive_protest/"},{"title":"Finland turns down US request for eggs","url":"https://yle.fi/a/74-20149786","date":1742116052,"author":"/u/Beo1217","guid":606,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jchh9z/finland_turns_down_us_request_for_eggs/"},{"title":"Trump's 200% Tariff on EU Wine, Alcohol: What Happens If It Goes Ahead?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlYX0VonjOQ","date":1742112023,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":451,"unread":true,"content":"<article>US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports would send some companies out of business, according to Ignacio Sanchez Recarte, Secretary General of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins, CEEV, which represents European wine companies.

Minister Carney orders review of F-35 fighter jet purchase from U.S.’s Lockheed Martin","url":"https://montreal.citynews.ca/2025/03/15/carney-orders-review-of-f-35-fighter-jet-purchase-from-u-s-s-lockheed-martin/","date":1742059810,"author":"/u/BonkMcSlapchop","guid":604,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada’s plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets.</p><p>The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each.</p><p>A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada given the “changing environment,” or if there are better options.</p><p>“At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft,” Laurent de Casanove said in a statement to CityNews. “The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs.”</p><p>“To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract.” </p><p>Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, “particularly where there may be opportunities” to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada.</p><p>“The direction I’ve been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada,” he said.</p><p>Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners “to see what is possible.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments.&nbsp;</p><p>“Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.</p><h2>On-again, off-again decision to buy F-35s</h2><p>The Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition in 2010, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider.</p><p>Then, in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35 at all.</p><p>The government planned to buy 18 Super Hornets without a competition as an “interim” measure but cancelled the plan after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier.</p><p>Ottawa initiated an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019.</p><p>In January 2023, Canada announced it would buy the F-35 fighter jet with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.</p><p>At the time, Defence Minister Anita Anand called the F-35 the best choice for Canada.</p><h2>A mixed fleet of planes ‘less disruptive, but costly and complex’</h2><p>Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued that Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them.</p><p>He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should “cut its losses.”</p><p>“We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems,” he said.</p><p>Philippe Lagassé, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a “large scale transition underway” from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn’t only include the planes, but also the also the “infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America.”</p><p>Lagassé, who also served as a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking.</p><p>“It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time,” he said.</p><p>Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane “would be less disruptive, but costly and complex.”</p><p>The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion. A 2023 report estimated the acquisition phase would cost $19.8 billion, including $10.7 billion for 88 planes, $2.1 billion for weapons and ammunition and $5.9 billion for elements like design and depot costs, infrastructure and training.</p>","contentLength":4889,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jc0co6/prime_minister_carney_orders_review_of_f35/"},{"title":"Cubans left in the dark after electrical grid fails | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_90BNmejGo","date":1742059223,"author":"Reuters","guid":481,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Cuba's national electrical grid collapsed late on Friday, leading to blackouts across the country.\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #cuba #powercuts \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3RbJT2h\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":505,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/W_90BNmejGo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Women playfully tear men’s clothes in age-old Holi celebration | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKAuPqMrSOo","date":1742059093,"author":"Reuters","guid":480,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Thousands gathered at a Hindu temple in northern India to play 'Huranga', where women tear men's clothes and beat them as part of Holicelebrations.\n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed #holi #india \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4krGFFp\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":550,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/bKAuPqMrSOo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Peruvian farmer sues German energy firm over melting glaciers | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcZZ4Z292w4","date":1742058991,"author":"Reuters","guid":479,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A Peruvian farmer is suing a German energy company over climate change’s role in melting glaciers where he lives.

In&nbsp;November 2024, President Zelenskyy mentioned that Ukraine had reached the production milestone of&nbsp;over 100&nbsp;missile units.</p><p>Ukraine has previously employed the Neptune missile in&nbsp;strikes against Russian military infrastructure.
