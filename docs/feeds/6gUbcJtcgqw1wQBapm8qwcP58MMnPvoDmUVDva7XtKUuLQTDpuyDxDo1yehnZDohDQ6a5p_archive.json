Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. \nThe reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: \n\n- \"2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers...\" — Daniel Almedia \n\n- \"I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time.\" — Andrea Righi\n\n - \"[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs.\" — Carlos Bilbao \n\n- \"I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete...\" Steven Rostedt \n\nRostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. \"I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language.\" \n\nBut still \"contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps,\" argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:\n\n\"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain.\" \n\nBut the article also notes that Google \"has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones.\"\nThe use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. \"Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones,\" Ojeda told me after his talk. \n\nIn addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as \"maintainers become more comfortable with it,\" Ojeda told me. \"Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now,\" Ojeda said. \"If they could drop C, they would do it....\" \n\nAmid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.","contentLength":4153,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"C++ on Steroids: Bjarne Stroustrup Presents Guideline-Enforcing 'Profiles' For Resource and Type Safety","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/09/0636247/c-on-steroids-bjarne-stroustrup-presents-guideline-enforcing-profiles-for-resource-and-type-safety?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1739102640,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":286,"unread":true,"content":"\"It is now 45+ years since C++ was first conceived,\" writes 74-year-old C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup in an article this week for Communications of the ACM.

The move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name. Deno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community. This legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term \"JavaScript\" in a conference title or business venture.\n \n\"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations,\" the website explains. \"These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around -- for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world's most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name.\" [...] In the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of \"JavaScript.\" The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.\n \nOracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term \"in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer's guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term.\" The fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product. \"Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner's Chief Executive Officer,\" the trademark cancellation petition says. \"Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle.\"\n \nOracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO -- a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend. \"Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material,\" Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented. Beyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.","contentLength":3388,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"NetChoice Sues To Block Maryland's Kids Code, Saying It Violates the First Amendment","url":"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/02/03/2028246/netchoice-sues-to-block-marylands-kids-code-saying-it-violates-the-first-amendment?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1738616400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":283,"unread":true,"content":"NetChoice has filed (PDF) its 10th lawsuit challenging state internet regulations, this time opposing Maryland's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act. The Verge's Lauren Feiner reports: NetChoice has become one of the fiercest -- and most successful -- opponents of age verification, moderation, and design code laws, all of which would put new obligations on tech platforms and change how users experience the internet. [...] NetChoice's latest suit opposes the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a rule that echoes a California law of a similar name. In the California litigation, NetChoice notched a partial win in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the district court's decision to block a part of the law requiring platforms to file reports about their services' impact on kids. (It sent another part of the law back to the lower court for further review.)\n \nA similar provision in Maryland's law is at the center of NetChoice's complaint. The group says that Maryland's reporting requirement lets regulators subjectively determine the \"best interests of children,\" inviting \"discriminatory enforcement.\" The reporting requirement on tech companies essentially mandates them \"to disparage their services and opine on far-ranging and ill-defined harms that could purportedly arise from their services' 'design' and use of information,\" NetChoice alleges. NetChoice points out that both California and Maryland have passed separate online privacy laws, which NetChoice Litigation Center director Chris Marchese says shows that \"lawmakers know how to write laws to protect online privacy when what they want to do is protect online privacy.\"\n \nSupporters of the Maryland law say legislators learned from California's challenges and \"optimized\" their law to avoid questions about speech, according to Tech Policy Press. In a blog analyzing Maryland's approach, Future of Privacy Forum points out that the state made some significant changes from California's version -- such as avoiding an \"express obligationâ to determine users' ages and defining the \"best interests of children.\" The NetChoice challenge will test how well those changes can hold up to First Amendment scrutiny. NetChoice has consistently maintained that even well-intentioned attempts to protect kids online are likely to backfire. Though the Maryland law does not explicitly require the use of specific age verification tools, Marchese says it essentially leaves tech platforms with a no-win decision: collect more data on users to determine their ages and create varied user experiences or cater to the lowest common denominator and self-censor lawful content that might be considered inappropriate for its youngest users. And similar to its arguments in other cases, Marchese worries that collecting more data to identify users as minors could create a \"honey pot\" of kids' information, creating a different problem in attempting to solve another.","contentLength":2938,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Should We Sing the Praises of Agile, or Bury It?","url":"https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1948240/should-we-sing-the-praises-of-agile-or-bury-it?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1738528440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":282,"unread":true,"content":"\"Stakeholders must be included\" throughout an agile project \"to ensure the evolving deliverables meet their expectations,\" according to an article this week in Communications of the ACM. \n\nBut long-time Slashdot reader theodp complains it's a \"gushing how-to-make-Agile-even-better opinion piece.\"\n\nLike other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management \"has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility\" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development.
