Their most noticeable use is on social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Some of these fancy styles not only have aesthetics but are also attention-grabbing, which is why you might have encountered them while scrolling through your feeds. Below we have featured some of the coolest fonts that you can use to make your next text stylish.\n</p><div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-1\">\nCursive also known as script font with its handwriting-like style makes it one of the most eye-pleasing text styles. Its flowing design can add a touch of elegance to your writing, making it perfect for highlighting specific parts of your text. For example, you can conclude a message with \"𝒯𝒽𝒶𝓃𝓀 𝓎ℴ𝓊\". Additionally, it works well for brief, heartfelt messages; for instance, sending a \"𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 😊\" to your mother would be a wonderful way to start her day.\n</div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-2\">\nGothic font, also known as Fraktur or Blackletter, has the classic vibe of Old English text. With its sharp and angular design, it provides an aesthetic historical feel. Fraktur font has a bold and sophisticated appearance, making it an excellent choice for titles, headings, or for emphasizing parts of the text. For instance, you might wish your friend a great start to the season by writing, \"𝕲𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖙 𝕭𝖊𝖌𝖌𝖎𝖓𝖎𝖓𝖌\".\n</div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-3\">\nOne of the most  created using Unicode symbols is the Bold font. We often feel the urge to make certain parts of our text bold to highlight their importance, but many online communities do not have this option. With the text generator, it’s now super easy to emphasize your text and copy-paste it in bold format. Simply enter the text you want to highlight and choose from many available options, including 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝘀-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱, 𝑩𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝑰𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒄, 𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝, and some cooler styles like 𝓢𝓬𝓻𝓲𝓹𝓽 and 𝕱𝖗𝖆𝖐𝖙𝖚𝖗. For example, you might share an inspiring quote \"𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞.\" – 𝐔𝐧𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐧.\n</div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-4\">\nMonospace is a beautiful-looking font style with its characters taking up the same amount of horizontal space. Unlike other fonts with characters having varying widths, monospace characters maintain the same width. This type of text style can create a clean, minimalist appearance and adds a nostalgic typewriter feel. Monospace text can be useful when sharing lists, instructions, or information such as a URL, for example 𝚑𝚝𝚝𝚙𝚜://𝚎𝚡𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎.𝚌𝚘𝚖.𝚌𝚘𝚖/. It can enhance the clarity of your text.\n</div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-5\">\nCircled or bubble text is a cool-looking font style with each character enclosed in a circle. This font style gives a fun feel which makes it a good choice for informal and creative uses. It has two variants 🅓🅐🅡🅚 and normal Ⓑⓤⓑⓑⓛⓔ text style. It can add a cheerful touch to your social media posts, comments, or messages. For example, you could use it to announce something exciting on your Instagram page with a caption Ⓝⓔⓦ ⒶⓡⓡⓘⓥⒶⓛ or 🅒🅞🅝🅖🅡🅐🅣🅤🅛🅐🅣🅔 a close friend to make their day.\n</div><div role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"ex2-tab-6\">\nSquare text is a modern-looking font style with each character being enclosed in a block. Its modern and striking look is a great way to capture attention on social media. You can create unique headlines and emphasize key points with this style. For example, you can use it to announce updates like 🆆🅸🅽🆃🅴🆁 🆂🅰🅻🅴 on your page or send fun messages to friends, such as 🅶🅾🅾🅳 🅽🅸🅶🅷🆃. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing look is a perfect way to add a trendy look to your text.\n</div></div><h2>Uses of Copy and Paste Fonts\n</h2><p>Our Stylish text generator can help you  for social media and make it fun for your chats.

Since Twitter does not offer default text styling options, this font text generator can be your go-to tool for . You can bold your text, underline it, italicize it, or even change its font completely using styles like Monospace.\n</p><p>You can make your WhatsApp or other chats more fun and engaging by using stylish text. For instance, to stress a key point, try strong fonts like \"𝐁𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐩 𝟏𝟎𝐩𝐦.\" Make your greetings special with something like \"𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 🌤️.\" When sending invitations, sprinkle in these unique text styles or save them for a personal signature, such as \"– 𝒀𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒃𝒓𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓.\" Plus, in group chats, these eye-catching fonts can help you stand out.\n</p><p>\nStyling text is not just for alphabets, you can take it a step further by making your number stylish. The next time you create a list in your notes or post on social media, consider using circled numbers like ❶❷❸ for a unique effect. When sharing a date, you can enhance it by writing it as \"Join Us on 𝟐𝟖𝐭𝐡 𝐉𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲.\" You can use cool numbers for announcements or for countdowns such as \"⑤ days to go.\" To copy fancy , simply enter the digits in the text box and choose from different fonts.\n</p><p>\nIf you run an online business, you can create eye-catching promotional headlines with stylish fonts for your page, website, or email campaigns. Announce your new products with creativity, like, \"𝓝𝓮𝔀 𝓗𝓪𝓲𝓻 𝓞𝓲𝓵 𝓲𝓷 𝓢𝓽𝓸𝓻𝓮!\" or highlight discounts with impact, such as \"𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 𝟓𝟎% 𝐎𝐟𝐟.\" Promote your webinars and include compelling calls to action in your posts or ads, like \"👉 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐔𝐩.\" These copy-paste fonts make it easy to grab attention in your promotional content.\n</p><p>\nText symbols can add a spark of fun to your educational experience. When writing notes in a simple app, you can highlight key concepts and craft creative headings. You can also write inspiring quotes in bold to motivate yourself throughout your studies.

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.</p><p>A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be \"solved\" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.</p><p>The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.</p><p>Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.</p><p>Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:\n1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)\n2. Generate Python code to perform their next action\n3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)</p><p>We provide two main evaluation settings:\n- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources\n- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated map</p><p>We found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments.

There are several benefits for building fully\nin-browser applications:</p><ul><li>y: Users’ data never leaves their devices, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality.</li><li>: An in-browser application that uses Wasm-based components\ncan run in any browser in a completely serverless manner.</li><li>: Eliminating frontend-server communication can lead to a significantly faster and\nmore interactive user experience.</li></ul><p>With this in mind, let’s now demonstrate how to develop a relatively complex AI application completely in\nthe browser! We’ll build a  chatbot that uses graph retrieval- augmented\ngeneration (Graph RAG) to answer natural language questions. We demonstrate this using\n<a href=\"https://docs.kuzudb.com/client-apis/wasm/#installation\">Kuzu-Wasm</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm\">WebLLM</a>.</p><p>The high-level architecture of the application looks as follows:\n<img src=\"https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/graph-rag.png\" width=\"400\"></p><p>The term “Graph RAG” is used to refer to several techniques but in its simplest form the term\nrefers to a 3-step retrieval approach. The goal is to retrieve useful context from a graph DBMS (GDBMS)\nto help an LLM answer natural language questions.\nIn our application, the additional data is information about\na user’s LinkedIn data consisting of their contacts, messages, companies the user or their contacts worked for. Yes, you can download\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data\">your own LinkedIn data</a> (and you should, if\nfor nothing else, to see how much of your data they have!).\nThe schema of the graph database we use to model this data will be shown below momentarily. First, let’s go over the 3 steps of\nGraph RAG:</p><ol><li>Q Q: A user asks a natural language question Q, such as “<em>Which of my contacts work at Google?</em>“.\nThen, using an LLM, this question is converted to a Cypher query, e.g., <code>MATCH (a:Company)&lt;-[:WorksAt]-(b:Contact) WHERE a.name = \"Google\" RETURN b</code>,\nthat aims to retrieve relevant data stored in the GDBMS to answer this question.</li><li>Q Context: Q is executed in the GBMS and a set of records is retrieved, e.g., “Karen” and “Alice”. Let’s call these retrieved records “Context”.</li><li>(Q + Context)  A: Finally, the original Q is given to the LLM along with the retrieved context and the LLM produces a natural language answer A,\ne.g., “<em>Karen and Alice work at Google.</em>”</li></ol><p>The schema for our personal LinkedIn data’s graph is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/schema.png\" width=\"400\"><ol><li>Upload CSV Files: Users drag and drop their LinkedIn CSV files, which are stored in Kuzu-Wasm’s virtual file system.</li><li>Initial Processing: Using Kuzu’s  feature, the raw CSVs are converted into JavaScript objects.</li><li>Normalization: In JavaScript, we clean and standardize the data by fixing timestamps, formatting dates, and resolving inconsistent URIs.</li><li>Data Insertion: The cleaned data is inserted back into Kuzu-Wasm as a set of nodes and relationships.</li></ol><p>Our code follows the exact 3 steps above. Specifically, we prompt WebLLM twice, once to create a Cypher query Q,\nwhich is sent to Kuzu-Wasm.\nWe adapted the prompts from our <a href=\"https://github.com/kuzudb/langchain-kuzu/\">LangChain-Kuzu integration</a>,\nwith a few modifications. Importantly, we make sure to include the schema information of the LinkedIn database from Kuzu in the prompt, which helps the LLM better understand\nthe structure and relationships (including the directionality of the relationships) in the dataset.</p><p>In this example, we represented the schema as YAML instead of raw, stringified JSON in the LLM prompt.\nIn our anecdotal experience, for Text-to-Cypher tasks that require reasoning over the schema, we find that LLMs tend do better\nwith YAML syntax than they do with stringified JSON. More experiments on such Text-to-Cypher tasks will be shown in future blog posts.</p><p>It’s indeed impressive to see such a graph-based pipeline with LLMs being done entirely in the browser! There are, however, some caveats.\nMost importantly, in the browser, resources are restricted, which limits the sizes of different components of your application.\nFor example, the size of the LLM you can use is limited. We tested our implementation on a MacBook Pro 2023 and a Chrome browser.\nWe had to choose the <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC</code> model (see <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC\">here</a> for the model card),\nwhich is an instruction-tuned model in MLC format. The  format is the smallest of the Llama 3.1 models that has 8B parameters\n(the largest has 450B parameters, which is of course too large to run in the browser).\nFor simple queries, the model performed quite well. It correctly generated Cypher queries for the LinkedIn data, such as:</p><ul><li>How many companies did I follow?</li><li>Which contacts work at Kùzu, Inc?</li></ul><img src=\"https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/successful-generations.png\"><p>However, we saw that for more complex queries requiring joins, filtering, and aggregation, the model struggled to return a valid Cypher query.\nIt often produced incorrect or incomplete Cypher queries for questions like: “Who endorsed me the most times?“.\nToken generation is also far slower than what you may be used to in state-of-the art interfaces,\nsuch as ChatGPT. In our experiments, we observed a speed of 15-20 tokens/sec, so generating answers took on average, around 10s.</p><p>We have deployed this demo so you can test it in your browser:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://wasm-linkedin-example.kuzudb.com\">Live Demo</a>: Drag and drop your <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339364/downloading-your-account-data\">LinkedIn data dump</a> into\nthe app and start querying your personal graph. The demo also visualizes your data in a node-link graph view using </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/kuzudb/wasm-linkedin-example\">GitHub Repository</a>: The source code is openly available so you can experiment with it further. If you see better results with different models/prompts, we’d love to hear it!</li></ul><p>Once the data is loaded, you can see a visualization that looks something like this:</p><img src=\"https://blog.kuzudb.com/img/2025-02-27-kuzu-wasm-rag/landing-page.png\"><p>The key takeaway from this post is that such advanced pipelines that utilize graph databases and LLMs are now possible .\nWe expect that many of the performance limitations of today will improve over time, with the wider adoption of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/\">WebGPU</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64\">Wasm64</a>, and other <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals?tab=readme-ov-file\">proposals</a>\nto improve Wasm. LLMs are also rapidly getting smaller &amp; better, and before we know it, it will be possible to use very advanced LLMs\nin the browser. The next release of Kuzu will include a native vector index (it’s already available\nin our nightly build; see <a href=\"https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/pull/4578\">this PR</a> for how to use it!).\nAs a result, you can also store the embeddings of documents\nalong with actual node and relationship records to enhance your graph retrievals, entirely within Kuzu.\nUsing our upcoming vector index,\nyou’ll be able to try all sorts of interesting RAG techniques, coupled with Kuzu-Wasm, all within the browser while keeping your data private.\nThe sky is the limit!</p>","contentLength":7347,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43321523"}],"tags":["dev","hn"]}
