But for years, the valuable humus layer has been thinning. Farmers in Brandenburg are clearly feeling the effects of this on their sandy fields. Many are now taking steps to prepare their farms for the future.\n\nYears of drought, record rainfall and failed harvests: we are becoming increasingly aware of how sensitively our environment reacts to extreme weather conditions. Farmers' livelihoods are at stake. So is the ability of consumers to afford food. \nFor a few years now, agriculture that focuses solely on maximum yields has been regarded with increasing skepticism. It is becoming more and more clear just how dependent we are on healthy soils.\nBrandenburg is the federal state with the worst soil quality in Germany. The already thin, fertile humus layer has been shrinking for decades. Researchers and farmers who are keen to experiment are combating these developments and looking for solutions. Priority is being given to building up the humus layer, which consists of microorganisms and fungi, as well as springtails, small worms and centipedes. \nFor Lena and Philipp Adler, two young vegetable farmers, the tiny soil creatures are invaluable helpers. On their three-hectare organic farm, they rely on simple, mechanical weed control, fallow areas where the soil can recover, and diversity. Conventional farmer Mark Dümichen also does everything he can to protect soil life on his land. For years, he has not tilled the soil after the harvest and sows directly into the field. His yields have stabilized since he began to work this way.\nIsabella Krause from Regionalwert AG Berlin-Brandenburg is convinced after the experiences of the last hot summers that new crops will thrive on Brandenburg's fields in the long term. She has founded a network of farmers who are promoting the cultivation of chickpeas with support from the scientific community. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #agriculture \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome’s port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.\n\nOne key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.\n\nPublic temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces.

Its canopy of leaves, almost 50 meters high, towers over the crowns of the forest. The tree shapes the myths of the indigenous Wayana people.\n\nWith over 80,000 plant species and hundreds of thousands of animal species, the Amazon rainforest is a green ocean of life. In the midst of this ecosystem, the kapok tree provides both shelter and crucial spaces for reproduction. Numerous animal species could not survive without the kapok tree. \nDragonflies and damselflies buzz around the spines on its trunk to lay their larvae in the bromeliad ‘air plants’ that grow on the tree. Here, the smallest influences the largest - and vice versa. Bromeliad plants do double duty, acting as floating water reservoirs: they store up to 50,000 liters of water per hectare of forest.\n\nWhen the forest floor is under water during the rainy season, the fish become gardeners. They feed on the seeds that have fallen from the trees and spread them all over the Amazon region. The kapok tree is firmly anchored in the ground with its huge roots until the next dry season. The whole forest breathes, from the moss on the ground to the treetops. This gas exchange makes life on earth possible. But dangers such as deforestation and climate change threaten this unique ecosystem.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #amazonrainforest #kapok  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could the collapse of the empire’s Old Kingdom provide any clues? [Originally aired in 2019]\n\nFollowing the long reign of Pepi II, a series of weak kings ruled ineffectively.

As the climate shifted all over the world, the country was then hit by a decades-long drought that caused a great famine and economic failure.\n\nGo behind the scenes with archaeologists and scientists as they venture through Africa – from the Pyramids to the glaciers of Mt.

Since the beginning of time, obtaining food has been one of the most important activities of mankind. Research using new methods for examining and analyzing human fossils reveals previously unknown facets of prehistoric man. The results demonstrate the central role that food plays in the anatomical, genetic and social evolution of humans.\nUntil the beginning of agriculture in the Neolithic period, the first humans fed on what nature provided for them. Their diet shaped their evolution and humanity as we know it today.\nThis two-part documentary invites you on a journey into the past and shows the complexity and diversity of prehistoric life based on scientific findings from around the world. Suzana Herculano-Houzel explains how the cooking of food influenced the mental performance of early humans. Delphine Vettese from the Natural History Museum in Paris shows how cutting techniques for mincing meat and scraping out bone marrow were passed down from generation to generation. João Zilhão and Ernestina Badal present the results of their research into prehistoric food remains.\nFrom archaeological sites in the Dordogne to Portugal, the USA and Jordan, the film shows spectacular images of caves, semi-caves and other prehistoric sites in nature.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #archaeology #food #ancestors #stoneage \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.\n\nNext, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.\n\n• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming\n• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses\n• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features\n• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes\n• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 Overview\n02:06 Kafka is the standard for operational data\n03:41 Iceberg for analytical data in data lakes\n04:42 Apache Iceberg\n05:27 Why Iceberg?\n12:24 Structure of an Iceberg table\n16:40 Streaming to data lakes is complicated\n20:47 Tableflow materialize Kafka topics as Iceberg tables\n23:47 Demo\n35:37 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2024/sessions/3370\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Sriskandarajah Suhothayan • Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications • https://amzn.to/3szGx0p\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Prabath Siriwardena • Microservices for the Enterprise • https://amzn.to/40FhxkQ\nKasun Indrasiri • Beginning WSO2 ESB • https://amzn.to/3sx9NF0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #ApacheIceberg #Iceberg #AmazonAthena #DataStreaming #DataLake #DataWarehouse #ACIDTransactions #KafkaStreams #Confluent #Tableflow #ConfluentTableflow #KasunIndrasiri\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!\n\nShouldn’t the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What’s in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went “bang”? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. \n\nWhat can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe’s invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. \n\nAs the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.\n\nFinally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Charles Liu\n02:15 - Why Don’t Gas Clouds Disperse? \n10:01 - What Went “Bang”?\n22:56 - What Will We Learn From Gravitational Waves? \n31:15 - Do Particles Ever Touch? \n39:55 - Observing Early Generation Stars\n46:28 - Could Slowing Time Make You More Massive? \n49:57 - Closing\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.\n\nAfter two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichstätt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a \"mission donation.” High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.\n\nLawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops’ Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: \"People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.” Janssen regards such practices as \"a form of obstruction of justice”. No consideration at all was given to the victims. \n\nSo did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #catholic #church #germany #southamerica \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

From the Egyptians to the Romans, to the Chinese, oil lamps were common in the cities of ancient civilizations. The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. \n\nBut most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn’t only true for nocturnal creatures. We are also affected by exposure to artificial light and can develop serious conditions because of it, like sleep disorders, diabetes and even cancer. \n\nWatch the documentary on our channel.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #light #lightpollution #insects \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":1096,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/hYYw87lpn-A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From XP to TCR & Limbo • Kent Beck & Daniel Terhorst-North • GOTO 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48g7CRlMUD8","date":1739278805,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":122,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/articles/355\n\nKent Beck - Software Engineer &amp; Creator of Extreme Programming @KentLBeck \nDaniel Terhorst-North - Originator of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) &amp; Principal at Dan North &amp; Associates @daniel-terhorst-north \n\nRESOURCES\nKent\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/kentbeck.bsky.social\nhttps://www.kentbeck.com\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck\nhttps://twitter.com/KentBeck\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kentbeck\n\nDaniel\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/tastapod.com\nhttps://twitter.com/tastapod\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/danielterhorstnorth\nhttps://github.com/tastapod\nhttps://mastodon.social/@tastapod\nhttp://dannorth.net/blog\n\nLinks\nhttps://youtu.be/tgaKAF_eiOg\nhttps://youtu.be/k9lwn-RqEsE\nhttps://youtu.be/Saaz6D1azlU\nhttps://youtu.be/lOcXdXRxFgA\nhttps://youtu.be/klqo1oPdbpM\nhttps://youtu.be/ShAzlhS_TCg\nhttps://youtu.be/86-Dy5U2p5Y\nhttps://youtu.be/yuEbZYKgZas\nhttps://youtu.be/-4Ybn0Cz2oU\nhttps://youtu.be/XShcmCBK93E\n\nDESCRIPTION\nKent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development.

Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be? \n\n\nSupport our work.

Why is this happening?\n\nIn the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:49 Rome – Why are young people fans of fascism?\n02:50 Rome – At the HQ of Forza Nouva\n04:00 An expert’s take - Prof Hurrelmann\n04:42 Netherlands – A dinner party with right-populists\n07:00 Netherlands – How right-wing populists use social media\n08:41 Germany – Protests against Alternative of Germany\n09:20 Germany – Inside an AfD rally\n10:47 Simple answers to complex issues?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #politics #elections #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
