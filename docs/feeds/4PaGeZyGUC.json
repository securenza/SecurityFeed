Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
