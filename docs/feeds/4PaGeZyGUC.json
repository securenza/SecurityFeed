But there is as much, if not more, value in understanding existing code - particularly long-lived, large, and complex legacy systems.\n\nAt Thoughtworks we have been experimenting with using this technology with our clients, embodied in a tool called CodeConcise, which combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from the abstract syntax trees of a codebase. We have found this useful both to draw out low-level requirements and to build a high-level explanation of a system.\n\nThis talk will show what we have learned and how it could change the age old challenge of wrangling legacy at speed, iteratively and with zero downtime.

Hundreds of children of members of Islamic State (IS) are stuck in Syrian camps. Often, with no hope of returning to their home nations.\n\nAround 38,000 foreign nationals - more than 60 per cent of whom are children - are being held in Al-Hol and Roj, two closed, sprawling camps in north-eastern Syria that have been holding mostly spouses, other adult female relatives and children of male IS suspects since 2019. \nMost of the children are under 14 years old and many have spent most, if not all, of their lives in the camps. Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #children\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O‚ÄôReilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future ‚Äì and take Neil to task on his own predictions.\n\nThe conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon‚Äôs robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here ‚Äì and what did sci-fi get wrong?\n\nWe break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we‚Äôre headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. \n\nPlus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?\n\nLooking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry?

The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men‚Äôs claims. \n\nThe documentary picks up the story of the two men‚Äôs legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade‚Äôs and James‚Äôs civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. \n\nThe documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. \n\nMaterial for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.\n\nDirected by Dan Reed\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

This all sounds cool, until the oxygen runs out... \n\n#kurzgesagt\n#inanutshell #kurzgesagt_inanutshell #learnwithshorts #science #invertedearth #whatif \n\nSources &amp; further reading: \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/kgs-tiktok-sources\n\nFollow us for more sciencey content! ü¶Ü\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ‚ù§ https://shop.kgs.link/shorts\nBecome a Part of kurzgesagt by joining the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook</article>","contentLength":2327,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/joYJahY4FUI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This is the most common way to get head lice - Nazzy Pakpour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-EEp5xiF6Q","date":1741878037,"author":"TED-Ed","guid":132,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Dig into what makes head lice so difficult to get rid of, and the effectiveness of our most common treatments.\n\n--\n\nFor as long as humans have had lice, we‚Äôve fought hard to get rid of them.

They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \"fighting animals\" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n07:40 Who's \"Optimizing Cloud Native Java\" for?\n09:29 Performance tuning: Art &amp; science\n21:43 Java performance\n32:21 Concurrency in modern Java\n39:10 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans &amp; Jim Gough ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Cloud Native Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41nivD9\nBen Evans, Jason Clark &amp; David Flanagan ‚Ä¢ Java in a Nutshell ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43FDoMA\nBen Evans, Martijn Verburg &amp; Jason Clark ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41JMG7N\nBen Evans, Jim Gough &amp; Chris Newland ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh\nBen Evans &amp; Martijn Verburg ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk\nGoetz, Peierls, Bloch, Bowbeer, Holmes &amp; Lea ‚Ä¢ Java Concurrency in Practice ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4215zo6\nVenkat Subramaniam ‚Ä¢ Cruising Along with Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4dFuBwU\nMonica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PerformanceEngineering #JVM #JVMPerformanceEngineering #Observability #HardwareInnovation #Java #JavaProgramming #JavaPerformance #JavaConcurrency #Concurrency #CloudNative #CloudNativeJava #GraalVM #Quarkus #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #BenEvans #Kittylyst #HollyCummins #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n\n[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience.

Bring up the railguns, let‚Äôs finish this and go home.‚Äô - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015\n\nElectromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.\n\nThe lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.\n\nThis will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n‚öîWebsite: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n‚öîBlog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n‚öîFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n‚öîTwitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n‚öî Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick‚Äôs crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.\n\nIn this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.\n\nWe discuss Hakeem‚Äôs role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA‚Äôs IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn‚Äôt wear gold.\n\nThen, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe‚Äôs expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Hakeem Oluseyi\n03:30 - The Astronomical Society @astrosocietypac \n9:31 - IMAP\n14:32 - How Do We Resolve Hubble Tension?\n25:25 - Detecting Atmospheres of Distant Planets\n27:29 - Better Tools or Better Physics to Unlock Dark Matter\n32:41 - Can Gravitational Waves Alter Time? \n37:30 - What is the Conservation of Information?\n41:01 - The Big Squeeze\n41:36 - Get Those Dyson Spheres Out of Your Head\n44:38 - Closing Thoughts\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!
