While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out—the hit on the Druzhba pipeline—creating international ripple effects beyond Russia’s borders as exports suddenly dropped.</p><p data-start=\"472\" data-end=\"900\">As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine’s strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.</p><p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1259\">This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia’s air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.</p><p data-start=\"1261\" data-end=\"1623\">What followed was Russia’s most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city’s largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.</p><h3 data-start=\"1080\" data-end=\"1160\"><strong data-start=\"1084\" data-end=\"1158\">Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disrupted</strong></h3><p data-start=\"1625\" data-end=\"1925\">Explosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force’s rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.</p><p data-start=\"1927\" data-end=\"2398\">The Druzhba pipeline—one of the world’s largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day—is a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, called it an attack on their sovereignty.</p><p data-start=\"2400\" data-end=\"2807\">When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia’s hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.</p><p data-start=\"2809\" data-end=\"3456\">Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia’s nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia’s monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country’s electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.</p><p data-start=\"3458\" data-end=\"3686\">The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.</p><h3 data-start=\"2894\" data-end=\"2957\"><strong data-start=\"2898\" data-end=\"2955\">Ukraine’s strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?</strong></h3><p data-start=\"3688\" data-end=\"3919\">If Russia does not accept a ceasefire—at least in the air—Ukraine can exert much more pressure on Russia’s energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.</p><p data-start=\"3921\" data-end=\"4420\">Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow’s main refinery, which supplies half the city’s energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia’s economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire—at least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine.</p><p data-start=\"3921\" data-end=\"4420\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jzX0f8pt-pY?si=IaTnP5im_An4UTGh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><a href=\"http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FjzX0f8pt-pY%3Fsi%3DIaTnP5im_An4UTGh&amp;utm_source=chrome&amp;utm_medium=extensions&amp;utm_campaign=link_modifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Отримай пряме посилання\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><a href=\"http://savefrom.net/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FjzX0f8pt-pY%3Fsi%3DIaTnP5im_An4UTGh&amp;utm_source=chrome&amp;utm_medium=extensions&amp;utm_campaign=link_modifier\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Отримай пряме посилання\" rel=\"noopener\"></a><em>, we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.</em></p><div><div><strong>You could close this page.

That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”</p><p>He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.</p><p>“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.</p><p>Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.</p><p>The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.</p><p>Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.</p><p>He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.</p><p>This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.</p><p>While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement.

Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada’s plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets.</p><p>The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each.</p><p>A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada given the “changing environment,” or if there are better options.</p><p>“At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft,” Laurent de Casanove said in a statement to CityNews. “The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs.”</p><p>“To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract.” </p><p>Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, “particularly where there may be opportunities” to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada.</p><p>“The direction I’ve been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada,” he said.</p><p>Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners “to see what is possible.”</p><p>A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments.&nbsp;</p><p>“Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future,” the company said in a statement.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.</p><h2>On-again, off-again decision to buy F-35s</h2><p>The Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition in 2010, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider.</p><p>Then, in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35 at all.</p><p>The government planned to buy 18 Super Hornets without a competition as an “interim” measure but cancelled the plan after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier.</p><p>Ottawa initiated an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019.</p><p>In January 2023, Canada announced it would buy the F-35 fighter jet with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.</p><p>At the time, Defence Minister Anita Anand called the F-35 the best choice for Canada.</p><h2>A mixed fleet of planes ‘less disruptive, but costly and complex’</h2><p>Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued that Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them.</p><p>He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should “cut its losses.”</p><p>“We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems,” he said.</p><p>Philippe Lagassé, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a “large scale transition underway” from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn’t only include the planes, but also the also the “infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America.”</p><p>Lagassé, who also served as a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking.</p><p>“It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time,” he said.</p><p>Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane “would be less disruptive, but costly and complex.”</p><p>The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion.
