The reason I knew this is that <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/pete-hegseth/\">Pete Hegseth</a>, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This is going to require some explaining.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis‚Äîan Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is ‚ÄúGod is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam‚Äù‚Äîsoon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">This is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump‚Äôs national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn‚Äôt find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration‚Äôs contentious relationship with journalists‚Äîand Trump‚Äôs periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Two days later‚ÄîThursday‚Äîat 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A message to the group, from ‚ÄúMichael Waltz,‚Äù read as follows: ‚ÄúTeam ‚Äì establishing a principles [] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The message continued, ‚ÄúPls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The term  generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying‚Äîbut I‚Äôll say it anyway‚Äîthat I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">One minute later, a person identified only as ‚ÄúMAR‚Äù‚Äîthe secretary of state is <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/marco-rubio/\">Marco Antonio Rubio</a>‚Äîwrote, ‚ÄúMike Needham for State,‚Äù apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as ‚Äú<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/j-d-vance/\">JD Vance</a>‚Äù wrote, ‚ÄúAndy baker for VP.‚Äù One minute after that, ‚ÄúTG‚Äù (presumably <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/tulsi-gabbard/\">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, ‚ÄúJoe Kent for DNI.‚Äù Nine minutes later, ‚ÄúScott B‚Äù‚Äîapparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, ‚ÄúDan Katz for Treasury.‚Äù At 4:53 p.m., a user called ‚ÄúPete Hegseth‚Äù wrote, ‚ÄúDan Caldwell for DoD.‚Äù And at 6:34 p.m., ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù wrote ‚ÄúBrian McCormack for NSC.‚Äù One more person responded: ‚ÄúJohn Ratcliffe‚Äù wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump‚Äôs Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as ‚ÄúS M,‚Äù which I took to stand for <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/stephen-miller/\">Stephen Miller</a>. I appeared on my own screen only as ‚ÄúJG.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That was the end of the Thursday text chain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">After receiving the Waltz text related to the ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group,‚Äù I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of  in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The next day, things got even stranger.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, ‚ÄúMichael Waltz‚Äù texted the group: ‚ÄúTeam, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.‚Äù (, in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) ‚ÄúState and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled ‚ÄúJD Vance‚Äù responded at 8:16: ‚ÄúTeam, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.‚Äù (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, ‚Äú3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn‚Äôt understand this or why it‚Äôs necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump‚Äôs position on virtually any issue. ‚ÄúI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There‚Äôs a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A person identified in Signal as ‚ÄúJoe Kent‚Äù (Trump‚Äôs nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, ‚ÄúThere is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We‚Äôll have the exact same options in a month.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Then, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user ‚ÄúJohn Ratcliffe.‚Äù The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 8:27, a message arrived from the ‚ÄúPete Hegseth‚Äù account. ‚ÄúVP: I understand your concerns ‚Äì and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what ‚Äì nobody knows who the Houthis are ‚Äì which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed &amp; 2) Iran funded.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Hegseth message goes on to state, ‚ÄúWaiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first ‚Äì or Gaza cease fire falls apart ‚Äì and we don‚Äôt get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC‚Äù‚Äîoperations security. ‚ÄúI welcome other thoughts.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A few minutes later, the ‚ÄúMichael Waltz‚Äù account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president‚Äôs request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The account identified as ‚ÄúJD Vance‚Äù addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: ‚Äúif you think we should do it let‚Äôs go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.‚Äù (The administration has argued that America‚Äôs European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy‚Äôs protection of international shipping lanes.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: ‚ÄúVP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It‚Äôs PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At this point, the previously silent ‚ÄúS M‚Äù joined the conversation. ‚ÄúAs I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn‚Äôt remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">That message from ‚ÄúS M‚Äù‚Äîpresumably President Trump‚Äôs confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller‚Äîeffectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from ‚ÄúPete Hegseth,‚Äù who wrote at 9:46 a.m., ‚ÄúAgree.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">After reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">It was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">At 11:44 a.m., the account labeled ‚ÄúPete Hegseth‚Äù posted in Signal a ‚ÄúTEAM UPDATE.‚Äù I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command‚Äôs area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. ‚ÄúI will say a prayer for victory,‚Äù Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched . Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, ‚ÄúMichael Waltz‚Äù had provided the group an update. Again, I won‚Äôt quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an ‚Äúamazing job.‚Äù A few minutes later, ‚ÄúJohn Ratcliffe‚Äù wrote, ‚ÄúA good start.‚Äù Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including ‚ÄúMAR,‚Äù who wrote, ‚ÄúGood Job Pete and your team!!,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSusie Wiles,‚Äù who texted, ‚ÄúKudos to all ‚Äì most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.‚Äù ‚ÄúSteve Witkoff‚Äù responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. ‚ÄúTG‚Äù responded, ‚ÄúGreat work and effects!‚Äù The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">On Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC‚Äôs  and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration‚Äôs more hesitant approach. ‚ÄúThese were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth‚Äîwhat ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group‚Äôs creator, ‚ÄúMichael Waltz,‚Äù that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left‚Äîor, more to the point, who I was.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the ‚ÄúHouthi PC small group‚Äù a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Brian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. ‚ÄúThis appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,‚Äù Hughes wrote. ‚ÄúThe thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">William Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. ‚ÄúThe Vice President‚Äôs first priority is always making sure that the President‚Äôs advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration‚Äôs foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters‚Äînot for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I‚Äôve never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Conceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of ‚Äúnational defense‚Äù information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúnational defense‚Äù information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF‚Äîmost Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home‚Äîor communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped ‚Äútop secret‚Äù or not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">There was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">‚ÄúUnder the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,‚Äù Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">‚ÄúIntentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,‚Äù Baron said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist‚Äîpresumably by mistake‚Äîto his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">All along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group‚Äîwhich, at the time, included me‚Äî‚ÄúWe are currently clean on OPSEC.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><em>Shane Harris contributed reporting. </em></p>","contentLength":21591,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jivjuv/trump_administration_accidentally_leaks_war_plans/"},{"title":"Ukraine‚Äôs most dangerous city craves relief from killer drones | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYUGvy6gkI","date":1742835199,"author":"Reuters","guid":13346,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Ukrainian city of Kherson, continually targeted by Russian drone attacks, is seeking respite.

The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.</p><p>\"If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25% tariff to do business with the United States ‚Äîthat's on top of existing tariffs,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House. </p><p>Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.</p><p>\"This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,\" Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.</p><p> crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S.  crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87.</p><p>\"We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation,\" analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.</p></div><div><p>The U.S. was the second-largest destination for Venezuelan crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to Kpler. India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.</p><p>Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office. The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.</p></div><div><p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth lobbied Trump administration officials to extend the license during meetings last week, people familiar with the discussions told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/chevron-ceo-lobbies-for-more-time-to-wind-down-venezuela-operations-5afc2dee\" target=\"_blank\">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Chevron does business in Venezuela through a partnership with its national oil company Petr√≥leos de Venezuela. The oil major has stakes in five onshore and offshore projects in western and eastern Venezuela.</p><p>The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., people familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.</p><p>Trump invoked the 1798 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/invocation-of-the-alien-enemies-act-regarding-the-invasion-of-the-united-states-by-tren-de-aragua/\" target=\"_blank\">Alien Enemies Act</a> on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting \"irregular warfare\" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.</p><p>Federal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-obama-judge-deportations-venezuela.html\">has rebuked Trump's calls</a> for Boasberg to be removed.</p><p><strong>Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE</strong><p>Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!</p><p>Uncertain markets?

The Kyiv Post was unable to independently verify the video‚Äôs location or timing.</p><p>The report specifies that the Ka-52 is an attack helicopter used by Russia for reconnaissance and striking ground targets. In contrast, the Mi-8 transport helicopters are deployed to move personnel and cargo and support ground operations.</p><p>According to open sources, a Ka-52 helicopter costs approximately $16 million, and an Mi-8 around $8 million.</p><p>As reported by Kyiv Post, the Kamaz Ka-52 Alligator is widely regarded by military analysts as <a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/20317\">one of the world‚Äôs top attack helicopters</a>, thanks to its counter-rotating rotors, advanced targeting systems, heavy armor, and powerful weaponry.</p><p>Designed for a two-person crew, the Ka-52 is heavily promoted for its Vikhr attack missile, which Moscow claims can destroy a tank from a distance of 10 km. This allows Ka-52 gunners to hit targets beyond the range of many battlefield point-defense systems such as MANPADS.</p><p>According to Forbes, Ka-52 helicopters were likely responsible for some of Ukraine‚Äôs equipment losses during the 2023 counteroffensive, using their long-range missiles to engage targets while hovering over the battlefield.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/31249#articles-sub-title-2\">The Mi-8 (NATO designation: Hip)</a> is a versatile twin-engine helicopter developed by the Mil Design Bureau in the early 1960s.

The passenger version seats up to 18 people, while the transport variant features folding benches for up to 24 troops.</p><p>The Mi-8MT military transport modification is designed for troop deployment and evacuation, fire support, precision bombing, and cargo transport, making it a key asset for airborne operations.</p><p>As per the SSO, all helicopters were destroyed in an artillery missile strike on a concealed Russian jump pad - an improvised, camouflaged position used for rapid redeployment and surprise attacks against Ukraine‚Äôs Security and Defense Forces.</p><p>‚ÄúThe enemy once again believed it was safe deep in the rear.

Vi m√• derfor se alvoren i √∏jnene og erkende, at hver eneste minut g√¶lder for, at amerikanernes dr√∏m om at annektere vores land ikke bliver til realitet, og der har vi brug for et handlekraftigt og beslutningsdygtigt Naalakkersuisut, som kan tr√¶de til p√• vegne af befolkningen, p√•peger M√∫te Bourup Egede (IA).</p><h3>Hvor bliver vores allierede af?</h3><p>M√∫te Bourup Egede mener, at de demokratiske lande og is√¶r Gr√∏nlands allierede er alt for t√∏vende med at erkl√¶re og udvise deres st√∏tte til Gr√∏nland:</p><p>- Indtil for nyligt kunne vi trygt stole p√• amerikanerne, som jo var vores allierede og venner, og som vi yndede at arbejde t√¶t sammen med.

Men at vores √∏vrige allierede i det internationale samfund f√∏les at gemme sig i et lille hj√∏rne og n√¶rmest hvisker, at de st√∏tter os, har ingen effekt, og hvis de ikke h√∏jlydt siger fra overfor, hvordan USA behandler Gr√∏nland, vil situationen eskalere dag for dag, og den amerikanske aggression vil tiltage.

organisation's accounts.</p><p>A lack of response left the three nations frustrated, and they warned the US that they were looking at talking to media about their missing money.</p><p>\"It's a concern for us, especially as we want our partner organisations to be compensated for the work they have put into the programs,\" said Julia Lindholm, a spokesperson for the Swedish government's international development agency.</p><p>In the government-to-government emails, it was made clear that other foreign governments had also given money to USAID for distribution, according to an official directly familiar with the matter who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The US State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to questions asking how many foreign governments had money for joint development programs going unspent.</p><p>Nor did it comment on any contributions from allies that were yet to be refunded in the USAID funding freeze and how much money that totalled.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-08/judge-blocks-trump-usaid-freeze/104913794\" data-component=\"Link\"

Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the European Union and USAID.</p><p>The aim of the project is to help farmers and others in poorer countries develop innovative ways to grow more food without straining water supplies.</p><p>The US failure so far to disburse or refund allies' donations is harming \"6 million of the poorest and most vulnerable farmers in the world who are dependent on the technologies for their food production and food security\", Ms Lindholm added in an email sent to the Associated Press.</p><p>She called the WE4F program \"extraordinarily impactful\", with measurable benefits for farmers and others many times greater than the program's initial targets.</p><p>Sweden's development agency said it estimated it had $US12 million total, including $US5.1 million for WE4F, sitting in USAID accounts.</p><p>The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation confirmed it had not received information about the fate of a $US1.4 million contribution it made to WE4F since the USAID dissolving began.</p><p>And the Dutch Foreign Ministry said it reached out to the US aid agency to ask how much of the $US1.6 million it had given for WE4F was yet to be disbursed by USAID and should be refunded.</p><p>All three confirmed there had been no clarification from any representative from USAID or the US government.</p><p>The nations added that they were working with donor partners to explore \"other opportunities to continue to run the WE4F
