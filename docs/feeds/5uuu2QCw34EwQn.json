He wants solid support from allies.</p><p>Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.</p></div><div data-component=\"caption-block\"><figcaption>Watch: Key moments on Mark Carney’s journey from banker to Canada's PM</figcaption></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians – Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".</p><p>The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security – a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".</p><p>His itinerary is full of great symbolism too. </p><p>Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".</p><p>So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour – Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.</p><p>And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.</p><p>His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.</p><p>And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c878ryr04p8o\">who stepped down as prime minister</a> amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top. </p><p>But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.</p><p>His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.</p><p>Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.</p><p>\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.</p><p>Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.</p><p>Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors. </p><p>Many will be watching to see how Trump addresses Mark Carney - he recently referred to Canada's former prime minister as \"Governor Trudeau\".</p><p>Canada's new top talker has been talking tough. </p><p>A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"</p><p>But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.</p><p>And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.</p><p>On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.</p><p>\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"</p><p>Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.</p><p>On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister. </p><p>In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.</p><p>Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.</p><p>This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics – \"to do something and be seen to be doing it\".</p></div>","contentLength":6218,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jdhsdq/canadas_carney_makes_statement_by_choosing_europe/"},{"title":"Putin Responds to Trump's Plea to Spare Ukrainian Troops #war","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD0QfqkqjHA","date":1742230842,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":1023,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The latest on the war in Ukraine. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin demanded Ukraine to order troops who had occupied land in the Kursk region to surrender.

membership, while 29% were strongly or somewhat opposed, and 25% were unsure.</p><p>A significant driver is economic pressure from the U.S., particularly regarding tariffs and the ongoing trade dispute.</p><p>The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) already boosts Canada-EU trade — valued at $157.3 billion in 2023, according to international.gc.ca — and joining the EU could further secure access to a stable single market of 27 nations.</p><p>The Abacus findings align with growing discussions about Canada’s international alliances amid tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada.</p><p>According to Abacus, 24% of Canadians are open to the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S. This includes 6% who are absolutely in favour and 18% who are open to considering it, while 70% are absolutely against it.</p><p>Speaking at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is, \"the most European of non-European countries.\"</p><p>The Abacus results contrast with a recent Leger poll indicating 86% of Canadians expressed pride in their country, an

Speculation eased later as the White House said his administration is pursuing the complete denuclearization of North Korea.</p><p>Highlighting his hope to bring down the number of nuclear weapons in the world, Trump pointed out North Korea's sizable nuclear arsenal.</p><p>\"Kim Jong-un has a lot of nuclear weapons by the way ... a lot and others do also,\" he said. \"You have India.

This breakthrough could significantly impact battlefield conditions if sustained, particularly considering potential policy changes under the Trump administration.</p><div>Amid the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, Trump has alarmed European allies by appearing to shift toward Moscow after taking office in January. Russian glide bombs have caused numerous Ukrainian military and civilian casualties and played a decisive role in territorial gains by Kremlin forces, especially in 2024. However, their effectiveness appears to have diminished recently.</div><p>Russian military bloggers with connections to the air force reported earlier that Ukrainian forces have successfully disrupted the control systems of these weapons. Glide bombs function as conventional aerial munitions upgraded with metal wings and satellite navigation, which increases both their range and accuracy. Their lack of a motor means they produce no heat signature, making them difficult for conventional air defense systems to detect and intercept, Der Spiegel notes. During flight, they can be controlled via satellite.</p><h2>How Ukraine disrupts Russian bombs</h2><p>While precise details of Ukraine’s countermeasures remain limited, military expert Thomas Withington from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) explained to Der Spiegel that satellite jamming is a likely method.</p><blockquote><p>“<em>When a satellite signal reaches the earth, it is only very weak. If you generate a stronger signal at the same frequency near the receiver, it will mask the signal from space,</em>” Withington told Der Spiegel.</p></blockquote><p>This interference allows defenders to redirect the bomb onto a new trajectory. Russian forces reportedly complain they now require many more bombs and sorties to achieve successful strikes, making missions increasingly impractical.</p><p>Withington notes that countermeasures against such jamming do exist:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Western glide bombs, for example, use an encrypted GPS signal and therefore do not react to other signals</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Whether Russians lack this technology or Ukrainians have broken their encryption remains unclear. Russian forces generally use their own satellite navigation system called Glonass, but according to Withington, many frontline soldiers utilize simple, unencrypted receivers.</p><p>Consistently disrupting glide bombs would further weaken Russia’s stalled advances. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air capabilities are advancing with Western support, as American F-16s and French Mirages gradually arrive, and Ukraine has been using US- and French-supplied glide bombs.</p><p>However, Western equipment comes with limitations.</p><blockquote><p><em>“The Ukrainians have not received permission from the Americans to use the encrypted signal because the technology could fall into the hands of the Russians,”</em> Withington explained to Der Spiegel.</p></blockquote><p>With modern glide bombs and fighter jets, Ukraine could gain an advantage, though limited by their small numbers. In larger quantities, these weapons could severely impact Russian forces, but given uncertain US support, a significant increase in capability seems unlikely for now.</p><div><div><strong>You could close this page.

While he has threatened to impose <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/painful-for-russia-what-new-u-s-sanctions-on-russian-energy-mean-for-moscow/\">new sanctions</a> and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal are reached, he has blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the fighting and suspended <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/washingtons-cutoff-of-military-aid-could-be-resolved-rubio-says-ahead-of-talks-in-saudi-arabia/\">military aid</a> and <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/us-resumes-sharing-intelligence-with-ukraine-gabbard-confirms/\">intelligence</a>.</p><p>But Europe still has a chance to turn things around. Already, it is abandoning its post-Cold War “end of history” mindset, according to which international law reigned supreme, European militaries were for keeping peace, not fighting wars, and the U.S. could be counted on to safeguard Europe’s security.</p><p>Finland and Sweden were perhaps the first to realize that “history is back,” and their accession to NATO — in 2023 and 2024, respectively — provided a major boost to the Alliance’s northern flank. Now the European Union also appears to be coming to terms with its new security situation, having just announced an $840 billion <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/eu-introduces-rearm-europe-plan-to-boost-european-defense-capabilities/\">rearmament plan</a>. Even Germany, for which the return of history is particularly fraught, is preparing to rearm: incoming Chancellor <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/friedrich-merz/\">Friedrich Merz</a> and his likely coalition partners have agreed to create a 500 billion euro ($544 billion) infrastructure fund and loosen fiscal rules to allow for greater investment in defense.</p><p>The significance of this move should not be underestimated. Since the end of World War II, Germany has eschewed hard power in favor of the soft kind, serving as an engine of European integration and a bulwark of the rules-based world order. Beginning in the 1960s, this included the pursuit of “constructive engagement” — a foreign-policy approach known as Ostpolitik — with the Soviet Union and then Russia. This explains former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s embrace of Russian energy supplies, despite the objections of other EU members and the U.S.</p><p>Putin’s full-scale <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/war/\">invasion of Ukraine</a> drove a stake through the heart of Ostpolitik. Within days, Merkel’s successor, <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/olaf-scholz/\">Olaf Scholz</a>, announced an “epochal change” (\"Zeitenwende\") in Germany’s defense and foreign policy. But it is Merz who is set to oversee a true break from Germany’s postwar past — a change that will require the country to confront the most daunting, destructive ghosts of its history.</p><p>For starters, there is the fiscal revolution. Germany’s frugality has been a source of considerable tension in the EU, particularly during the eurozone debt crisis of the early 2010s. But Germans — not least Merkel — recalled all too well how hyperinflation had paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler, and in 2009 Merkel’s first government introduced a constitutional restriction on structural budget deficits to 0.35% of GDP annually, also known as the “debt brake” (\"Schuldenbremse\"). Against this backdrop, Merz’s planned overhaul of borrowing rules — including the modification and possible elimination of the debt brake — represents a radical change in Germany’s priorities.</p><p>More broadly, Merz appears prepared to embrace European leadership. Despite being the EU’s largest economy, <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/tag/germany/\">Germany</a> has long been reluctant to assume a genuine leadership role in Europe, particularly in the security domain. The combination of Russian revanchism and U.S. isolationism, however, has made this stance untenable. As Europe’s most populous country, situated in the continent’s “geostrategic center,” Merz says, Germany must “take greater responsibility for leadership” on defense.</p><p>To avoid a repeat of the Munich Agreement of 1938 — when France and Britain forced Czechoslovakia to cede territory to Hitler, setting the stage for World War II — Europe must step up quickly to improve Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and, thus, at the negotiating table. Fortunately, substituting lost U.S. financial aid will not be as difficult as Trump would have us believe: to date, Europe has provided far more support for Ukraine’s war effort in dollar terms than the U.S. has. Fulfilling the weapons gap would, however, be far more challenging and probably impossible in the all-important short term.</p><p>Once a peace agreement is reached, Europe will have to act as its guarantor — and that means delivering effective deterrence against Russian aggression. A credible nuclear umbrella is essential. That is why Merz has suggested replacing U.S. nuclear warheads in Europe with French and British alternatives. There is even talk of Germany becoming a nuclear power itself.</p><p>When NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in 1999, Germany’s then-chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, ruled that sending ground troops to fight in a country that had once been occupied by Hitler’s \"Wehrmacht\" was “unthinkable.” Today, as Merz seems to recognize, the unthinkable has become necessary. Only if Germany — and Europe as a whole — puts aside its moral and political inhibitions can it continue to perform its most important role: as a global force for peace and a defender of democratic principles.</p><p><em>Editor’s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.</em></p>","contentLength":5752,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jdej8g/germanys_military_rebirth_is_europes_best_bet/"},{"title":"Cubans buy potable water as pipes fail during energy crisis | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ybKgWZT64","date":1742223247,"author":"Reuters","guid":971,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Alternative sources to obtain drinking water are emerging in Havana with businesses selling purified or well water amid an energy crisis in Cuba.\n\n#News #Cuba #Power #Americas #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4iyLzyI\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":559,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/G2ybKgWZT64?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bloomberg Surveillance 03/17/2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBv29Oq5oOw","date":1742223239,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":978,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowicz and Annmarie Hordern speak daily with leaders and decision makers from Wall Street to Washington and beyond.

closed doors about reducing up to 40-50% of contracted staff, including IT specialists.\"</p><p>The job cuts have been drastic, especially in sectors previously considered safe. The military-industrial complex, already under pressure from the cost of war, has taken a significant hit as production targets stumble.</p><p>Meanwhile, private sector firms like internet behemoth VK, mobile operator, and energy giant Gazprom are all making cutbacks.</p><p>Anastasia Ovcharenko, a partner at Kontakt InterSearch Russia, cautioned: \"It's likely that IT specialists working on investment projects with uncertain prospects will be let go.</p><p>\"These projects will be closed and their resources redistributed, but there won't be a big story where all tech staff are fired.\"</p><p>The downturn is also hitting medium-sized companies hard, especially those saddled with hefty debts. These firms are crumbling under unmanageable borrowing costs, forcing many to cut back on their workforce to survive.</p><p>The human toll of conflict further intensifies the economic turmoil. Russia's military is suffering losses in its personnel and financial stability. With over 200,000 Russian soldiers estimated to be dead or injured as per the UK Ministry of Defense, Putin's push to reinforce his troops has involved drafting vast numbers of men, many of whom are dispatched to the battlefields of Ukraine. </p><p>The repercussions are being felt deeply by families and industries alike. Natalia Milchakova, a top analyst at Freedom Finance Global, remarked: \"We can't rule out that in some sectors unemployment might go up slightly, for example if small and medium-sized enterprises leave the market or considerably cut expenditure because they cannot access finance due to high interest rates.\"</p><p><b>For the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage </b></p><p>She also noted: \"But here, too, layoffs will mostly affect white-collar workers, not blue-collar staff, which practically every Russian industry needs.</p><p>\"This has resulted in an overall stagnation of wages. Despite government claims of minimal wage growth, experts concur that the situation is much more grim.Olga Shamber from Get experts, a recruitment firm, observed: \"The wage race will likely run out of steam this year. Salaries will rise, but not as fast as before.</p><p>\"Adding to the conversation, Anastasia Ovcharenko from Kontakt InterSearch Russia said: \"Business is caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, high interest rates and expensive loans.</p><p>\"She continued: \"On the other, this also affects the lives of employees. \"Highlighting the impact on workers, she explained: \"If previously they could get a mortgage at 10%, now they can only get one at 30%, and that means they will demand more money from their employers.</p><p>\"Analysts are sounding the alarm that the cumulative effects of the death toll, economic turmoil, and the escalating costs of the conflict could be driving Russia towards an economic meltdown.Oleg Buklemishev, a notable Russian economist and current Director of the Economic Policy Research Center at Moscow State University, has issued a stark warning: \"There is no longer enough of a profit margin to significantly increase workers' salaries.
