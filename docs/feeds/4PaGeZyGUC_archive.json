But there is as much, if not more, value in understanding existing code - particularly long-lived, large, and complex legacy systems.\n\nAt Thoughtworks we have been experimenting with using this technology with our clients, embodied in a tool called CodeConcise, which combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from the abstract syntax trees of a codebase. We have found this useful both to draw out low-level requirements and to build a high-level explanation of a system.\n\nThis talk will show what we have learned and how it could change the age old challenge of wrangling legacy at speed, iteratively and with zero downtime.

Hundreds of children of members of Islamic State (IS) are stuck in Syrian camps. Often, with no hope of returning to their home nations.\n\nAround 38,000 foreign nationals - more than 60 per cent of whom are children - are being held in Al-Hol and Roj, two closed, sprawling camps in north-eastern Syria that have been holding mostly spouses, other adult female relatives and children of male IS suspects since 2019. \nMost of the children are under 14 years old and many have spent most, if not all, of their lives in the camps. Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #children\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O‚ÄôReilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future ‚Äì and take Neil to task on his own predictions.\n\nThe conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon‚Äôs robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here ‚Äì and what did sci-fi get wrong?\n\nWe break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we‚Äôre headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. \n\nPlus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?\n\nLooking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry?

The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men‚Äôs claims. \n\nThe documentary picks up the story of the two men‚Äôs legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade‚Äôs and James‚Äôs civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. \n\nThe documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. \n\nMaterial for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.\n\nDirected by Dan Reed\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

This all sounds cool, until the oxygen runs out... \n\n#kurzgesagt\n#inanutshell #kurzgesagt_inanutshell #learnwithshorts #science #invertedearth #whatif \n\nSources &amp; further reading: \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/kgs-tiktok-sources\n\nFollow us for more sciencey content! ü¶Ü\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ‚ù§ https://shop.kgs.link/shorts\nBecome a Part of kurzgesagt by joining the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook</article>","contentLength":2327,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/joYJahY4FUI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"This is the most common way to get head lice - Nazzy Pakpour","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-EEp5xiF6Q","date":1741878037,"author":"TED-Ed","guid":132,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Dig into what makes head lice so difficult to get rid of, and the effectiveness of our most common treatments.\n\n--\n\nFor as long as humans have had lice, we‚Äôve fought hard to get rid of them.

They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \"fighting animals\" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n07:40 Who's \"Optimizing Cloud Native Java\" for?\n09:29 Performance tuning: Art &amp; science\n21:43 Java performance\n32:21 Concurrency in modern Java\n39:10 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans &amp; Jim Gough ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Cloud Native Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41nivD9\nBen Evans, Jason Clark &amp; David Flanagan ‚Ä¢ Java in a Nutshell ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43FDoMA\nBen Evans, Martijn Verburg &amp; Jason Clark ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41JMG7N\nBen Evans, Jim Gough &amp; Chris Newland ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh\nBen Evans &amp; Martijn Verburg ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk\nGoetz, Peierls, Bloch, Bowbeer, Holmes &amp; Lea ‚Ä¢ Java Concurrency in Practice ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4215zo6\nVenkat Subramaniam ‚Ä¢ Cruising Along with Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4dFuBwU\nMonica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PerformanceEngineering #JVM #JVMPerformanceEngineering #Observability #HardwareInnovation #Java #JavaProgramming #JavaPerformance #JavaConcurrency #Concurrency #CloudNative #CloudNativeJava #GraalVM #Quarkus #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #BenEvans #Kittylyst #HollyCummins #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n\n[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience.

Bring up the railguns, let‚Äôs finish this and go home.‚Äô - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015\n\nElectromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.\n\nThe lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.\n\nThis will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n‚öîWebsite: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n‚öîBlog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n‚öîFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n‚öîTwitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n‚öî Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick‚Äôs crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.\n\nIn this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn‚Äôt wear gold.\n\nThen, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe‚Äôs expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Hakeem Oluseyi\n03:30 - The Astronomical Society @astrosocietypac \n9:31 - IMAP\n14:32 - How Do We Resolve Hubble Tension?\n25:25 - Detecting Atmospheres of Distant Planets\n27:29 - Better Tools or Better Physics to Unlock Dark Matter\n32:41 - Can Gravitational Waves Alter Time? \n37:30 - What is the Conservation of Information?\n41:01 - The Big Squeeze\n41:36 - Get Those Dyson Spheres Out of Your Head\n44:38 - Closing Thoughts\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.\n\nThe young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin‚Äôs high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.\n\nJustin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.\n\nConor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he‚Äôs running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.\n\nDespite the government‚Äôs promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ireland  #housing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.‚Äù \n\nIt felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  \n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread.

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.

We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.\n\nFour women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan‚Äôs hard-won rights. \n\nThe team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #afghanistan #womenrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU‚Äôs border protection agency‚Äôs reputation. But now, it‚Äôs trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.\n\nThe message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? \n\nThe new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He‚Äôs said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frontex #humanrights #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nThe 1861 map of the US we use a few times in the piece is itself a strikingly rich document that I could stare at forever: https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701sm.gct00482/?sp=33\n\nSome other original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.\n\nWith this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.\n\nLearn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:\n‚Ä¢ The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between\n‚Ä¢ How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain\n‚Ä¢ The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture‚Äîand how to best interact with it\n‚Ä¢ How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code\n\n* Book description: ¬© O'Reilly:\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prompt-engineering-for/9781098153427\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:27 Key aspects of Prompt Engineering &amp; its definition\n08:22 Misconceptions about Prompt Engineering\n10:21 Practical applications &amp; tools\n13:43 5 principles of prompting\n26:27 Balancing creativity &amp; specificity in AI models\n32:42 RAG: The power of iterative steps, query planning &amp; routing in AI systems\n42:59 Understanding agentic systems: Beyond prompt-based AI\n51:56 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nJames Phoenix &amp; Mike Taylor ‚Ä¢ Prompt Engineering for Generative AI ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43cFDqO\nPhil Winder ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nKelleher &amp; Tierney ‚Ä¢ Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, G√∂rner &amp; Gillard ‚Ä¢ Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PromptEngineering #Prompting #GenerativeAI #RAG #RetrievalAugmentedGeneration #DAG #DirectAcyclicGraphs #ChatGPT #ReinforcementLearning #DSPyOptimizers #GenAI #AIUseCase #ArtificialIntelligence #ML #DataScience #JamesPhoenix #MikeTaylor #PhilWinder #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

This special forest is home to countless spruce and fir trees. One very special species towers above them all, giving many animals shelter: the giant arbor vitae, or ‚ÄòTree of Life‚Äô.\n\nThe proud giant, which can live for up to a thousand years, plays an important role in the mythology of the Nuxalk. These indigenous people communicate with their ancestors through the tree. But the tree of life also plays a key role in the ecosystem and is home to numerous species - from the smallest insects to stately mammals. The animals crawl into its trunk or find shelter under its bushy foliage. \n\nThe giant arbor vitae has watched over the Canadian rainforest and the adjacent ocean for thousands of years. Every fall, the salmon return to their native rivers in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest after spending several years at sea. They fight their way upstream to spawn - and provide a feast for the bears, who devour the delicious fish in the shade of the trees. \nNothing is lost in the forest. Scavengers feed on any remains left among the tree roots and whatever is left nourishes the rich forest soil with nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, even the salmon promote tree growth and contribute to a unique ecosystem. \n\nForest and ocean live in symbiosis here. When heavy rainfall erodes the soil, nutrients are transported through the rivers to the sea, where they benefit the humpback whales. Nowadays, however, this complex ecosystem is threatened by massive logging. Here, too, humans are jeopardizing a balance that has existed for thousands of years.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canada #environment #nature \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But what if we revisit the fundamentals? Embrace simplicity and speed using Vanilla JS, modern browser APIs, and different server architectures, including site generators.\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about embracing the simplicity and speed of development that comes with a ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô approach.\n\nThis session is all about exploring how to craft rich web apps and websites using nothing but the HTTP protocol, core JavaScript, and browser APIs‚Äîno dependencies, just pure power! If you have never created apps with Vanilla JS or without a library, now is the perfect time to understand it.\n\nWe‚Äôll journey through the modern landscape of JavaScript‚Äôs foundational features, which have evolved into a robust suite of tools. From Web Components to Shadow DOM, reactivity and declarative templates, PWA APIs, reactive programming, and client-side routing, we‚Äôll uncover how to harness these powerful features typically provided by libraries.\n\nWe‚Äôll also delve into server-side architectures and how to use static site generators for some websites and web apps.\n\nLet‚Äôs rediscover the potential of returning to the roots of web development and see what your code can do without libraries or frameworks!

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn‚Äôt have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.\n\nWe visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.\n\nFor those who couldn‚Äôt afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas‚Äîmulti-story buildings in Rome‚Äîrelied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.\n\nFish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.</article>","contentLength":2898,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/utTF7dXcxfQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neil & a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM","date":1741114490,"author":"StarTalk","guid":340,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nWe begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.\n\nFusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches‚Äîfrom Princeton‚Äôs tokamak designs to Livermore‚Äôs laser-driven experiments‚Äîand why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.\n\nBut fusion isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs?

The World Food Programme says nearly 25 million people are facing acute food shortages - all driven by a war that has received little international attention.\n\nAid organizations warn that the dimension of the crisis surpasses those in Ukraine, Gaza and Somalia combined. The conflict has been running since 2023, pitting army chief and de facto president Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan against his former deputy Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The fighting has displaced 12 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. Yet, the crisis is barely present in the international media. That‚Äôs partly because journalists are rarely given access to the war zone. But DW correspondent Mariel M√ºller managed to secure permission to film from the Sudanese army. Embedded with military forces, she traveled to the capital Khartoum, where the paramilitary RSF control swathes of territory and the battle for dominance continues to rage - leaving the civilian population trapped in the crossfire. And the conflict shows no signs of ending soon.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sudan #warzone \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Donald Trump and Joe Biden are even older and are now - the two oldest men to ever be inaugurated as president. \n\nThe average ages in the House and Senate at 58 and 64, are significantly older than the average American. A word often used to describe the nation‚Äôs governing class is ‚Äúgerontocracy‚Äù - meaning government based on rule by old people.\n\nIt's not just in the US either - around the world our political leaders are older than ever before.

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen.

Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists?

Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks ‚Ä¶. good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven‚Äôt always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 ‚Äî and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had ‚Ä¶ varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods ‚Äî but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere‚Äôs VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren‚Äôt going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It insists that human rights are at their ‚Äúhistorical best,‚Äù and that Tibetans‚Äô religious freedoms are being protected, but the footage and first-person accounts from exiled Tibetan interviewees in FRONTLINE‚Äôs ‚ÄúBattle for Tibet‚Äù paint a different picture.\n\nThe documentary investigates the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs rule over the tightly-controlled territory and the struggle over the survival of Tibetan language, culture and religion.\n\nThe film examines China‚Äôs branding of the Dalai Lama as an anti-China separatist, despite his repeated statements that he is no longer seeking Tibetan independence and would accept self-rule within China ‚Äî and explores China‚Äôs pursuit of a campaign to choose his successor. \n\nChina insists that life in Tibet is ‚Äúsignificantly better‚Äù for the people there because of its rule, which it says must continue. \n\n‚ÄúBattle for Tibet‚Äù is a Hardcash production with GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV. The director and producer is Gesbeen Mohammad. The senior producers are Dan Edge and Eamonn Matthews.
