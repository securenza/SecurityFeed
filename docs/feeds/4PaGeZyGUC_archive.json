But for years, the valuable humus layer has been thinning. Farmers in Brandenburg are clearly feeling the effects of this on their sandy fields. Many are now taking steps to prepare their farms for the future.\n\nYears of drought, record rainfall and failed harvests: we are becoming increasingly aware of how sensitively our environment reacts to extreme weather conditions. Farmers' livelihoods are at stake. So is the ability of consumers to afford food. \nFor a few years now, agriculture that focuses solely on maximum yields has been regarded with increasing skepticism. It is becoming more and more clear just how dependent we are on healthy soils.\nBrandenburg is the federal state with the worst soil quality in Germany. The already thin, fertile humus layer has been shrinking for decades. Researchers and farmers who are keen to experiment are combating these developments and looking for solutions. Priority is being given to building up the humus layer, which consists of microorganisms and fungi, as well as springtails, small worms and centipedes. \nFor Lena and Philipp Adler, two young vegetable farmers, the tiny soil creatures are invaluable helpers. On their three-hectare organic farm, they rely on simple, mechanical weed control, fallow areas where the soil can recover, and diversity. Conventional farmer Mark Dümichen also does everything he can to protect soil life on his land. For years, he has not tilled the soil after the harvest and sows directly into the field. His yields have stabilized since he began to work this way.\nIsabella Krause from Regionalwert AG Berlin-Brandenburg is convinced after the experiences of the last hot summers that new crops will thrive on Brandenburg's fields in the long term. She has founded a network of farmers who are promoting the cultivation of chickpeas with support from the scientific community. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #agriculture \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome’s port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.\n\nOne key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.\n\nPublic temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces.

Its canopy of leaves, almost 50 meters high, towers over the crowns of the forest. The tree shapes the myths of the indigenous Wayana people.\n\nWith over 80,000 plant species and hundreds of thousands of animal species, the Amazon rainforest is a green ocean of life. In the midst of this ecosystem, the kapok tree provides both shelter and crucial spaces for reproduction. Numerous animal species could not survive without the kapok tree. \nDragonflies and damselflies buzz around the spines on its trunk to lay their larvae in the bromeliad ‘air plants’ that grow on the tree. Here, the smallest influences the largest - and vice versa. Bromeliad plants do double duty, acting as floating water reservoirs: they store up to 50,000 liters of water per hectare of forest.\n\nWhen the forest floor is under water during the rainy season, the fish become gardeners. They feed on the seeds that have fallen from the trees and spread them all over the Amazon region. The kapok tree is firmly anchored in the ground with its huge roots until the next dry season. The whole forest breathes, from the moss on the ground to the treetops. This gas exchange makes life on earth possible. But dangers such as deforestation and climate change threaten this unique ecosystem.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #amazonrainforest #kapok  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could the collapse of the empire’s Old Kingdom provide any clues? [Originally aired in 2019]\n\nFollowing the long reign of Pepi II, a series of weak kings ruled ineffectively.

As the climate shifted all over the world, the country was then hit by a decades-long drought that caused a great famine and economic failure.\n\nGo behind the scenes with archaeologists and scientists as they venture through Africa – from the Pyramids to the glaciers of Mt.

Since the beginning of time, obtaining food has been one of the most important activities of mankind. Research using new methods for examining and analyzing human fossils reveals previously unknown facets of prehistoric man. The results demonstrate the central role that food plays in the anatomical, genetic and social evolution of humans.\nUntil the beginning of agriculture in the Neolithic period, the first humans fed on what nature provided for them. Their diet shaped their evolution and humanity as we know it today.\nThis two-part documentary invites you on a journey into the past and shows the complexity and diversity of prehistoric life based on scientific findings from around the world. Suzana Herculano-Houzel explains how the cooking of food influenced the mental performance of early humans. Delphine Vettese from the Natural History Museum in Paris shows how cutting techniques for mincing meat and scraping out bone marrow were passed down from generation to generation. João Zilhão and Ernestina Badal present the results of their research into prehistoric food remains.\nFrom archaeological sites in the Dordogne to Portugal, the USA and Jordan, the film shows spectacular images of caves, semi-caves and other prehistoric sites in nature.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #archaeology #food #ancestors #stoneage \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.\n\nNext, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.\n\n• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming\n• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses\n• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features\n• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes\n• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 Overview\n02:06 Kafka is the standard for operational data\n03:41 Iceberg for analytical data in data lakes\n04:42 Apache Iceberg\n05:27 Why Iceberg?\n12:24 Structure of an Iceberg table\n16:40 Streaming to data lakes is complicated\n20:47 Tableflow materialize Kafka topics as Iceberg tables\n23:47 Demo\n35:37 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotochgo.com/2024/sessions/3370\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Sriskandarajah Suhothayan • Design Patterns for Cloud Native Applications • https://amzn.to/3szGx0p\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Prabath Siriwardena • Microservices for the Enterprise • https://amzn.to/40FhxkQ\nKasun Indrasiri • Beginning WSO2 ESB • https://amzn.to/3sx9NF0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#ApacheKafka #Kafka #ApacheIceberg #Iceberg #AmazonAthena #DataStreaming #DataLake #DataWarehouse #ACIDTransactions #KafkaStreams #Confluent #Tableflow #ConfluentTableflow #KasunIndrasiri\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!\n\nShouldn’t the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What’s in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went “bang”? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. \n\nWhat can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe’s invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. \n\nAs the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.\n\nFinally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Charles Liu\n02:15 - Why Don’t Gas Clouds Disperse? \n10:01 - What Went “Bang”?\n22:56 - What Will We Learn From Gravitational Waves? \n31:15 - Do Particles Ever Touch? \n39:55 - Observing Early Generation Stars\n46:28 - Could Slowing Time Make You More Massive? \n49:57 - Closing\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.\n\nAfter two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichstätt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a \"mission donation.” High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.\n\nLawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops’ Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: \"People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.” Janssen regards such practices as \"a form of obstruction of justice”. No consideration at all was given to the victims. \n\nSo did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #catholic #church #germany #southamerica \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

From the Egyptians to the Romans, to the Chinese, oil lamps were common in the cities of ancient civilizations. The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. \n\nBut most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn’t only true for nocturnal creatures. We are also affected by exposure to artificial light and can develop serious conditions because of it, like sleep disorders, diabetes and even cancer. \n\nWatch the documentary on our channel.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #light #lightpollution #insects \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":1096,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/hYYw87lpn-A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From XP to TCR & Limbo • Kent Beck & Daniel Terhorst-North • GOTO 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48g7CRlMUD8","date":1739278805,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":122,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted\nhttps://gotopia.tech\n\nRead the full transcription of this interview here:\nhttps://gotopia.tech/articles/355\n\nKent Beck - Software Engineer &amp; Creator of Extreme Programming @KentLBeck \nDaniel Terhorst-North - Originator of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) &amp; Principal at Dan North &amp; Associates @daniel-terhorst-north \n\nRESOURCES\nKent\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/kentbeck.bsky.social\nhttps://www.kentbeck.com\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck\nhttps://twitter.com/KentBeck\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kentbeck\n\nDaniel\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/tastapod.com\nhttps://twitter.com/tastapod\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/danielterhorstnorth\nhttps://github.com/tastapod\nhttps://mastodon.social/@tastapod\nhttp://dannorth.net/blog\n\nLinks\nhttps://youtu.be/tgaKAF_eiOg\nhttps://youtu.be/k9lwn-RqEsE\nhttps://youtu.be/Saaz6D1azlU\nhttps://youtu.be/lOcXdXRxFgA\nhttps://youtu.be/klqo1oPdbpM\nhttps://youtu.be/ShAzlhS_TCg\nhttps://youtu.be/86-Dy5U2p5Y\nhttps://youtu.be/yuEbZYKgZas\nhttps://youtu.be/-4Ybn0Cz2oU\nhttps://youtu.be/XShcmCBK93E\n\nDESCRIPTION\nKent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development.

Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be? \n\n\nSupport our work.

Why is this happening?\n\nIn the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:49 Rome – Why are young people fans of fascism?\n02:50 Rome – At the HQ of Forza Nouva\n04:00 An expert’s take - Prof Hurrelmann\n04:42 Netherlands – A dinner party with right-populists\n07:00 Netherlands – How right-wing populists use social media\n08:41 Germany – Protests against Alternative of Germany\n09:20 Germany – Inside an AfD rally\n10:47 Simple answers to complex issues?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #politics #elections #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn &amp; Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.\n\nWe dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?\n\nWhat happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?\n\nWe also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Jon Alvarez, Peter Dyreng, Joseph Dolan, Chesterfield Browne, Vinkey, Raymot Holmes, Kev, Kamila Kaftol, Biko Duncan, Nathan Hill, Alex Mertz, Erik Berglund Photography, Tricia Lynch, Mathaniel Spomer, Micheal Palmer, John Keltonic, Jack Williams, Eric Christensen, Melissa Palladino, Chris Ormonde, Tom Somers, Ivynelsewhere, Rafael Arenas Jr, Maurice Bakker, Flamigo Toes, Cadu Magarinos Torres, Tanner Simon, and Mike Nagavalli for supporting us this week.\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\nIn doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.\nThe documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #jerusalem \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?\n\nFilmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. \n\nEmilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.\n\nIn this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. \n\nThe film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #holocaustsurvivor #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.\n\nFingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\n“Unveiling intra-person fingerprint similarity via deep contrastive learning,” by Gabe Guo et al. \nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi0329\n\n“The developmental basis of fingerprint pattern formation and variation,” by James D.

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.\n\nProfessor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein’s works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. \n\nSuzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. \n\nAnd there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world?

Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. \n\nIn Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. \n\nAnd biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. \n\nHowever, these practices are also attracting criticism.

[Originally aired in 2019]\n\nAfter four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.\n\nKing Arthur's Lost Kingdom | Secrets of the Dead\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year — a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.  \n\n01:03 Munich: Beautiful, but Expensive\n01:37 Hannelore Kiethe Offers Food Assistance\n05:20 Till Amelung Searches for an Apartment\n07:42 Christa Lippmann's Alternative Housing Project\n10:51 On the Road with Doctor Christoph Lohmann\n17:03 Abdullah Alyaqub Becoming a Train Driver\n19:01 Dietmar Kibbel Takes Action\n\n#DWstories #documentary #dwdocumentary #germany #dwstoriesBTW\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM’s new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.\n \nToday we’re going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it’s important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.\n\nPlan your visit to IWM's Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries: https://www.iwm.org.uk/events/blavatnik-art-film-and-photography-galleries\n\nFind out more about Gassed: https://www.iwm.org.uk/gassed-by-john-singer-sargent\n\nSee more British War Artist work: https://www.iwm.org.uk/learning/resources/british-art-of-the-first-world-war\n\nView high resolution scan of Gassed: https://highres.factumfoundation.xyz/Sargent_Gassed/shared/viewer.html\n\nAttributions:\nGassed scans by Factum Foundation for Imperial War Museums\nVirtual Hall of Remembrance created by immersive technology studio Infinite Form for IWM for the centenary of the armistice\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video from IWM Film:\nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/4149\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/I_W_M\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/imperialwarmuseums/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london</article>","contentLength":1592,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/f-oCv4ILyPg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Living on the Edge • Erica Pisani • GOTO 2024","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6c29Gtlpjs","date":1738760424,"author":"GOTO Conferences","guid":115,"unread":true,"content":"<article>This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo\nhttps://gotochgo.com\n\nErica Pisani - Senior Software Enginee at Float Financial @ericapisani2789 \n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/ericapisani.dev\nhttps://hachyderm.io/@ericapisani\nhttps://twitter.com/ericapisani\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/erica-pisani-5b77ab84\nhttps://github.com/ericapisani\nhttps://www.ericapisani.dev\n\nABSTRACT\nEdge computing is not a new concept but in the past few years we're seeing powerful tools made more easily available at the edge.\nThis talk will go into what the edge is, why its increasing availability and adoption is exciting, and ways we can start incorporating the edge into our applications.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.\n\nWe dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe’s deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?\n\nTo wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe’s vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.\n\nWith a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos—and everything in between.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Brian Cox\n04:10 - Rockstar Physicist\n07:28 - Being a Skeptic\n14:02 - The Frontier of Particle Physics\n18:54 - Making Higgs Particles\n22:34 - pursuing Elegance\n25:06 - How Do We Find New Particles? \n29:30 - Progress in String Theory\n41:30 - Giant Black Hole Jets\n47:08 - Celebrating the Universe\n52:00 - Life on Europa\n1:02:22 - Neutrinos\n1:12:26 - Closing\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he’s been working to educate people.\n\nUnlike many adults, younger people aren’t as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.\n\nWeinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg’s were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.\n\nHe finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he’s been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda Dänekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.\n\nThis film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #holocaustsurvivor \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For a thing we’ve been doing for years, ever since someone said “what if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?” It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.\n\nBut here’s a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It’s easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there’s a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren’t able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?\n\nI’ve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I’ve had successes, and I’ve had failures. I’ll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:\n\n• Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech\n• Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod\n• Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets\n\nAnd I’ll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.\n\nTakeaways\n• Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before\n• Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you’re using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away\n• Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you’re doing that, capture your leadership team’s expectations and track team commitments\n• Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you’re stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads\n• The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:36 What is platform engineering?\n05:37 No. 1: Power tools\n18:32 No. 2: Technology anarchy\n31:18 No. 3: Ticketing hell\n40:04 Takeaways\n42:24 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2024/sessions/3235\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSteve Smith • Measuring Continuous Delivery • https://leanpub.com/measuringcontinuousdelivery\nSteve Smith &amp; Denise Yu • A Children's A to Z of Continuous Delivery • https://leanpub.com/achildrensatozofcontinuousdelivery\nSteve Smith &amp; Matthew Skelton • Build Quality In • https://leanpub.com/buildqualityin\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PlatformEngineering #PlatformLeadership #Kubernetes #ApacheKafka #Istio #TechnologyAnarchy #CICD #SteveSmith\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nIn April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.\n\nWhile millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nBombing Auschwitz | Secrets of the Dead\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.\n\nIn response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. \n\nIn War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.\n\nUnder Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As \"scout cruisers of the air,\" airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.\n\nIn 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>","contentLength":3348,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/w6vgVTJK_rg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why Does Ice Float?

The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.\n\nLesson by Max G.

These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.\n\nOur speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!\n\nThis lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n⚔Website: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n⚔Blog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n⚔Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n⚔Twitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n⚔ Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.
