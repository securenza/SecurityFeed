He didn’t elaborate on what specific actions that would entail.</p><p>China and the U.S. have spent the past two weeks locked in an escalating trade war, with both sides piling on new tariffs and raising barriers to trade. Chinese imports to the U.S. now face tariffs of at least 145%, while American goods headed to China are being hit with a 125% rate — levels so high they’re likely to bring trade between the two largest economies to a near standstill.</p><p>The impact is expected to hit China hard. Its economy is already under pressure from deflation, sluggish consumer demand and a prolonged property slump. Economists have been downgrading their forecasts for China’s growth this year, with UBS Group AG the most pessimistic among major banks, predicting the economy will expand just 3.4% as U.S. tariffs choke exports. </p><p>Zhu said China has “full confidence” in meeting its growth target of around 5% this year, pointing out that it’s the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the country is on track to achieve the goals laid out in it.</p><p>He was also optimistic that domestic consumption will rise this year and said China has “full capacity” to ramp up spending if necessary.</p><p>Zhu served as deputy finance minister until his retirement in 2018, overseeing the Customs Tariff Department and playing a key role in U.S.-China trade negotiations. He was most recently a counselor to the State Council.</p><p>Chinese officials have repeatedly said they’re open to negotiations, but not under pressure or threats. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Trump expects talks “at some point,” though “we’re not there yet.” The president has said he’s waiting for China’s call and described Xi as a friend for whom he has “great respect,” highlighting his preference for negotiating leader-to-leader.</p><p>Zhu criticized the U.S. tariffs as being highly damaging to China’s national interests and said Beijing has a long-standing position of not giving in to external pressure. He added that coercion from Washington would be ineffective in resolving the dispute.</p><p>When asked if China might sell off its Treasury holdings in response to the tariffs, Zhu said the Chinese government is a “very responsible investor” that values global market stability. China, which owns about $700 billion in US debt, is the second-largest foreign creditor after Japan, raising concerns it could use those holdings as leverage.</p><p>“However, this is based on mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual cooperation,” Zhu said, referring to China’s stance on its Treasury holdings. “I really hope US and China can, based on mutual respect, return to negotiation.”</p>","contentLength":3257,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1jzsd9n/china_wont_talk_if_us_doesnt_show_respect/"},{"title":"Virginia Gov.

president of <a href=\"https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/\" target=\"_blank\">IST</a>, Rogério Colaço, told Lusa that he received the communication of the cancellation on the 5 March, of the programme called \"American Corners\" with \"immediate effect\", and, on the same day, an inquiry with \"quite inappropriate questions\" about whether IST collaborated or not, or was cited or not in accusations or investigations involving terrorist associations, cartels, human and drug trafficking, or organisations that promote mass immigration. </p><p>\"Técnico responded that it would not respond to the questionnaire because it was not appropriate for a public higher education institution to be subject to public and legal scrutiny in a democratic country that is a member of the European Union\", stated Rogério Colaço. </p><p>According to the president of IST, the communication of the cancellation of the programme, followed by a questionnaire, cites a determination issued by the US State Department. </p><p>In Portugal, \"American Corners\", financed by the US government and which the US Embassy in Lisbon describes as \"information and culture centers\", are six and all operate in university institutions.</p><p>In addition to IST, the universities of the Azores, Aveiro, Porto (Faculty of Arts), Lisbon (Faculty of Arts) and Nova de Lisboa (Faculty of Science and Technology) have these spaces. </p><p>At IST, \"American Corners\" had been operating for more than ten years and, according to Rogério Colaço, promoted lectures, meetings and \"dissemination as well as scientific activities\", whereby annual financing was around 20 thousand euros.</p><p>The director of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Lisbon (<a href=\"https://www.ulisboa.pt/en/unidade-organica/faculdade-de-belas-artes\" target=\"_blank\">FLUL</a>), Hermenegildo Fernandes, told Lusa that he received the same questionnaire, which left him astonished by the \"scale of the shamelessness\" of the questions, namely about \"climate agendas\", whether the institution had \"contacts with communist and socialist parties\" or \"relations with the United Nations, the People's Republic of China, Iran and Russia\" and what \"it did to protect women from gender ideologies\". </p><p>The faculty also chose not to respond to the questionnaire, noting that \"its dependence is on the scientific policies of Portugal and the European Union\", said the director of FLUL, without clarifying whether the \"American Corners\" programme was cancelled

The list grows longer if you look back. Even so, it’s still unusual for two of them to meet by chance in a restaurant. “How are you? Everything okay? I’ll call you one of these days,” Barnier says, seated at a table in a central Parisian restaurant, to fellow former prime minister François Fillon. “I lasted a little less than him,” he jokes in an interview with journalists from the European alliance Lena, which includes EL PAÍS.</p><p>Barnier — a former minister, European commissioner, but known above all as the famed EU chief negotiator <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/brexit/2021-05-17/the-dark-side-of-brexit-european-citizens-being-detained-in-migrant-holding-centers-in-uk.html\">of the Brexit agreement</a> — was also the oldest politician to occupy the Hôtel Matignon, official residence of France’s prime minister. He holds the record for being the occupant who lasted the shortest amount of time there. He also has enough irony to accept this fact and calmly reflect on the causes that led to it, closely linked to a certain <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-03-16/the-middle-class-turns-out-the-lights-in-france.html\">end of an era</a> in French politics. His downfall was the result of the chaos sown by President Emmanuel Macron after the dissolution of Parliament in June 2024. But it was also because the political left, he notes, failed to accept that it lacked a majority. Today, from a calmer perspective yet without concealing his ambition to become president of the Republic if he has enough support, Barnier reflects on the trade war with the United States and the EU’s new rapprochement with the United Kingdom following the divorce he himself helped to certify.</p><p>Why do you think <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-04-13/hurricane-trump-grabs-the-spotlight.html\">Trump’s America</a> is taking such a hostile stance toward the EU?</p><p> Trump is surrounded by billionaires and speculators who don’t like Europe because we are a union of 450 million people based on principles of regulation, governance and stability. We have an independent central bank, rules, banking supervision, and control mechanisms. Trump would like to make separate deals with each country, to divide and conquer. On the other hand, [Vladimir] Putin doesn’t like us either. He knows that the EU is a force of democratic attraction.</p><p>You believe that the response to the international crisis must be European. Why?</p><p> These days, we must learn how to adapt, to react quickly, but above all, to defend our interests in an unstable world. The first lesson of our time is that we must be European. I have always been patriotic—I admit it—but also deeply European. It is precisely in times of crisis that the need to react together is truly felt. If anyone today is looking for a reason to be European, it is there: in our collective capacity to face challenges. To do so, we must rely on our greatest asset, whether we are French, Polish, German, Italian, or Spanish.</p><p>What is that common asset?</p><p> The single market. During the Brexit negotiations, I firmly defended it, even against those who wanted, as they say in Germany, to “dance at two weddings at once”: to take advantage of the benefits without accepting the obligations. But the single market is immutable. It’s not just a free trade area; it’s much more. It’s an ecosystem with common rules, standards, shared regulations, coordinated oversight, and a common jurisdiction. It’s what gives us strength in global economic competition. And in a world of trade wars and geopolitical instability, it’s our greatest asset.</p><p> You insist on the need for unity. Is it really possible today?</p><p>European unity doesn’t just fall from the sky. As a Brexit negotiator, I can say that it’s cultivated. It requires constant political effort. And it’s that unity that brings us respect, even in the face of powers like the U.S., China and Russia. I’m convinced that Donald Trump will end up respecting Europe. For now, he respects almost no one, judging by his words and methods. But they will respect us because we are the single market, the largest and wealthiest in the world. And you only enter it by respecting its rules.</p><p>How can we defend European interests?</p><p> Methodically. European unity isn’t decreed, it’s built as we did during Brexit. It would require a clearly identified figure who speaks on behalf of the three EU institutions—the Commission, the Council and Parliament—who is accountable to everyone and takes the time to explain and convince.</p><p>Should we be prepared to adopt more trade sanctions against the U.S.?</p><p> Yes, we must prepare. There is, for example, the European Anti-Coercion Instrument, which would allow us to temporarily close our market to certain American products. It’s an extreme measure, but it must remain on the table. We mustn‘t announce it too soon, but we must prepare it seriously. We must avoid hasty or disorderly responses. Don’t give in too quickly. And above all, don’t be fazed.</p><p> I’m clear on one point: there was embezzlement. Four and a half million euros were stolen, and there must be sanctions. There’s no room for debate about that. And I recommend not questioning the independence of the judiciary. However, the general framework can be questioned: the law provides that a disqualification ruling can be enforced before all appeals have been exhausted. This is an important institutional issue that deserves serious debate in Parliament, and not fast-tracked to resolve a particular candidate’s situation.</p><p>Should this provision be reviewed?</p><p> Perhaps. Not for Le Pen, but for the future. I’m against circumstantial laws. But is it fair that a defendant, whoever they may be, can be hit with a disqualification sentence before the end of the proceedings?</p><p>What are the main lessons you have learned from your time at Matignon?</p><p> First, the fragmentation of the parties: today there is no longer a stable majority, as there was during the Fourth Republic, but there is also no spirit of compromise. The Socialist Party (PS) refused any discussion from the start. They told me: “We’ll vote for the motion of no confidence because you’re not left-wing.” Second lesson: how difficult it is to reactivate the state in France when it has come to a standstill.</p><p>Don’t you have the feeling that the Fifth Republic is exhausted, with a president who has lost some of his power?</p><p> No, I don’t think the Fifth Republic is dead. It works, but we need to return to its original spirit: a president who presides and a government that governs.</p><p>What were the reasons for your short-lived tenure?</p><p> There was no majority. I knew I could fall at any moment. That’s why I didn’t move to Matignon with my wife. I was cautious. The Socialist Party had no real reason to censure me, except for its commitment to <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-12-09/frances-leftist-leader-melenchon-macron-cannot-endure-30-months-of-appointing-governments-every-three-months.html\">[La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc] Mélenchon</a>: to vote against any prime minister who wasn’t “left-wing.” It was an ideological position.</p><p>Wasn’t that a mistake on President Macron’s part? Should he have appointed someone from the left?</p><p> He should have tried a coalition with the Republicans (LR) much earlier. He appointed me at the last minute, against the ropes.</p><p>Is there a real rapprochement between the EU and the UK?</p><p> There are signs of that, and it’s as much in their interest as it is in ours. I’ve always considered Brexit a grave mistake, contrary to the British national interest. I don’t know of any other nation, in peacetime, that decided to abandon the single market and the customs union. They could have left the EU and stayed in the single market, like Norway. But they quit everything, solely for ideological reasons and political rhetoric. And today they are paying the price.</p><p>What specific areas of cooperation do you see with London today?</p><p> At least five or six: European security, the fight against terrorism, defense organization and financing, foreign policy, cooperation in Africa. To this I add two more with an economic dimension: energy and artificial intelligence.</p><p> Could the UK then participate in the major European investment plans, especially in defense?</p><p> Of course. Several companies are already Franco-British or Euro-British. It’s in our interest to cooperate in armament, industrial capacities and research. The United Kingdom already participates in certain European research programs. And I think that, given the Ukrainian crisis and the new U.S. attitude, it’s time to organize this cooperation politically.</p><p> I propose the creation of a European Security Council. An intergovernmental body, outside the European Union’s institutions, that would include the United Kingdom and, for example, Norway. This Council would coordinate our common security and defense policy. It could bring together countries that so wish, starting with those that contribute the most to the European budget: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain.</p><p>Is U.K. reintegration a medium-term option?</p><p>It’s their decision. The door remains open. They can return to the customs union, to the single market, or even to full membership in the European Union. But they know the conditions. The further they move away from European rules in time and form, the harder it will be to return. Because you don’t return to the Union without accepting its rules.</p><p>Do you want to play a role in the future presidential campaign?</p><p> I’m not going to tell you I don’t have the ambition. When you’ve been prime minister, you’re always ready to serve.</p><p>You can’t build a European coalition with extremes. In some countries, there may be local, temporary alliances, but at the European level, it would be a strategic and moral error. The values of the EPP are not compatible with those of Vox or the National Rally. A self-respecting right cannot ally itself with those who deny the rule of law, reject Europe, or sympathize with [Vladimir] Putin. This isn’t a tactical debate; it’s a question of political identity.</p>","contentLength":9851,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jzkiox/exfrench_pm_michel_barnier_trump_would_like_to/"},{"title":"Trump Tariffs: Can the US and the EU Strike a Trade Deal?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC1Z51eJpnM","date":1744696296,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":23138,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maros Sefcovic, met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday.

Xi’s visit, marked by a 21-cannon salute, comes as China positions itself as a stable trade partner amid what it calls \"erratic U.S. policy\" under President Donald Trump. </p><p>The U.S. recently imposed — and then paused — sweeping tariffs on countries including Vietnam, its top export partner. Xi urged Vietnam to uphold global supply chain stability and resist trade pressure. Meanwhile, Trump dismissed the talks, telling reporters: “I don’t blame China. I don’t blame Vietnam. They are trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America,” adding that the European Union “was formed to hurt the United States on trade.” Xi’s trip marks his first overseas visit of the year, aimed at countering U.S. influence.

Normally during a chaotic trading situation, anxious financiers run to what has long been the safest of investments: dollars and dollar assets, like U.S. government debt. That drives the value of the dollar up and the interest rate on debt down.</p><p>Instead, we are <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-third-worlding-of-america\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Link opens in new window (seeing the opposite)\">seeing the opposite</a>: The dollar is falling against other currencies, and interest rates on American debt are increasing. As yet, these movements are relatively modest, and may represent nothing more than chaos in the market. However, they do indicate a likely weakening of confidence in the stability and security of the dollar as a global reserve currency—which given Trump’s deranged behavior, ought to be expected. A country that elected a senile criminal madman  is not to be trusted.</p><p>Wit that the European Union just might have a once-in-a-century opportunity to provide that stability and security to governments and investors, and swipe some or all of the dollar’s status. But it won’t happen automatically, and it will require permanently ditching the traditional European allergy to debt and printing money.</p><p>A reserve currency, of course, is one that is used to settle international transactions. Today, the dollar makes up about <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dollar-worlds-reserve-currency\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Link opens in new window (60 percent)\">60 percent</a> of foreign currency reserves; the euro about 20 percent. For years now, various people have predicted the collapse of the dollar, upset by the American addiction to cutting taxes on the rich and the resulting government borrowing. But in fact, this is one reason why the dollar is so useful, and a reason why nothing has replaced it. In order for a currency to be used internationally, it—or assets based on it—must be available in large quantities. Massive borrowing means trillions of dollar assets available around the world in the form of U.S. government bonds.</p><p>That is why until now the American government could borrow cheaply despite its enormous debt. But as Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein explain in their book , this “exorbitant privilege” comes at a heavy cost. Structurally high demand for the dollar pushes up its value relative to other currencies, making American exports less competitive. This was a major factor, in addition to the low wages in the nations to which U.S. corporations offshored their production, behind American deindustrialization in the late 20th century. American elites compounded this problem with the neoliberal vogue for “structural adjustment” programs pushed on developing countries suffering currency crises. American-backed agencies like the IMF and the World Bank would sweep in and demand austerity in exchange for a bailout, causing those countries to accumulate massive dollar hoards to protect themselves—pushing up the exchange rate further.</p><blockquote><p>The vast, probably multitrillion-euro EU rearmament and reinvestment effort currently under way could be financed essentially for free.</p></blockquote><p>Running a reserve currency also comes with responsibilities. During the 2008 financial crisis, and again during the COVID pandemic, the Federal Reserve let central banks in Germany, France, Switzerland, the U.K., Japan, and other nations use its “<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_liquidityswaps.htm\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Link opens in new window (swap line)\">swap line</a>” facilities, through which they could exchange their currencies for dollars—essentially granting them access to the dollar printing press, at a modest price. Close U.S. allies could thereby rely on the dollar, knowing that if a general crisis struck, the Fed would serve as a global lender of last resort, and stave off a general currency crisis.</p><p>All that may sound like displacing the dollar is a bad move. Actually, it would come with many benefits, and there are strategies the EU could use if it steps up to position the euro as the reserve currency that could help it avoid damaging its own industrial base. Besides, if the dollar does fall,  has to replace it, and better the EU than anyone else.</p><p>How to go about it? Silvia Merler <a href=\"https://www.bruegel.org/first-glance/more-eu-debt-issuance-would-be-best-response-trumps-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Link opens in new window (outlines the basic idea)\">outlines the basic idea</a> at Bruegel (an economic think tank based in Belgium). The key strategy would be to issue a lot of EU bonds; rather than individual member countries borrowing, the debt would be backed by the union as a whole. Then, rather than spending the money on tax cuts for the rich as America has done, plow it into the ongoing <a href=\"https://prospect.org/world/2025-04-02-germany-finally-gets-over-austerity/\">EU military buildup</a>.</p><p>Indeed, the EU has already issued such bonds during the pandemic to the tune of €600 billion, with another €150 billion as part of an EU rearmament program, and demand is high. “On a weighted average, EU bond issuance has been 8.3-times oversubscribed since 2020, and yields remain lower than those paid by most EU members—signaling a structurally strong demand for EU debt,” Merler writes. They would be even more attractive if they were based on some kind of fiscal union (not just the monetary union that currently exists), which could begin with a small tax paid by all countries into a central pot. But a third of the pandemic-era bonds are set to expire soon, more than offsetting the new debt. To replace dollars, many, many more euro-based assets—likely into the trillions—will be needed.</p><p>This might even be a wise step for European self-protection. Should a global financial crisis develop, leading to a panicked stampede for anything that seems safe, people will likely buy up any euro cash or euro-based asset they can find, driving its value through the roof.</p><p>Additionally, the European Central Bank would be wise to set up its own swap lines, and make them formal and explicit rather than opaque and ad hoc like those at the Fed. This would alleviate anxiety among eligible nations so they don’t have to build up defensive euro hoards and push up the currency’s value, damaging EU exporters.</p><p>There would be stiff political obstacles to accomplishing this, of course. Europeans, especially Germans, are <a href=\"https://prospect.org/world/2025-04-02-germany-finally-gets-over-austerity/\">historically allergic</a> to borrowing and printing money, much less fiscal union. (That’s one reason why European democracies failed to implement recovery measures like those of the New Deal in the 1930s.) But the potential benefits could be . The vast, probably multitrillion-euro EU rearmament and reinvestment effort currently under way could be financed essentially for free, and the EU would take its rightful place as the leader of the free world.</p><p>It took many years for the dollar to get where it is. During the 19th century, the British pound sterling was the reserve currency, and it took the American economy growing far larger than Britain’s, plus two shattering world wars, for the dollar to displace it. Now, Donald Trump may well be doing the work of a century of economic upheaval and Hitlerian destruction in a matter of weeks. But America’s catastrophic self-inflicted loss may be Europe’s gain.</p>","contentLength":6825,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jz7c6h/how_the_euro_can_replace_the_dollar/"},{"title":"El Salvador's Bukele says he can't return wrongly deported man to US | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwPbZvYt5Vs","date":1744657508,"author":"Reuters","guid":22998,"unread":true,"content":"<article>El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said he had no plans to return a man mistakenly deported from the United States as he met with President Donald Trump at the White House.\n\n#trump #immigration #deportation #elsalvador #News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://rb.gy/je7nkm\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":605,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/HwPbZvYt5Vs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"\"In a democracy, the police is the guardian of order.

Denmark recorded one of the sharpest drops, which could be linked to Trump’s widely criticized proposal for the US to take ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory.</p><p>Travel from Ireland, Germany, and Norway saw even more dramatic drops—each plummeting by more than 20%, according to ITA figures cited by the .</p><h3>Worst Decline Since Pandemic-Era Chaos</h3><p>In total, overseas travel to the US dropped by 12% last month compared to March 2024 figures, marking the sharpest monthly decline since 2021. That year, the global travel industry was still reeling from pandemic-related restrictions. Experts now suggest the current downturn stems directly from Trump’s political and economic stance.</p><h3>Experts Point to “Reputation Damage”</h3><p>“In just two months [Trump] has destroyed the reputation of the US, shown one way by diminished travel from the EU to the US,” said Paul English, co-founder of travel website Kayak. “This is not only one more terrible blow to the US economy, it also represents reputation damage that could take generations to repair.”</p><p>Adam Sacks, president at Tourism Economics, added: “It’s very clear something is happening . . . and it is a reaction to Trump.” He pointed to data from US airports and land crossings from Canada as evidence of the shift.</p><h3>Airlines and Hotels Feel the Impact</h3><p>Transatlantic routes, long considered among the most profitable for airlines, are now feeling the squeeze. Virgin Atlantic warned of a “modest” slowdown in demand last week, while Air France-KLM’s CEO Ben Smith said the airline had slashed economy-class transatlantic fares due to a “slight softness” in the market.</p><p>Sébastien Bazin, chief executive of French hotel group Accor, blamed border detentions for generating a “bad buzz” around travel to the US. He told  that European bookings for US destinations had dropped 25% this summer.</p><h3>Personal Stories Reflect Growing Concern</h3><p>Gloria Sync, an artist from England, canceled her trip to San Francisco scheduled for May after hearing reports of detained tourists. “The borders seem unsafe,” said Sync, who is transgender. “I don’t know if I’ll ever go back, to be honest,” she added, citing concerns about “unwanted attention” at the border.</p><p>Paul Harrington, a British retiree living in Paris, also scrapped his upcoming trip to Washington DC. “I am now contacting my US friends to visit me in Paris,” he said. “I will not visit the States until Trump is gone.” Harrington pointed to Trump’s tariffs and the dismantling of the US foreign aid agency USAID as reasons for his decision.</p><h3>Canadians Also Staying Away</h3><p>It’s not just Europeans. Visits from Canada have also declined, with travel analysts tying the trend to Trump’s divisive approach. “These are all unforced errors, and they have a significant effect on sentiment towards the US, and therefore travel,” Sacks said.</p><p>As travel demand sours, especially on once-thriving transatlantic routes, the ripple effects could hit US airlines, hotels, and local economies hard. The steep drop in European travel presents a serious warning to a sector already grappling with post-pandemic recovery—and the numbers suggest the damage may not be easily reversed.</p>","contentLength":3793,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jz28x7/trumps_rhetoric_blamed_for_sharp_drop_in_european/"},{"title":"Hungary passes a constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ public events","url":"https://apnews.com/article/hungary-pride-ban-amendment-orban-gay-rights-lgbtq-155ec12cbbde7cc6be0f96adb323de77","date":1744645354,"author":"/u/Throwsims3","guid":23273,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jz20so/hungary_passes_a_constitutional_amendment_to_ban/"},{"title":"LIVE: Prayer service near White House for Kilmar Abrego Garcia","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSXxL3e6Uvo","date":1744644814,"author":"Reuters","guid":22950,"unread":true,"content":"<article>People gather for a prayer service for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as US President Donald Trump prepares to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a leader praised by the administration for opening his country's prison system to alleged gang members and detainees Trump wants out of the United States.

They’ll just be under a different regime. It’s shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.”</p></div><div><p>On the other hand, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump’s tariff exemption on imported electronics is only temporary.</p></div><div><p>According to Lutnick in a Sunday <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/commerce-secretary-lutnick-tariff-exemptions-electronics-temporary/story?id=120752319\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"link\" data-vars-item-name=\"interview\" data-vars-item-type=\"text\" data-vars-unit-name=\"67fbf396e4b06646ea60b482\" data-vars-unit-type=\"buzz_body\" data-vars-target-content-id=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/commerce-secretary-lutnick-tariff-exemptions-electronics-temporary/story?id=120752319\" data-vars-target-content-type=\"url\" data-vars-type=\"web_external_link\" data-vars-subunit-name=\"article_body\" data-vars-subunit-type=\"component\" data-vars-position-in-subunit=\"3\">interview</a> on “This Week” with Jonathan Karl, electronics will be included in semiconductor tariffs, which will likely be enforced within a month or two. </p></div><div><p>Trump, Greer and Lutnick’s remarks on Sunday come in direct contrast with communication from U.S. Customs and Border Protection late on Friday <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"link\" data-vars-item-name=\"that claimed\" data-vars-item-type=\"text\" data-vars-unit-name=\"67fbf396e4b06646ea60b482\" data-vars-unit-type=\"buzz_body\" data-vars-target-content-id=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55\" data-vars-target-content-type=\"url\" data-vars-type=\"web_external_link\" data-vars-subunit-name=\"article_body\" data-vars-subunit-type=\"component\" data-vars-position-in-subunit=\"4\">that claimed</a> imported electronics, such as smartphones, laptops and more, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/tech/trump-electronics-china-tariffs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"link\" data-vars-item-name=\"would be exempt\" data-vars-item-type=\"text\" data-vars-unit-name=\"67fbf396e4b06646ea60b482\" data-vars-unit-type=\"buzz_body\" data-vars-target-content-id=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/tech/trump-electronics-china-tariffs/index.html\" data-vars-target-content-type=\"url\" data-vars-type=\"web_external_link\" data-vars-subunit-name=\"article_body\" data-vars-subunit-type=\"component\" data-vars-position-in-subunit=\"5\">would be exempt</a> from Trump’s tariffs.</p></div><div><p>“We can’t be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need,” Lutnick added. “So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption.

Alison Hicks, an associate professor in library and information studies at UCL, interviewed 10 UK-based school librarians who had experienced book challenges. One “spoke of finding propaganda from one of these groups left on her desk”, while another “was directly targeted by one of these groups”. Respondents “also spoke of being trolled by US pressure groups on social media, for example when responding to free book giveaways”.</p><p>It is “certainly possible that the scale of censorship we’re seeing in the US will influence the debate over here”, said Jewell. However, the level of influence to date is far from clear, particularly because the nature of censorship requests in the UK seems to differ from those brought forward in the US.</p><p>Censorship by pupils in UK schools, including “vandalising library material, annotating library books with racist and homophobic slurs”, and damaging posters and displays was identified in Hicks’ study, which she wrote about in the spring issue of the SLA’s journal, The School Librarian. Such censorship “is not something I have seen in the US”, she said.</p><p>The types of books targeted may also differ. “Almost all the UK attacks reported in my study centred on LGBTQ+ materials, while US attacks appear to target material related to race, ethnicity and social justice as well as LGBTQ+ issues,” said Hicks.</p><p>While the study was small, the “LGBTQ focus of book challenges was undeniable”, wrote Hicks. Challenges were levelled against Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper series, about the love story of two British schoolboys, and “coded” narratives in books such as Billy’s Bravery by Tom Percival, about a boy who wants to dress up as his favourite superhero, Nature Girl.</p><p>This supports the findings of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/19/uk-school-librarians-asked-remove-lgbtq-books-index-on-censorship\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Index on Censorship survey</a> last year, in which 28 of 53 librarians polled reported that they had been asked to remove books from library shelves, many of which were LGBTQ+ titles. In more than half of those cases, books were taken off shelves.</p><p>However, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/20/third-of-uk-librarians-asked-to-censor-or-remove-books-research-reveals\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">2023 study by Cilip</a>, which found that a third of UK librarians had been asked by members of the public to censor or remove books, did identify themes of race and empire as among the most targeted, along with LGBTQ+.</p><p>While there may be differences in how the challenges are playing out, “this should not take away from the huge impact these attacks are having” in the UK, said Hicks. “My research demonstrates that UK school librarians are facing equivalent levels of distress and hostility in the face of book ban challenges such as these.”</p><p>In the US, book banning measures have been enacted across a number of states in recent years. “Library leaders in the UK are paying close attention to what’s happening in the US and there’s definitely a strong feeling of solidarity with American librarians,” said Jewell. Coiffait-Gunn of Cilip added that the profession “looks on with deep concern at the increasingly polarised and political debate” in the US about “what people, especially children, are allowed to read”.</p><p>One cause for concern in the UK is the “lack of robust evidence” about how widespread censorship is, said Coiffait-Gunn. “It’s hard to evidence what doesn’t happen and which books are not available.” The government does not tally how many school libraries or librarians there are, “let alone track book bans”.</p><p>Most UK libraries follow the Cilip ethical framework, which states that published materials should not be restricted on any grounds but the law, said Jewell. “That gives them the confidence and assurance to reject demands” for censorship.</p><p>“What we must guard against is a climate where libraries avoid stocking certain books – or holding talks or activities – for fear of negative publicity, threats or intimidation,” he added. “It’s vital that libraries feel able to provide access to a wide range of perspectives if they are to facilitate the free exchange of ideas.”</p>","contentLength":5201,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jyt929/librarians_in_uk_increasingly_asked_to_remove/"},{"title":"Tech stocks lift Asian markets, but confusion reigns over US tariffs | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfayc08Oo1U","date":1744616327,"author":"Reuters","guid":22793,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Shares in Asian tech companies that are major suppliers to companies like Apple rose after the US government granted temporary exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China \n#News #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/42aMgsB\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en</article>","contentLength":628,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/zfayc08Oo1U?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gold Is a Go-To Haven for Dollar-Haters: 3-Minute MLIV","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Z3oAc1xnU","date":1744615968,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":22789,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta and Paul Dobson break down today's key themes for analysts and investors on \"Bloomberg: The Opening Trade.\"\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

Nearly three months into his second term, that clearly hasn’t happened. By March, as the scale of the challenge dawned on them, the tune coming from his administration quietly changed: meeting with delegations from Moscow and Kyiv in the Middle East, Trump’s representatives declared they were optimistic that a truce now could materialise in “weeks”.</p><p>The White House was reportedly aiming to get a peace deal signed by Easter. For Trump, a vain man with a weak spot for pomp and ceremony, the symbolism of such an achievement would be very neat indeed – and perhaps, he may have hoped, bring the Nobel peace prize he dreams of that little bit closer. This year, the celebration of Easter coincides in both the Western and Orthodox Christian church calendars; Easter Sunday will also mark exactly three months since Trump returned to the White House. Ending the war between Russia and Ukraine in this way would clearly have been a major win for the President.</p><p>But, with less than a week to go, we already know Trump’s ambition for an Easter peace deal was little more than wishful thinking.</p><p>Russia has just launched a new spring offensive in the north of Ukraine, amassing over 67,000 troops in their efforts to take over the city of Sumy. Over the weekend at least 31 people were killed in Russian missile strikes on the city. Vladimir Putin has shown few signs that he is willing to end the fighting or budge on his maximalist conditions for agreeing to a truce: namely that Ukraine be demilitarised and banned from joining Nato, and that the Ukrainian territories occupied by his troops are legally recognised as Russian. Ukraine has repeatedly said it will never accept such terms as part of a ceasefire with Moscow.</p><p>Despite claiming to have secured Russia’s agreement to a 30-day partial ceasefire on energy infrastructure in March (which Ukraine accused them of breaking almost immediately), the reality is that Trump is no closer to forcing Putin to the negotiating table. On Friday, the President’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/04/12/trump-envoy-steve-witkoff-bit-off-more-could-chew/\">returned from a meeting with Putin</a> in St Petersburg with seemingly little to show for it.</p><p>While Witkoff’s meeting was ongoing, Trump took to Truth Social to tell Russia to “get moving” on a deal. Speaking on Air Force One on Saturday, the President revealed that he thought discussions were going “fine”, although “there’s a point at which you just have to either put up or shut up”.</p><p>It’s clear that Trump is becoming frustrated with Russia stalling talks. It is also becoming increasingly clear that Trump seems more concerned with sealing any deal at all with Putin, than with what the specific contents of that deal may be or the consequences it holds for Ukraine.</p><p>Worse, over the weekend Keith Kellogg, Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/04/11/ukraine-divide-berlin-russia-second-world-war/\">suggested that as part of a peace deal</a>, the country could be carved up “almost like Berlin after World War Two”. Britain and France – but crucially not the US – could control the west of the country in order to enforce the ceasefire, he suggested, while Ukraine would be handed its own zone and Russia given control over the country’s eastern territories. An 18-mile wide demilitarised zone would keep Moscow and Kyiv’s troops apart.</p><p>What Kellogg didn’t say out loud was that such a plan to partition Ukraine would by default mean accepting Putin’s demand to recognise Russian sovereignty over the four regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. He is just the latest in a line of those close to Trump publicly conceding to the Russian President’s demands: in February US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/14/what-nato-membership-would-look-ukraine-trump/\">said it was “unrealistic”</a> to think Ukraine would be joining Nato. Tellingly, Witkoff also reportedly told Trump last week that the fastest way to end the war in Ukraine would be to hand these four territories to Putin.</p><p>Are these carrots that Trump’s team are hoping to dangle in front of Putin to lure him to the negotiating table? If so, they are unlikely to work: showing your best negotiating cards before discussions have even begun is unlikely to win you any concessions from your opponent. For a man who prides himself on supposedly perfecting the “art of the deal”, this is a bizarre misstep by Trump.</p><p>Far from enticing Putin to sign on the dotted line of a ceasefire deal, Trump’s top team are more likely to push the Russian President into seeing what more he can squeeze out of them. The conflict in Ukraine is currently still going in Putin’s favour; he – not Ukraine, and certainly not America – is in the position of strength.</p><p>Without doubt Trump does still hold some cards: he is reportedly thinking of imposing sanctions on Russia’s shadow fleet of illegal oil tankers – crucial to funding Putin’s invasion over the past three years – if no ceasefire comes before the end of the month. But if it means pushing Putin further away from the negotiating table, will he dare? I’m not so sure.</p>","contentLength":5141,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jyg8dt/trump_isnt_ending_the_war_in_ukraine_hes/"}],"tags":["news"]}
