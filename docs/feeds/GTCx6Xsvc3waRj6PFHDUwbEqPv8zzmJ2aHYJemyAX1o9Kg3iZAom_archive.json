An internal Treasury report <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/treasury-hackers-focused-on-sanctions-intelligence-report-says\">obtained by Bloomberg News</a> found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stole more than 3,000 files in that intrusion.</p><p>The indictments highlight how, in some cases, the hackers operated with a surprising degree of autonomy, even choosing targets on their own before selling stolen information to Chinese government clients. The indictment against Yin Kecheng, who was previously sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January for his involvement in the Treasury breach, quotes from his communications with a colleague in which he notes his personal preference for hacking American targets and how he’s seeking to ‘break into a big target,’ which he hoped would allow him to make enough money to buy a car.</p>","contentLength":1574,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Thousands of WordPress Websites Infected with Malware","url":"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/03/thousands-of-wordpress-websites-infected-with-malware.html","date":1741604477,"author":"Bruce Schneier","guid":654,"unread":true,"content":"<blockquote><p>Creating four backdoors facilitates the attackers having multiple points of re-entry should one be detected and removed.
