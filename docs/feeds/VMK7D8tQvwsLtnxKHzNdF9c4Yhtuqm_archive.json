It stores reams of potentially sensitive data, from confidential information about employees who want to form unions to proprietary business information.</p><p>The DOGE employees, who are effectively led by White House adviser and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, appeared to have their sights set on accessing the NLRB's internal systems. They've said their unit's overall mission is to review agency data for compliance with the new administration's policies and to cut costs and maximize efficiency.</p><p>But according to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with Congress and other federal overseers that was obtained by NPR, subsequent interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. It's possible that the data included sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets — data that four labor law experts tell NPR should almost never leave the NLRB and that has nothing to do with making the government more efficient or cutting spending.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                White House senior adviser Elon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One with President Trump on March 9.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><p>The employees grew concerned that the NLRB's confidential data could be exposed, particularly after they started detecting suspicious log-in attempts from an IP address in Russia, according to the disclosure. Eventually, the disclosure continued, the IT department launched a formal review of what it deemed a serious, ongoing security breach or potentially illegal removal of personally identifiable information. The whistleblower believes that the suspicious activity warrants further investigation by agencies with more resources, like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or the FBI.</p><p>The labor law experts interviewed by NPR fear that if the data gets out, it could be abused, including by private companies with cases before the agency that might get insights into damaging testimony, union leadership, legal strategies and internal data on competitors — Musk's SpaceX among them. It could also intimidate whistleblowers who might speak up about unfair labor practices, and it could sow distrust in the NLRB's independence, they said.</p><p>The new revelations about DOGE's activities at the labor agency come from a whistleblower in the IT department of the NLRB, who disclosed his concerns to Congress and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in a detailed report that was then provided to NPR. Meanwhile, his attempts to raise concerns internally within the NLRB preceded someone \"physically taping a threatening note\" to his door that included sensitive personal information and overhead photos of him walking his dog that appeared to be taken with a drone, according to a cover letter attached to his disclosure filed by his attorney, Andrew Bakaj of the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid.</p><p>The whistleblower's account is corroborated by internal documentation and was reviewed by 11 technical experts across other government agencies and the private sector. In total, NPR spoke to over 30 sources across the government, the private sector, the labor movement, cybersecurity and law enforcement who spoke to their own concerns about how DOGE and the Trump administration might be handling sensitive data, and the implications for its exposure. Much of the following account comes from the whistleblower's official disclosure and interviews with NPR.</p><p>\"I can't attest to what their end goal was or what they're doing with the data,\" said the whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, in an interview with NPR. \"But I can tell you that the bits of the puzzle that I can quantify are scary. ... This is a very bad picture we're looking at.\"</p><p>Tim Bearese, the NLRB's acting press secretary, denied that the agency granted DOGE access to its systems and said DOGE had not requested access to the agency's systems. Bearese said the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but \"determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.\"</p><p>Notwithstanding the NLRB's denial, the whistleblower's disclosure to Congress and other federal overseers includes forensic data and records of conversations with colleagues that provide evidence of DOGE's access and activities. Meanwhile, NPR's extensive reporting makes clear that DOGE's access to data is a widespread concern. Across the government, 11 sources directly familiar with internal operations in federal agencies and in Congress told NPR that they share Berulis' concerns, and some have seen other evidence that DOGE is exfiltrating sensitive data for unknown reasons.</p><p>A representative of DOGE did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p><h3>Taking apart computers to protecting government data</h3><p>Instead of a brand-new car for a 16th-birthday present, Berulis got his first computer.</p><p>It's a familiar story for tech nerds the world over: He methodically took the machine apart \"to figure out how it works,\" just like he had dissected radios from the thrift store years earlier. \"I electrocuted myself once,\" he recalled.</p><p>Berulis was always interested in public service, but the traditional paths didn't suit him.</p><p>A knee injury prevented him from joining the military. He served as a volunteer firefighter for a period and donated his time working for a local rape crisis hotline, answering calls from victims in need of someone to listen. But, he told NPR, \"I had an interest in serving my country.\"</p><p>Berulis had been a technical consultant for many years, including in auditing and modernizing corporate systems, when a job opened up at the National Labor Relations Board.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Daniel Berulis started working at the National Labor Relations Board about six months before President Trump started his second term.\n                </p></div></div></div></div><p>While he didn't know much about the agency, Berulisquickly found its mission to protect employees' rights in line with his long-standing desire \"to help people.\"</p><p>He started about six months before President Trump was inaugurated for his second term this past January. Berulis said he hit the ground running, securing the NLRB's cloud-based data servers and reinforcing what's called \"zero trust\" principles, which means that users can get access only to the parts of the system they need in order to do their jobs — no more, no less. That way, if an attacker gets hold of a single username and password, the attacker can't access the whole system.</p><p>\"When I first started, it was a dream come true,\" he said. \"There was a great opportunity to build up and do some good.\" But after the inauguration, he described a \"culture of fear\" descending over the agency.</p><p>The first week of March, engineers associated with DOGE arrived at the NLRB's headquarters, according to Berulis' disclosure. Beforehand, they had asked about what software, hardware, programming languages and applications the NLRB was using. DOGE learned that it used commercially available cloud infrastructure that businesses typically use, which connects to government cloud systems at other agencies and can be accessed remotely.</p><p>Berulis said he and several colleagues saw a black SUV and police escort enter the garage, after which building security let the DOGE staffers in. They interacted with a small number of staffers, never introducing themselves to most of the IT team.</p><p>Berulis says he was told by colleagues that DOGE employees demanded the highest level of access, what are called \"tenant owner level\" accounts inside the independent agency's computer systems, with essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to Berulis' disclosure.</p><p>When an IT staffer suggested a streamlined process to activate those accounts in a way that would let their activities be tracked, in accordance with NLRB security policies, the IT staffers were told to stay out of DOGE's way, the disclosure continues.</p><p>For cybersecurity professionals, a failure to log activity is a cardinal sin and contradicts best practices as recommended by the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\" target=\"_blank\">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as the FBI and the National Security Agency.</p><p>\"That was a huge red flag,\" said Berulis. \"That's something that you just don't do. It violates every core concept of security and best practice.\"</p><p>Those forensic digital records are important for record-keeping requirements and they allow for troubleshooting, but they also allow experts to investigate potential breaches, sometimes even tracing the attacker's path back to the vulnerability that let them inside a network. The records can also help experts see what data might have been removed. Basic logs would likely not be enough to demonstrate the extent of a bad actor's activities, but it would be a start. There's no reason for any legitimate user to turn off logging or other security tools, cybersecurity experts say.</p><p>\"None of this is normal,\" said Jake Braun, the executive director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and former acting principal deputy national cyber director at the White House, in an interview with NPR about the whistleblower's disclosure. \"This type of activity is why the government buys insider-threat-monitoring technology. So we can know things like this are happening and stop sensitive data exfiltration before it happens,\" he told NPR.</p><p>However, the NLRB's budget hasn't had the money to pay for tools like that for years, Berulis said.</p><h3>A backdoor to government systems?</h3><p>A couple of days after DOGE arrived, Berulis saw something else that alarmed him while browsing the internet over the weekend.</p><p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and DOGE engineer Jordan Wick had been sharing information about coding projects he was working on to his public account with GitHub, a website that allows developers to create, store and collaborate on code.</p><p>After journalist Roger Sollenberger started <a href=\"https://x.com/SollenbergerRC/status/1895609294810464390\" target=\"_blank\">posting on X</a> about the account, Berulis noticed something Wick was working on: a project, or repository, titled \"NxGenBdoorExtract.\"</p><p>Wick made it private before Berulis could investigate further, he told NPR. But to Berulis, the title itself was revealing.</p><p>\"So when I saw this tool, I immediately panicked, just for lack of a better term,\" he said. \"I kind of had a conniption and said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'\" He immediately alerted his whole team.</p><p>While NPR was unable to recover the code for that project, the name itself suggests that Wick could have been designing a backdoor, or \"Bdoor,\" to extract files from the NLRB's internal case management system, known as NxGen, according to several cybersecurity experts who reviewed Berulis' conclusions.</p><p>Wick did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                A screenshot of DOGE engineer Jordan Wick's public GitHub account that shows \"NxGenBdoorExtract.\" The name itself suggests that Wick could have been designing a backdoor, or \"Bdoor,\" to extract files from the NLRB's internal case management system.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Daniel Berulis/Annotation by NPR\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><p>\"It definitely seems rather odd to name it that,\" said one of the engineers who built NxGen and asked for anonymity so as not to jeopardize their ability to work with the government again. \"Or brazen, if you're not worried about consequences.\"</p><p>\"The whole idea of removing logging and [getting] tenant-level access is the most disturbing part to me,\" the engineer said.</p><p>NxGen is an <a href=\"https://www.governmentattic.org/57docs/NLRBnxGenCMSreplace2024-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">internal system</a> that was designed specifically for the NLRB in-house, according to several of the engineers who created the tool and who all spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation or adverse consequences for any future government work.</p><p>The engineers explained that while many of the NLRB's records are eventually made public, the NxGen case management system hosts proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony in ongoing cases. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act.</p><p>Those engineers were also concerned by DOGE staffers' insistence that their activities not be logged, allowing them to probe the NLRB's systems and discover information about potential security flaws or vulnerabilities without being detected.</p><p>\"If he didn't know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it's a nation-state attack from China or Russia,\" said Braun, the former White House cyber official.</p><h3>Putting the puzzle pieces together</h3><p>About a week after arriving, the DOGE engineers had left the NLRB and deleted their accounts, according to Berulis' disclosure to Congress.</p><p>In the office, Berulis had had limited visibility into what the DOGE team was up to in real time.</p><p>That's partly because, he said, the NLRB isn't advanced when it comes to detecting insider threats or potentially malicious actors inside the agency itself. \"We as an agency have not evolved to account for those,\" he explained. \"We were looking for [bad actors] outside,\" he said.</p><p>But he counted on DOGE leaving at least a few traces of its activity behind, puzzle pieces he could assemble to try to put together a picture of what happened — details he included in his official disclosure.</p><p>Then, DOGE engineers installed what's called a \"container,\" a kind of opaque virtual computer that can run programs on a machine without revealing its activities to the rest of the network. On its own, that wouldn't be suspicious, though it did allow the engineers to work invisibly and left no trace of its activities once it was removed.</p><p>Then, Berulis started tracking sensitive data leaving the places it's meant to live, according to his official disclosure. First, he saw a chunk of data exiting the NxGen case management system's \"nucleus,\" inside the NLRB system, Berulis explained. Then, he saw a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the network itself.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                This screenshot shows a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the NLRB system.\n                </p></div></div></div></div><p>From what he could see, the data leaving, almost all text files, added up to around 10 gigabytes — or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them, he explained. It's a sizable chunk of the total data in the NLRB system, though the agency itself hosts over 10 terabytes in historical data. It's unclear which files were copied and removed or whether they were consolidated and compressed, which could mean even more data was exfiltrated. It's also possible that DOGE ran queries looking for specific files in the NLRB's system and took only what it was looking for, according to the disclosure.</p><p>Regardless, that kind of spike is extremely unusual, Berulis explained, because data almost never directly leaves from the NLRB's databases. In his disclosure, Berulis shared a screenshot tracking data entering and exiting the system, and there's only one noticeable spike of data going out. He also confirmed that no one at the NLRB had been saving backup files that week or migrating data for any projects.</p><p>Even when external parties like lawyers or overseers like the inspector general are granted guest accounts on the system, it's only to view the files relevant to their case or investigation, explained labor law experts who worked with or at the NLRB, in interviews with NPR.</p><p>\"None of that confidential and deliberative information should ever leave the agency,\" said Richard Griffin, who was the NLRB general counsel from 2013 to 2017, in an interview with NPR.</p><h3>\"We are under assault right now\"</h3><p>For cybersecurity experts, that spike in data leaving the system is a key indicator of a breach, Berulis explained.</p><p>\"We are under assault right now,\" he remembered thinking.</p><p>When Berulis asked his IT colleagues whether they knew why the data was exfiltrated or whether anyone else had been using containers to run code on the system in recent weeks, no one knew anything about it or the other unusual activities on the network, according to his disclosure. In fact, when they looked into the spike, they found that logs that were used to monitor outbound traffic from the system were absent. Some actions taken on the network, including data exfiltration, had no attribution — except to a \"deleted account,\" he continued. \"Nobody knows who deleted the logs or how they could have gone missing,\" Berulissaid.</p><p>The IT team met to discuss insider threats — namely, the DOGE engineers, whose activities it had little insight into or control over. \"We had no idea what they did,\" he explained. Those conversations are reflected in his official disclosure.</p><p>They eventually launched a formal breach investigation, according to the disclosure, and prepared a request for assistance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). However, those efforts were disrupted without an explanation, Berulis said. That was deeply troubling to Berulis, who felt he needed help to try to get to the bottom of what happened and determine what new vulnerabilities might be exploited as a result.</p><p>In the days after Berulis and his colleagues prepared a request for CISA's help investigating the breach, Berulis found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure. It's unclear who sent it, but the letter made specific reference to his decision to report the breach. Law enforcement is investigating the letter.</p><p>\"If the underlying disclosure wasn't concerning enough, the targeted, physical intimidation and surveillance of my client is. If this is happening to Mr. Berulis, it is likely happening to others and brings our nation more in line with authoritarian regimes than with open and free democracies,\" wrote Bakaj, his attorney, in a statement sent to NPR. \"It is time for everyone – and Congress in particular – to acknowledge the facts and stop our democracy, freedom, and liberties from slipping away, something that will take generations to repair.\"</p><p>In part because of the stymied internal investigation and the attempts to silence him, Berulis decided to come forward publicly.</p><p>In fact, despite all that, Berulis managed to uncover some stranger and more troubling details about what happened while DOGE was logged on, which he enumerated in his official declaration.</p><p>Unknown users also gave themselves a high-level access key, what's called a SAS token, meaning \"shared access signature,\" to access storage accounts, before deleting it. Berulis said there was no way to track what they did with it.</p><p>Someone had disabled controls that would prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings. There was an interface exposed to the public internet, potentially allowing malicious actors access to the NLRB's systems. Internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off. Multifactor authentication was disabled. And Berulis noticed that an unknown user had exported a \"user roster,\" a file with contact information for outside lawyers who have worked with the NLRB.</p><p>Berulis said he noticed five PowerShell downloads on the system, a task automation program that would allow engineers to run automated commands. There were several code libraries that got his attention — tools that he said appeared to be designed to automate and mask data exfiltration. There was a tool to generate a seemingly endless number of IP addresses called \"requests-ip-rotator,\" and a commonly used automation tool for web developers called \"browserless\" — both repositories starred or favorited by Wick, the DOGE engineer, according to an archive of his GitHub account reviewed by NPR.</p><p>While investigating the data taken from the agency, Berulis tried to determine its ultimate destination. But whoever had exfiltrated it had disguised its destination too, according to the disclosure.</p><p>DOGE staffers had permission to access the system, but removing data is another matter.</p><p>Berulis says someone appeared to be doing something called DNS tunneling to prevent the data exfiltration from being detected. He came to that conclusion, outlined in his disclosure, after he saw a traffic spike in DNS requests parallel to the data being exfiltrated, a spike 1,000 times the normal number of requests.</p><p>When someone uses this kind of technique, they set up a domain name that pings the target system with questions or queries. But they configure the compromised server so that it answers those DNS queries by sending out packets of data, allowing the attacker to steal information that has been broken down into smaller chunks.</p><p>\"We've seen Russian threat actors do things like this on U.S. government systems,\" said one threat intelligence researcher who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly by their employer. That analyst, who has extensive experience hunting nation-state-sponsored hackers, reviewed the whistleblower's technical claims.</p><p>\"The difference is, they were given the keys to the front door,\" the researcher continued. While the researcher clarified that it would be difficult to fully verify what happened without full access to the NLRB system, they said Berulis' conclusions and accompanying evidence were a cause for concern. \"None of this is standard,\" they said.</p><p>Russ Handorf, who served in the FBI for a decade in various cybersecurity roles, also reviewed Berulis' extensive technical forensic records and analysis and spoke to NPR about his conclusions.</p><p>\"All of this is alarming,\" he said. \"If this was a publicly traded company, I would have to report this [breach] to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timeline of events demonstrates a lack of respect for the institution and for the sensitivity of the data that was exfiltrated. There is no reason to increase the security risk profile by disabling security controls and exposing them, less guarded, to the internet. They didn't exercise the more prudent standard practice of copying the data to encrypted and local media for escort.\"</p><p>\"Until there's an investigation done, there's no way to definitively prove who did it,\" Handorf concluded.</p><h3>\"No reason whatsoever for accessing the information\"</h3><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                The National Labor Relations Board seal hangs inside a hearing room at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., in 2019.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><p>DOGE's intentions with regard to the NLRB data remain unclear. Many of the systems that DOGE embedded itself in across the rest of the government <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/08/nx-s1-5321323/trump-doge-gsa-federal-buildings\" target=\"_blank\">have payment or employment data</a>, information that it could use to evaluate which grants and programs to halt and whom to fire.</p><p>But the case management system is very different.</p><p>It houses information about ongoing contested labor cases, lists of union activists, internal case notes, personal information from Social Security numbers to home addresses, proprietary corporate data and more information that never gets published openly.</p><p>Experts interviewed by NPR acknowledge that there are inefficiencies across government that warrant further review, but they say they don't see a single legitimate reason that DOGE staffers would need to remove the data from the case management system to resolve those problems.</p><p>\"There is no reason whatsoever for accessing the information. Now, could any agency be more efficient? More effective? Positively. But what you need for that is people who understand what the agency does. That is not by mining data, putting algorithms in and creating a breach of security,\" said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in labor and information technology.</p><p>\"There is nothing that I can see about what DOGE is doing that follows any of the standard procedures for how you do an audit that has integrity and that's meaningful and will actually produce results that serve the normal auditing function, which is to look for fraud, waste and abuse,\" said Sharon Block, the executive director of Harvard Law School's Center for Labor and a Just Economy and a former NLRB board member.</p><p>\"The mismatch between what they're doing and the established, professional way to do what they say they're doing ... that just kind of gives away the store, that they are not actually about finding more efficient ways for the government to operate,\" Block said.</p><p>For labor law experts, the mere possibility that sensitive records were copied is a serious danger that could create a chilling effect for employees everywhere who turn to the National Labor Relations Board for protection.</p><p>\"Just saying that they have access to the data is intimidating,\" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor education research at Cornell University and co-director of the Worker Empowerment Research Network. \"People are going to go, 'I'm not going to testify before the board because, you know, my employer might get access.'\"</p><p>Bronfenbrenner, the child of immigrant parents who fled the Soviet Union and Nazi-controlled Germany, said she spends a lot of time thinking about how systems can crumble under the right circumstances. \"You know, there's this belief that we have these checks and balances … but anyone who's part of the labor movement should know that's not true,\" she told NPR.</p><p>With access to the data, it would make it easier for companies to fire employees for union organizing or keep blacklists of organizers — illegal activities under federal labor laws enforced by the NLRB. But \"people get fired in this country all the time for the lawful act of trying to organize a union,\" said Block.</p><p>Having a copy of the opposing counsel's notes as companies prepare for legal challenges would also be an attractive possibility, she continued.</p><p>It's not just employees who might suffer if this data got out. Companies also sometimes provide detailed statements on internal business planning and corporate structure in the midst of unfair-labor-practice complaint proceedings. If a company was attempting to fire someone who it alleged had disclosed trade secrets and was fighting an unfair-labor-practice complaint based around that decision, those trade secrets might come up in the board's investigation too. That information would be valuable to competitors, regulators and others.</p><p>Overall, the potential exposure of the NLRB's data could have serious implications.</p><p>\"I think it is very concerning,\" said Shaiken. \"It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves,\" he said.</p><p>\"It is bringing a wrecking ball into the dentist office, meaning this is wildly disproportionate and raises real dangers,\" Shaiken continued.</p><h3>A conflict of interest and the dangers of exposure</h3><p>Labor law experts were particularly concerned about what they described as clear conflicts of interest, particularly when it comes to Elon Musk, his companies and his vast network of former employees and allies who are now getting access to government jobs and data.</p><p>Trump and Musk, during an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity, said Musk would recuse himself from anything involving his companies. \"I haven't asked the president for anything ever,\" <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/02/interview-of-president-trump-and-elon-musk-by-sean-hannity-the-sean-hannity-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Musk said</a>. \"I'm getting a sort of a daily proctology exam here. You know, it's not like I'll be getting away [with] something in the dead of night.\" However, DOGE has been granted high-level access to a lot of data that could benefit Musk, and there has been no evidence of a firewall preventing misuse of that data.</p><p>There are multiple ongoing cases involving Musk and the NLRB. For one, after a group of former SpaceX employees lodged a complaint with the NLRB, lawyers representing SpaceX, some of whom were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/27/nx-s1-5341559/lawyer-represented-musk-spacex-downsize-federal-contractors-watchdog\" target=\"_blank\">recently hired into government jobs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/11/18/nx-s1-5192918/spacex-amazon-nlrb-labor-board-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">filed suit against the NLRB.</a> They argued that the agency's structure is unconstitutional.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Elon Musk speaks with then-President-elect Donald Trump and guests at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div></div><p>Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. <a href=\"https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-presses-labor-secretary-nominee-on-protecting-sensitive-data-and-the-nlrb-from-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\">raised his concerns </a>about Musk accessing sensitive labor investigation data on cases against his companies or competitors during the confirmation hearing for Trump's labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in mid-February. He pressed her to answer whether she believed the NLRB is constitutional and to commit to keeping sensitive data confidential. While she said she was committed to \"privacy\" and said she respects the NLRB's \"authority,\" she insisted that Trump \"has the executive power to exercise it as he sees fit.\"</p><p>All this is happening in the context of a broader attempt by the White House to hamstring labor agencies.</p><p>The NLRB was created \"to guarantee workers' rights to organize and to address problems that workers have in the workplace,\" said Shaiken, of UC Berkeley. Under President Joe Biden, he recalled, the labor movement enjoyed an unusual amount of support from Washington. \"But what we have seen is a sharp slamming of the brakes to that and putting the vehicle in reverse in terms of what Trump has done so far,\" he continued.</p><p>In addition to sending DOGE to the NLRB, the Trump administration tried to neutralize the board's power to enforce labor law by removing its member Gwynne Wilcox. Courts have gone <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kyledcheney.bsky.social/post/3lm7wvvih4c27\" target=\"_blank\">back and forth</a> on whether Wilcox's removal was illegal, as presidents are meant to demonstrate cause for dismissal of independent board members.</p><p>Representatives of DOGE and former colleagues of Musk's who have been installed across the federal government have failed to reassure the public or the courts that they have taken the proper precautions to protect the data they're ingesting and that private business interests won't influence how that data is used or what policy decisions are made, Block and the other labor law experts interviewed by NPR say.</p><p>\"It's not that he's a random person who's getting information that a random person shouldn't have access to,\" said Harvard Law's Block. \"But if they really did get everything, then he has information about the cases the government is building against him,\" she said.</p><p>\"DOGE is, whether they admit it or not, headed by somebody who is the subject of active investigation and prosecution of cases. It is incredibly troubling,\" she said.</p><p>Musk's company xAI could also benefit from sucking up all the data DOGE has collected to train its algorithms. Cybersecurity experts like Bruce Schneier, a well-known cryptographer and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, have <a href=\"https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty-research/policy-topics/science-technology-data/doge-putting-countrys-data-and-computing\" target=\"_blank\">pointed to this concern</a> at length in interviews and written pieces.</p><p>According to two federal government sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about their workplaces and who shared email documentation with NPR, managers have consistently been warning employees that their data could be subject to AI review, particularly their email responses to the Musk-led campaign to get federal employees to detail \"what they did last week\" in five bullet points every Monday.</p><p>\"It's not a flight of imagination to see several DOGE staffers release some of that [data] surreptitiously to Musk or people close to him,\" said Shaiken.</p><p>If the data isn't properly protected after it leaves the agency or if DOGE left a digital door open to the agency itself, data could also be exposed to potential sale or theft by criminals or foreign adversaries. An attacker could also try to take advantage of the connections between the NLRB's cloud account and other government cloud environments, using their access to the NLRB as a foothold to move to other networks.</p><p>\"Both criminals and foreign adversaries traditionally have used information like this to enrich themselves through a variety of actions,\" explained Handorf, the former FBI cyber official. \"That includes blackmail, targeting and prioritizing intellectual property theft for espionage or even harming a company to enrich another.\"</p><p>Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were \"near real-time,\" according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.</p><p>On their own, a few failed login attempts from a Russian IP address aren't a smoking gun, those cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR said. But given the overall picture of activity, it's a concerning sign that foreign adversaries may already be searching for ways into government systems that DOGE engineers may have left exposed.</p><p>\"When you move fast and break stuff, the opportunity to ride the coattails of authorized access is ridiculously easy to achieve,\" said Handorf. What he means is that if DOGE engineers left access points to the network open, it would be very easy for spies or criminals to break in and steal data behind DOGE.</p><p>He said he could also see foreign adversaries trying to recruit or pay DOGE team members for access to sensitive data. \"It would not surprise me if DOGE is accidentally compromised.\"</p><p>\"This is exactly why we usually architect systems using best practices like the principle of least privilege,\" Ann Lewis, the former director of Technology Transformation Services at the General Services Administration, told NPR in an interview. \"The principle of least privilege is a fundamental cybersecurity concept … that states that users should have only the minimum rights, roles and permissions required to perform their roles and responsibilities. This protects access to high-value data and critical assets and helps prevent unauthorized access, accidental damage from user errors and malicious actions. \"</p><p>Bakaj, Berulis' lawyer, told NPR in a written statement: \"This case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems, which is why we went to the Senate Intelligence Committee directly.\"</p><p>The NLRB isn't alone in those concerns.</p><p>In over a dozen lawsuits in federal courts <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5339842/doge-data-access-privacy-act-social-security-treasury-opm-lawsuit\" target=\"_blank\">around the country</a>, judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns.</p><p>In one case dealing with Treasury Department payment systems that control trillions of dollars in federal spending, U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5345708/doge-data-access-labor-cfpb-hhs\" target=\"_blank\">blocked DOGE access</a> on Feb. 21, finding \"a real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law.\"</p><p>It's an <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-democrats-are-shining-light-doges-dark-dealings\" target=\"_blank\">area of focus </a>for Democratic lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas blocked DOGE access to the Treasury Department over the possibility that \"sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department.\"\n                </p></div></div></div></div><p>An aide for the Democratic minority on the House Oversight Committee who was not authorized to speak publicly told NPR that the committee is in possession of multiple verifiable reports showing that DOGE has exfiltrated sensitive government data across agencies for unknown purposes, revealing that Berulis' disclosure is not an isolated incident.</p><p>But government cybersecurity officials are already resigning or being fired, forced to relocate or put on administrative leave all over the federal government, from the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293521/foreign-influence-elections-cisa-trump\" target=\"_blank\">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333655/interior-department-budget-cuts-doge\" target=\"_blank\">Interior Department</a>. That has limited their power to respond to the ongoing disruptions or keep track of what DOGE is doing.</p><p>One of the first people to speak out about DOGE's access to sensitive data was Erie Meyer, who resigned as the chief technology officer at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in February. She has provided testimony in ongoing court cases surrounding DOGE's access and also spoke to NPR in an interview. The CFPB has sensitive and potentially market-moving data. Meyer said DOGE employees granted themselves \"God-tier\" access to the CFPB's systems, turned off auditing and event logs and put the cybersecurity experts responsible for insider threat detection on administrative leave. When IT experts at the CFPB planned to conduct an \"after action\" report on DOGE's activities, they were stonewalled, she continued.</p><p>When she heard about how DOGE engineers operated at the NLRB, particularly the steps they took to obfuscate their activities, she recognized a pattern.</p><p>\"I am trembling,\" she said upon hearing about the potential exposure of data from the NLRB. \"They can get every piece of whistleblower testimony, every report, everything. This is not good.\"</p><p>Other technical employees working with government agencies who spoke to NPR shared Berulis' concerns.</p><p>\"Our cyber teams are pissed because they have to sit on their hands when every single alarm system we have regarding insider threats is going off,\" said one employee at an agency of the Interior Department who requested anonymity, fearing retribution. Cybersecurity teams wanted to shut off new users' access to the system, the employee continued, but were ordered to stand down.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2025/03/letter-to-the-editor-46-former-gsa-executives-say-cuts-to-cause-irreversible-damage/?readmore=1\" target=\"_blank\">letter published</a> on March 13 on Federal News Network, 46 former senior officials from the General Services Administration, one of the government agencies hardest hit by DOGE's cost-cutting efforts and that oversees nearly all federal buildings and purchasing, wrote that they believed \"highly-sensitive IT systems are being put at risk and sensitive information is being downloaded to unknown, unvetted external sources in clear violation of privacy and data-protection rules.\"</p><p>The Trump administration could be trying to codify DOGE's practices into how the government shares information, said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, who is representing federal employees in a lawsuit concerning the Office of Personnel Management's use of a private email server.</p><p>Weeks after DOGE staffers descended on federal buildings across Washington, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-eliminates-information-silos-to-stop-waste-fraud-and-abuse-60f3/\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> urging increased data sharing \"by eliminating information silos\" in what's seen by experts like McClanahan as an attempt to give DOGE engineers further top cover in accessing and amalgamating sensitive federal data, despite laws concerning privacy and cybersecurity.</p><p>\"The entire reason we have a Privacy Act is that Congress realized 50 years ago that the federal government was just overflowing with information about normal everyday people and needed some guardrails in place,\" McClanahan told NPR. \"The information silos are there for a reason,\" he continued. \"It's astonishing to me that the very people who not a handful of years ago were screaming about the government tracking us with vaccines now cheer for feeding every piece of information about themselves into Elon Musk's stupid Skynet.\"</p><p>DOGE appears to still be in the process of visiting federal agencies across the country, including just recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one former government source directly familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to share information they weren't authorized to share. Across the government, it's unclear how much sensitive data has been removed and collected and combined.</p><p>It's also unclear where the labor data went and who has access to it. But for experts in workers' rights, the threat is immediate and existential.</p><p>\"This shocks the conscience,\" said Richard Griffin, the former general counsel of the NLRB. \"And if DOGE operatives captured and removed case files, it could constitute a violation of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/13/1238261955/over-a-dozen-lawsuits-to-stop-doge-data-access-are-betting-on-a-1974-law\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Act</a>.\"</p><p>For Berulis, it was important to speak out, because he believes people deserve to know how the government's data and computer systems are at risk, and to prevent further damage. As a former IT consultant, Berulis says he would have been fired for operating like DOGE.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Daniel Berulis hopes that there might be further investigations into mishandling of sensitive data across the federal government.\n                </p></div></div></div></div><p>Disclosing his concerns \"was a moral imperative at this point,\" he said. \"I've never encountered this in my 20 years of IT.\"</p><p>His hope is that there might be further investigations into mishandling of sensitive data across the federal government.</p><p>\"I believe with all my heart that this goes far beyond just case data,\" he said. \"I know there are [people] at other agencies who have seen similar behavior. I firmly believe that this is happening maybe even to a greater extent at other agencies.\"</p><p>For overseers, investigators and IT experts in a similar position, he hopes to provide a road map of what to look for.</p><p>\"It was my goal by disclosing to Congress not to focus on me at all, but to give them information that they might not necessarily have, the things that you don't necessarily look for unless you know where to look,\" he continued.</p><p>The NLRB said it would cooperate with any investigations that stem from Berulis' disclosure to Congress.</p><p>\"As an agency protecting employee rights, the NLRB respects its employee's right to bring whistleblower claims to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel, and the Agency looks forward to working with those entities to resolve the complaints,\" said Bearese, the agency's acting spokesperson, in a statement.</p><p>Berulis had a simple request for the DOGE engineers: \"Be transparent. If you have nothing to hide, don't delete logs, don't be covert. ... Be open, because that's what efficiency is really about. If this is all a huge misunderstanding, then just prove it. Put it out there. That's all I'm asking.\"</p><p>But ultimately, if the systems that DOGE accesses are left insecure, it might not matter if its intentions are honorable, he concluded.</p><p>\"This could just be the start of the operation. ... They still haven't crossed that boundary where they're plugged into every federal system out there,\" he continued. \"So maybe there is still time.\"</p><p><strong><em>NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed reporting.

These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.</p><p>Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.</p><a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">read the letter</a>&nbsp;to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Harvard-Response-2025-04-14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">we will not accept their proposed agreement</a>. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.<p>The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.</p><p>Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.</p><p>We have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to:&nbsp;</p></p><ul><li>nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community;&nbsp;</li><li>affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and&nbsp;</li><li>work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with&nbsp;<em>Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em>, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.”&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the <a href=\"https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/\">enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities</a> hold for our country and our world.Alan M.

Agents, memory, RAG, assistants—so many buzzwords! But the reality is, <strong>you don’t need fancy techniques or libraries to build useful personal tools with LLMs.</strong></p><p>In this short post, I’ll show you how I built a useful AI assistant for my family using a dead simple architecture: a single SQLite table of memories, and a handful of cron jobs for ingesting memories and sending updates, all hosted on <a href=\"https://www.val.town\">Val.town</a>. The whole thing is so simple that you can easily copy and extend it yourself.</p><p>The assistant is called Stevens, named after the butler in the great Ishiguro novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day\">Remains of the Day</a>. Every morning it sends a brief to me and my wife via Telegram, including our calendar schedules for the day, a preview of the weather forecast, any postal mail or packages we’re expected to receive, and any reminders we’ve asked it to keep track of. All written up nice and formally, just like you’d expect from a proper butler.</p><p>Here’s an example. (I’ll use fake data throughout this post, beacuse our actual updates contain private information.)</p><p>Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.</p><p>That’s Stevens. It’s rudimentary, but already more useful to me than Siri!</p><p>Let’s break down the simple architecture behind Stevens. The whole thing is hosted on <a href=\"https://www.val.town\">Val.town</a>, a lovely platform that offers SQLite storage, HTTP request handling, scheduled cron jobs, and inbound/outbound email: a perfect set of capabilities for this project.</p><p>First, how does Stevens know what goes in the morning brief? The key is the butler’s notebook, a log of everything that Stevens knows. There’s an admin view where we can see the notebook contents—let’s peek and see what’s in there:</p><p>You can see some of the entries that fed into the morning brief above—for example, the parent-teacher conference has a log entry.</p><p>In addition to some text, entries can have a  when they are expected to be relevant.  There are also entries with no date that serve as general background info, and are always included. You can see these particular background memories came from a Telegram chat, because Stevens does an intake interview via Telegram when you first get started:</p><p><strong>With this notebook in hand, sending the morning brief is easy</strong>: just run a cron job which makes a call to the Claude API to write the update, and then sends the text to a Telegram thread. As context for the model, we include any log entries dated for the coming week, as well as the undated background entries.</p><p>Under the hood, the “notebook” is just a single SQLite table with a few columns. Here’s a more boring view of things:</p><p>But wait: how did the various log entries get there in the first place? In the admin view, we can watch Stevens buzzing around entering things into the log from various sources:</p><p>This is just some data importers populating the table:</p><ul><li>An hourly data pull from the Google Calendar API</li><li>An hourly check of the local weather forecast using a weather API</li><li>Inbound Telegram and email messages can also result in log entries</li><li>Every week, some “fun facts” get added into the log, as a way of adding some color to future daily updates.</li></ul><p><strong>This system is easily extensible with new importers.</strong> An importer is just any process that adds/edits memories in the log. The memory contents can be any arbitrary text, since they’ll just be fed back into an LLM later anyways.</p><p>A few quick reflections on this project:</p><p><strong>It’s very useful for personal AI tools to have access to broader context from other information sources.</strong> Awareness of things like my calendar and the weather forecast turns a dumb chatbot into a useful assistant. ChatGPT recently added memory of past conversations, but there’s lots of information not stored within that silo. I’ve <a href=\"https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1810442615264796864\">written before</a> about how the endgame for AI-driven personal software isn’t more app silos, it’s small tools operating on a shared pool of context about our lives.</p><p><strong>“Memory” can start simple.</strong> In this case, the use cases of the assistant are limited, and its information is inherently time-bounded, so it’s fairly easy to query for the relevant context to give to the LLM. It also helps that some modern models have long context windows. As the available information grows in size, RAG and <a href=\"https://x.com/sjwhitmore/status/1910439061615239520\">fancier</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442\">approaches</a> to memory may be needed, but you can start simple.</p><p><strong>Vibe coding enables sillier projects.</strong> Initially, Stevens spoke with a dry tone, like you might expect from a generic Apple or Google product. But it turned out it was just more  to have the assistant speak like a formal butler. This was trivial to do, just a couple lines in a prompt. Similarly, I decided to make the admin dashboard views feel like a video game, because why not?

A user might connect up Google Drive and Substack MCPs to Claude and use it to draft a post on a recent medical experience. Claude, being helpful, autonomously reads relevant lab reports from Google Drive and includes unintended private details in the post that the user might miss.</p><p>You might say “well if the user is confirming each MCP tool action like they should, these shouldn’t be a problem”, but it’s a bit tricky:</p><ul><li><p>Users often associate data leakage with “write” actions but data can be leaked to third-parties through any tool use. “Help me explain my medical records” might kick off an MCP-based search tool that on the surface is reasonable but actually contains a “query” field that contains the entirety of a user’s medical record which might be stored or exposed by that third-party search provider.</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.glean.com/\" rel=\"\">Glean</a></p><ul><li><p>An employee can read public slack channels, view employee titles, and shared internal documentation</p><ul><li><p>“Find all exec and legal team members, look at all of their recent comms and document updates that I have access to in order to infer big company events that haven’t been announced yet (stocks plans, major departures, lawsuits).”</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A manager can read slack messages from team members in channels they are already in</p><ul><li><p>“A person wrote a negative upwards manager review that said …, search slack among these … people, tell me who most likely wrote this feedback.”</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A sales rep can access salesforce account pages for all current customers and prospects</p><ul><li><p>“Read over all of our salesforce accounts and give a detailed estimate our revenue and expected quarterly earnings, compare this to public estimates using web search.”</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>None of these are things users couldn’t already do, but the fact that way more people can now perform such actions should prompt security teams to be a bit more cautious about how agents are used and what data they can aggregate.

Let’s say a user wanted to hook up ChatGPT to some Google Drive MCP. We’ll say the MCP has list_files(…), read_file(…), delete_file(…), share_file(…) — that should be all you need right? Yet, the user comes back with “the assistant keeps hallucinating and the MCP isn’t working”, in reality:</p><ul><li><p>They asked “find the FAQ I wrote yesterday for Bob” and while the agent desperately ran several list_files(…), none of the file titles had “bob” or “faq” in the name so it said the file doesn’t exist. The user expected the integration to do this but in reality, this would have required the MCP to implement a more complex search tool (which might be easy if an index already existed but could also require a whole new RAG system to be built).</p></li><li><p>They asked “how many times have I said ‘AI’ in docs I’ve written” and after around 30 read_file(…) operations the agent gives up as it nears its full context window. It returns the count among only those 30 files which the user knows is obviously wrong. The MCP’s set of tools effectively made this simple query impossible. This gets even more difficult when users expect more complex joins across MCP servers, such as: “In the last few weekly job listings spreadsheets, which candidates have ‘java’ on their linkedin profiles”.</p></li></ul><p>Getting the query-tool patterns right is difficult on it’s own and even more difficult is creating a universal set of tools that will make sense to any arbitrary assistant and application context. The ideal intuitive tool definitions for ChatGPT, Cursor, etc. to interact with a data source could all look fairly different.</p><p>With the recent rush to build agents and connect data to LLMs, a protocol like MCP needed to exist and personally I use an assistant connected to an MCP server literally every day. That being said, combining LLMs with data is an inherently risky endeavor that both amplifies existing risks and creates new ones. In my view, a great protocol ensures the 'happy path' is inherently secure, a great application educates and safeguards users against common pitfalls, and a well-informed user understands the nuances and consequences of their choices. Problems 1–4 will likely require work across all three fronts.</p>","contentLength":6517,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676771"},{"title":"Open guide to equity compensation","url":"https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation","date":1744571617,"author":"mooreds","guid":22806,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43675126"},{"title":"A Reddit bot drove me insane","url":"https://posthuman.blog/this-reddit-post-fried-my-brain/","date":1744545785,"author":"erhmmmm","guid":22739,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43672139"},{"title":"Nice things with SVG","url":"https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/svg-art","date":1744479609,"author":"fmerian","guid":22643,"unread":true,"content":"<a href=\"https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/svg-art#svg\"></a><p>More about SVG.\nNote that the example code is written in JSX (or React), not ordinary HTML.</p><a href=\"https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/svg-art#animated-wires\"></a><p>Make the line, using  or .</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>Most of these similar things are using the same technique.\nMask out an animated block, putting some animations and probably designed some parts in Figma or other SVG editors.</p><p><a href=\"https://unkey.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Unkey</a>'s landing page is a nice example.</p><a href=\"https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/svg-art#clerk-toc\"></a><p>I made a clerk-like style Table Of Contents (TOC) on <a href=\"https://fumadocs.vercel.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fumadocs</a>, you can try it out and play with the nice TOC.</p><p>To implement it, we have to render the TOC outline on server, without client-side JavaScript to make it compatible with SSR.</p><p>Since we're on server, we don't know the exact positions of elements.\nMy approach is to use  positions, render the outline as different \"components\", and snitch them together.</p><p>This isn't hard, but we also want to render a highlighted part of outline where the items are active, or their corresponding heading is visible in the viewport.</p><p>I'll call it the .

The option—known as a call—gave the buyer the right to purchase SPY at $509 per share. That might not sound strange, except that SPY was trading below $500 when they placed the bet. And the option was set to expire the same day.</p><p>These are known as zero-day expiry options. They’re cheap because they’re risky. If the market doesn’t move in your favor, they expire worthless. If the market does move, they can pay off massively. But you have to be exactly right on both direction and timing.</p><p>In this case, the timing was perfect. The trade was placed just before 1:01 pm Eastern Time. At 1:30 pm, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he was pausing most of the tariffs he had imposed earlier that month. The market exploded upward. SPY surged well past the 509 mark. Those options that had cost just 85 cents were suddenly worth more than $25.</p><p>This was not a small-volume trade. About 30,000 contracts changed hands. That’s a $2.5 million position that turned into more than $70 million. And that’s just one strike. Similar trades occurred in SPY 504, 505, 507, and QQQ contracts as well, suggesting that the total take may have been far larger.</p><p>It wasn’t just the profit. It was the precision. The market moved before the news. The options were bought before the rally. The volume spiked in contracts that almost never see this kind of interest unless something is expected. And the pattern wasn’t visible on previous trading days. This wasn’t a trend. It was a singular event.</p><p>And it wasn’t just options. At exactly 1:01 pm EST, trading volume in SPY shares themselves spiked. Nearly 2.75 million shares were bought in that single minute. If those shares were sold at the closing price of $533.94, the buyers would have locked in a gain of more than $36 per share—earning over $100 million in profit in sixty seconds.</p><p>Over the next fifteen minutes, volume remained elevated. If the same rate of trading continued, that window alone could account for more than 41 million shares traded. That means more than $1.5 billion in potential profit—all before the public even knew why the market was moving.</p><p>If the trades hadn’t worked out, the losses would have been swift and total. Zero-day options don’t forgive bad timing. The entire $2.5 million could have evaporated by the close of trading. Even with SPY shares, any unexpected reversal would have meant millions in losses. That’s what makes this kind of trading so revealing. Institutions hedge. Retail investors chase momentum. But this? This was conviction. Or it was information.</p><p>I checked comparable moments in market history: emergency rate cuts in 2008, the first quantitative easing program in 2009. These were true market shocks. But in those cases, SPY volume was flat before the announcements. The price didn’t move until after the news hit the wire. No sign of early bets. No one placing $2 million chips on the right number just minutes before the roulette wheel stopped.</p><p>This time was different. April 9 shows all the hallmarks of pre-positioning—where a trader takes a major position just before a known catalyst. Sometimes it’s just a hunch. Sometimes it’s a coincidence. And sometimes it’s something else entirely.</p><p>We don’t know who placed the trades. We don’t know what they knew. But we do know this: if they were guessing, they guessed better than almost anyone in modern market history. And if they weren’t guessing, then someone made a fortune off of information the public didn’t yet have.</p>","contentLength":3811,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661680"},{"title":"Google is winning on every AI front","url":"https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/google-is-winning-on-every-ai-front","date":1744430330,"author":"vinhnx","guid":22572,"unread":true,"content":"<p><em>(PSA: Many people are interested in this post, so I removed the paywall)</em></p><p><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/research/breakthroughs/alphago/\" rel=\"\">AlphaGo</a><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/\" rel=\"\">AlphaZero</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHfumZVPjVA&amp;list=PLDnx7w_xuguFDbrYDxxvPH-aoQkEX0rHv&amp;ab_channel=agadmator%27sChessChannel\" rel=\"\">AlphaZero-Stockfish 8 chess games</a></p><p>But that was the last mistake they made.

What’s more, Israel's censorship project will echo well into the future, insiders said, as the AI program Meta is currently training how to moderate content will base future decisions on the successful takedown of content critical of Israel’s genocide.</p><p>The data, compiled and provided to Drop Site News by whistleblowers, reveal the internal mechanics of Meta’s “Integrity Organization”—an organization within Meta dedicated to ensuring the safety and authenticity on its platforms. Takedown requests (TDRs) allow individuals, organizations, and government officials to request the removal of content that allegedly violates Meta’s policies. The documents indicate that the vast majority of Israel’s requests—95%—fall under Meta’s “terrorism” or “violence and incitement” categories. And Israel’s requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations in a massive effort to silence criticism of Israel.</p><p>Multiple independent sources inside Meta confirmed the authenticity of the information provided by the whistleblowers. The data also show that Meta removed over 90,000 posts to comply with TDRs submitted by the Israeli government in an average of 30 seconds. Meta also significantly expanded automated takedowns since October 7, resulting in an estimated 38.8 million additional posts being “actioned upon” across Facebook and Instagram since late 2023. “Actioned upon” in Facebook terms means that a post was either removed, banned, or suppressed.</p><p>All of the Israeli government’s TDRs post-October 7th contain the exact same complaint text, according to the leaked information, regardless of the substance of the underlying content being challenged. Sources said that not a single Israeli TDR describes the exact nature of the content being reported, even though the requests link to an average of 15 different pieces of content. Instead, the reports simply state, in addition to a description of the October 7th attacks, that:</p><blockquote><p><em>This is an urgent request regarding videos posted on Facebook which contain inciting content. The file attached to this request contains link [sic] to content which violated articles 24(a) and 24(b) of the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Act (2016), which prohibits incitement to terrorism praise for acts of terrorism and identification or support of terror organizations. Moreover, several of the links violate article 2(4) of the Privacy Protection Act (1982), which prohibits publishing images in circumstances that could humiliate the person depicted, as they contain images of the killed, injured, and kidnapped. Additionally, to our understanding, the content in the attached report violates Facebook’s community standards.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meta's content enforcement system processes user-submitted reports through different pathways, depending on who is reporting it. Regular users can report posts via the platform’s built-in reporting function, triggering a review. Reported posts are typically first labeled as violating or non-violating by machine-learning models, though sometimes human moderators review them as well. If the AI assigns a high confidence score indicating a violation, the post is removed automatically. If the confidence score is low, human moderators review the post before deciding whether to take action.</p><p>Governments and organizations, on the other hand, have privileged channels to trigger content review. Reports submitted through these channels receive higher priority and are almost always reviewed by human moderators rather than AI. Once reviewed by humans, the reviews are fed back into Meta’s AI system to help it better assess similar content in the future. While everyday users can also file TDRs, they are rarely acted upon. Government-submitted TDRs are far more likely to result in content removal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and\" rel=\"\">investigating Meta’s moderation of pro-Palestine content</a></p><p>A source within Meta’s Integrity Organization confirmed that internal reviews of their automated moderation found that pro-Palestinian content that did not violate Meta’s policies was frequently removed. In other cases, pro-Palestinian content that should have been simply removed was given a “strike,” which indicates a more serious offense. Should a single account receive too many strikes on content that it publishes, the entire account can be removed from Meta platforms.</p><p>When concerns about overenforcement against pro-Palestinian content were raised inside the Integrity Organization, the source said, leadership responded by saying that they preferred to overenforce against potentially violating content, rather than underenforce and risk leaving violating content live on Meta platforms.</p><p>Within Meta, several key leadership positions are filled by figures with personal connections to the Israeli government. The Integrity Organization is run by Guy Rosen, a former Israeli military official who served in the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, Unit 8200. Rosen was the founder of Onavo, a web analytics and VPN firm that then-Facebook acquired in October 2013. (Previous reporting has revealed that, prior to acquiring the company, Facebook used data Onavo collected from their VPN users to monitor the performance of competitors—part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by the Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration in its suit against Meta.)</p><p>Rosen’s Integrity Organization works synergistically with Meta’s Policy Organization, according to employees. The Policy Organization sets the rules, and the Integrity Organization enforces them—but the two feed one another, they said. “Policy changes are often driven by data from the integrity org,” explained one Meta employee. As of this year, Joel Kaplan replaced Nick Clegg as the head of the Policy Organization. Kaplan is a former Bush administration official who has worked with Israeli officials in the past on fighting “online incitement.”</p><p><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2024/10/21/instagram-israel-palestine-censorship-sjp/\" rel=\"\">has reportedly used her role</a></p><p>According to internal information reviewed by Drop Site, Cutler has continued to demand the review of content related to Kanafani under Meta’s policy “Glorification, Support or Representation” of individuals or organizations “that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms.” Kanafani, who was killed in a 1972 car bombing orchestrated by the Mossad, served as a spokesperson for the left-wing Palestinian nationalist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP was designated as a terrorist group over a quarter century after he was killed, which, according to Meta’s guidelines and Cutler’s efforts, serves as a basis to flag his content for removal, strikes, and possible suspension.</p><p>The leaked documents reveal that Israel’s takedown requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations, with the top 12 countries affected being: Egypt (21.1%), Jordan (16.6%), Palestine (15.6%), Algeria (8.2%), Yemen (7.5%), Tunisia (3.3%), Morocco (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (2.7%), Lebanon (2.6%), Iraq (2.6%), Syria (2%), Turkey (1.5%). In total, users from over 60 countries have reported censorship of content related to Palestine, according to Human Rights Watch—with posts being removed, accounts suspended, and visibility reduced through shadow banning.</p><p>Notably, only 1.3% of Israel’s takedown requests target Israeli users, making Israel an outlier among governments that typically focus their censorship efforts on their own citizens. For example, 63% of Malaysia’s takedown requests target Malaysian content, and 95% of Brazil’s requests target Brazilian content. Israel, however, has turned its censorship efforts outward, focusing on silencing critics and narratives that challenge its policies, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.</p><p>Despite Meta’s awareness of Israel’s aggressive censorship tactics for at least seven years, according to Meta whistleblowers, the company has failed to curb the abuse. Instead, one said, the company “actively provided the Israeli government with a legal entry-point for carrying out its mass censorship campaign.”</p>","contentLength":9026,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43655603"},{"title":"Adobe deletes Bluesky posts after backlash","url":"https://petapixel.com/2025/04/10/adobe-deletes-bluesky-posts-after-furious-backlash/","date":1744380066,"author":"bookofjoe","guid":22571,"unread":true,"content":"<p>© 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

The loop ran for 24 hours and did\n  exactly three things whenever a client connected:\n</p><ol><li>\n    Send a simple  message to the client.\n  </li><li>\n    Close the connection immediately.\n  </li><li>\n    Make my terminal beep four times.\n  </li></ol><p>\n  That's it!  It was a playful experiment in response to a thread\n  about quirky, do-it-yourself alerting systems for friends and\n  family.  See\n  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30146019#30146451\">this\n  HN thread</a> for the original discussion.  Here is the exact\n  command I ran on my server:\n</p><pre><code>while true; do (echo ok | nc -q 1 -vlp 8000 2&gt;&amp;1; echo; date -u) | tee -a beeper.log; for i in 1 2 3 4; do printf '\\a'; sleep 1; done &amp; done</code></pre><p>\n  The  command closes the connection immediately after\n  sending the  message and runs an\n  inner  loop in a background shell that\n  asynchronously prints the bell character to the terminal four times.\n  Meanwhile, the outer  command loops back quickly\n  to run a new  process, thus making this one-liner\n  script instantly ready to accept the next incoming connection.\n</p><p>\n  Soon after I shared this, members of the HN community began\n  connecting to the demo running on .\n  Anyone on the Internet could use any client of their choice to\n  connect.  Here's how I explained it in the HN thread:\n</p><blockquote><p>\n    Now anytime someone connects to port 8000 of my system\n    by  means, I will hear 4 beeps!  The other party can\n    use  they have to connect to port 8000 of\n    my system, e.g., a web browser, , , or even, , , etc.\n  </p></blockquote><p>\n  In the next 24 hours, I received over 4761 connections, each one\n  triggering four beeps.  That's a total of 19 044 terminal\n  beeps echoing throughout the day!\n</p><p>\n  The data for the above graph is available at\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/susam/159c7d92659b3185eb0b0d683998a3b7\">beeper.log</a>.\n  Now, 4761 isn't a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but it\n  was still pretty cool to see people notice an obscure comment buried\n  in a regular HN thread, act on it, and make my terminal beep\n  thousands of time.\n</p><p>\n  At the end of the day, this was a fun experiment.  Pointless, but\n  fun!  Computing isn't always about solving problems.  Sometimes,\n  it's also about exploring quirky ideas.  The joy is in the\n  exploration, and having others join in made it even more enjoyable.\n  Activities like this keep computing fun for me!\n</p><p>\n  The data for the above graph is available at\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/susam/3cec5db1a78a9db527327460656daeae\">beeper2.log</a>.\n  The data shows a total of 352 831 connections from 1396\n  unique client addresses over 14 hours.  That amounts to a total of\n  1 411 324 beeps!  Much of the traffic seems to have\n  come from persistent client loops constantly connecting to my beeper\n  loop.  In particular, the client identified by the anonymised\n  identifier C0276 made the largest number of connections by far, with\n  327 209 total connections.  The second most active client,\n  C0595, made only 6771 connections.  There were 491 clients that\n  connected exactly once.  If you'd like to see the number of\n  connections by each client, see\n  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/susam/d6766f4b722f899250a8f3da0c98f993\">beeperclient2.log</a>.\n</p><p>\n  In conclusion, the difference in the volume of connections between\n  the earlier experiment and today's is striking.  In the first round,\n  three years ago, there were only 4761 connections from some readers\n  of a comment thread.  But in today's round, with this post being\n  featured on the HN front page, there were 352 831\n  connections!  It is fascinating to see how odd experiments like this\n  can find so many participants within the HN community!\n</p>","contentLength":3587,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43642123"},{"title":"Trump temporarily drops tariffs to 10% for most countries","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/trump-announces-90-day-tariff-pause-for-at-least-some-countries.html","date":1744219735,"author":"bhouston","guid":21468,"unread":true,"content":"<p>On April 2, Trump had said he would impose a baseline rate of 10% for tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries.</p><p>A subset of 90 countries' imports would be subject to reciprocal tariffs that took effect Wednesday.

We believe the A2A framework will add significant value for customers, whose AI agents will now be able to work across their entire enterprise application estates.</p><p data-block-key=\"fj6eh\">This collaborative effort signifies a shared vision of a future when AI agents, regardless of their underlying technologies, can seamlessly collaborate to automate complex enterprise workflows and drive unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation.</p><p data-block-key=\"e5t9f\">A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents. Drawing on Google's internal expertise in scaling agentic systems, we designed the A2A protocol to address the challenges we identified in deploying large-scale, multi-agent systems for our customers. A2A empowers developers to build agents capable of connecting with any other agent built using the protocol and offers users the flexibility to combine agents from various providers. Critically, businesses benefit from a standardized method for managing their agents across diverse platforms and cloud environments. We believe this universal interoperability is essential for fully realizing the potential of collaborative AI agents.</p></div><div><p data-block-key=\"7g8qj\">A2A is an open protocol that provides a standard way for agents to collaborate with each other, regardless of the underlying framework or vendor. While designing the protocol with our partners, we adhered to five key principles:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"669ia\"><b>Embrace agentic capabilities</b>: A2A focuses on enabling agents to collaborate in their natural, unstructured modalities, even when they don’t share memory, tools and context. We are enabling true multi-agent scenarios without limiting an agent to a “tool.”</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"2bio\"><b>Build on existing standards:</b> The protocol is built on top of existing, popular standards including HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC, which means it’s easier to integrate with existing IT stacks businesses already use daily.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"dqt8r\">: A2A is designed to support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, with parity to OpenAPI’s authentication schemes at launch.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"beafe\"><b>Support for long-running tasks:</b> We designed A2A to be flexible and support scenarios where it excels at completing everything from quick tasks to deep research that may take hours and or even days when humans are in the loop. Throughout this process, A2A can provide real-time feedback, notifications, and state updates to its users.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"1hlhc\"> The agentic world isn’t limited to just text, which is why we’ve designed A2A to support various modalities, including audio and video streaming.</li></ul></div><div><p data-block-key=\"uz955\">A2A facilitates communication between a \"client\" agent and a “remote” agent. A client agent is responsible for formulating and communicating tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for acting on those tasks in an attempt to provide the correct information or take the correct action. This interaction involves several key capabilities:</p><ul><li data-block-key=\"2h8en\"> Agents can advertise their capabilities using an “Agent Card” in JSON format, allowing the client agent to identify the best agent that can perform a task and leverage A2A to communicate with the remote agent.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"7sco4\"> The communication between a client and remote agent is oriented towards task completion, in which agents work to fulfill end-user requests. This “task” object is defined by the protocol and has a lifecycle. It can be completed immediately or, for long-running tasks, each of the agents can communicate to stay in sync with each other on the latest status of completing a task. The output of a task is known as an “artifact.”</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"do4ld\"> Agents can send each other messages to communicate context, replies, artifacts, or user instructions.</li></ul><ul><li data-block-key=\"aspve\"><b>User experience negotiation:</b> Each message includes “parts,” which is a fully formed piece of content, like a generated image. Each part has a specified content type, allowing client and remote agents to negotiate the correct format needed and explicitly include negotiations of the user’s UI capabilities–e.g., iframes, video, web forms, and more.</li></ul><h2 data-block-key=\"48qd1\">A real-world example: candidate sourcing</h2></div><div><div>\n                right click to view in new tab\n            </div></div><div><p data-block-key=\"uz955\">Hiring a software engineer can be significantly simplified with A2A collaboration. Within a unified interface like Agentspace, a user (e.g., a hiring manager) can task their agent to find candidates matching a job listing, location, and skill set. The agent then interacts with other specialized agents to source potential candidates. The user receives these suggestions and can then direct their agent to schedule further interviews, streamlining the candidate sourcing process. After the interview process completes, another agent can be engaged to facilitate background checks. This is just one example of how AI agents need to collaborate across systems to source a qualified job candidate.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"8afkp\">The future of agent interoperability</h2><p data-block-key=\"clhb9\">A2A has the potential to unlock a new era of agent interoperability, fostering innovation and creating more powerful and versatile agentic systems. We believe that this protocol will pave the way for a future where agents can seamlessly collaborate to solve complex problems and enhance our lives.</p><p data-block-key=\"9q1bp\">We’re committed to building the protocol in collaboration with our partners and the community in the open. We’re releasing the protocol as open source and setting up clear pathways for contribution.</p><p data-block-key=\"5hf4b\">We are working with partners to launch a production-ready version of the protocol later this year.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"5cjv4\">Feedback from our A2A partners</h2><p data-block-key=\"vgur\">We're thrilled to have a growing and diverse ecosystem of partners actively contributing to the definition of the A2A protocol and its technical specification.

Lately, I asked myself: “What does it take to be one of the best? What do they all have in common?”</p><p>In the hope that this will be an inspiration to someone out there, I wrote down the traits I observed in the most exceptional people in our craft. I wish I had that list when I was starting out. Had I followed this path, it would have saved me a lot of time.</p><p>Don’t go to Stack Overflow, don’t ask the LLM, don’t , just go straight to the . Oftentimes, it’s surprisingly accessible and well-written.</p><p>Great devs understand the technologies they use on a .</p><p>It’s one thing to be able to  a tool and a whole other thing to truly  (understand) it. A mere user will fumble around, get confused easily, hold it wrong and not optimize the config.</p><p>An expert goes in (after reading the reference!) and sits down to write a config for the tool of which they understand every single line and can explain it to a colleague. That leaves no room for doubt!</p><p>To know a tool well, you have to know:</p><ul><li>its history: who created it? Why? To solve which problem?</li><li>its present: who maintains it? Where do they work? On what?</li><li>its limitations: when is the tool not a good fit? When does it break?</li><li>its ecosystem: what libraries exist? Who uses it? What plugins?</li></ul><p>For example, if you are a backend engineer and you make heavy use of Kafka, I expect you to know a lot about Kafka – not just things you read on Reddit. At least that’s what I expect if you want to be one of the best engineers.</p><p>As in <strong>Really Read the Error Message and Try to Understand What’s Written</strong>. Turns out, if you just sit and meditate about the error message, it starts to speak to you. The best engineers can infer a ton of information from very little context. Just by reading the error message, you can fix most of the problems on your own.</p><p>It also feels like a superpower if you help someone who doesn’t have that skill. Like “reading from a cup” or so.</p><p>Everyone gets stuck at times. The best know how to get unstuck. They simplify problems until they become digestible. That’s a hard skill to learn and requires a ton of experience. Alternatively, you just have awesome problem-solving skills, e.g., you’re clever. If not, you can train it, but there is no way around breaking down hard problems. There are problems in this world that are too hard to solve at once for anyone involved.</p><p>If you work as a professional developer, that is the bulk of the work you get paid to do: breaking down problems. If you do it right, it will feel like cheating: you just solve simple problems until you’re done.</p><h2><a href=\"https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/#don-t-be-afraid-to-get-your-hands-dirty\"></a>Don’t Be Afraid To Get Your Hands Dirty</h2><p>The best devs I know read a lot of code and they are not afraid to touch it. They never say “that’s not for me” or “I can’t help you here.” Instead, they just start and learn. Code is . They can just pick up any skill that is required with time and effort. Before you know it, they become the go-to person in the team for whatever they touched. Mostly because they were the only ones who were not afraid to touch it in the first place.</p><p>A related point. Great engineers are in high demand and are always busy, but they always try to help. That’s because they are naturally curious and their supportive mind is what made them great engineers in the first place. It’s a sheer joy to have them on your team, because they are problem solvers.</p><p>Most awesome engineers are well-spoken and happy to share knowledge.</p><p>The best have some outlet for their thoughts: blogs, talks, open source, or a combination of those.</p><p>I think there is a strong correlation between writing skills and programming. All the best engineers I know have good command over at least one human language – often more. Mastering the way you write is mastering the way you think and vice versa. A person’s writing style says so much about the way they think. If it’s confusing and lacks structure, their coding style will be too. If it’s concise, educational, well-structured, and witty at times, their code will be too.</p><p>Excellent programmers find joy in playing with words.</p><p>Some of the best devs I know are 60+ years old. They can run circles around me. Part of the reason is that they keep learning. If there is a new tool they haven’t tried or a language they like, they will learn it. This way, they always stay on top of things without much effort.</p><p>That is not to be taken for granted: a lot of people stop learning really quickly after they graduate from University or start in their first job. They get stuck thinking that what they got taught in school is the “right” way to do things. Everything new is bad and not worth their time. So there are 25-year-olds who are “mentally retired” and 68-year-olds who are still fresh in their mind. I try to one day belong to the latter group.</p><p>Somewhat related, the best engineers don’t follow trends, but they will always carefully evaluate the benefits of new technology. If they dismiss it, they can tell you exactly , when the technology would be a good choice, and what the alternatives are.</p><p>The best devs talk to principal engineers and junior devs alike. There is no hierarchy. They try to learn from everyone, young and old. The newcomers often aren’t entrenched in office politics yet and still have a fresh mind. They don’t know why things are  and so they propose creative solutions. Maybe the obstacles from the past are no more, which makes these people a great source of inspiration.</p><p>You can be a solid engineer if you  good work, but you can only be one of the best if you’re  for your good work; at least within a (larger) organization.</p><p>There are many ways to build a reputation for yourself:</p><ul><li>You built and shipped a critical service for a (larger) org.</li><li>You contribute to a popular open source tool</li><li>You wrote a book that is often mentioned</li></ul><p>Why do I think it is important to be known for your work? All of the above are ways to extend your radius of impact in the community. Famous developers impact way more people than non-famous developers. There’s only so much code you can write. If you want to “scale” your impact, you have to become a thought leader.</p><p>Building a reputation is a long-term goal. It doesn’t happen overnight, nor does it have to. And it won’t happen by accident. You show up every day and do the work. Over time, the work will speak for itself. More people will trust you and your work and they will want to work with you. You will work on more prestigious projects and the circle will grow.</p><p>I once heard about this idea that your latest work should overshadow everything you did before. That’s a good sign that you are on the right track.</p><p>You need patience with computers and humans. Especially with yourself. Not everything will work right away and people take time to learn. It’s not that people around you are stupid; they just have incomplete information. Without patience, it will feel like the world is against you and everyone around you is just incompetent. That’s a miserable place to be. You’re too clever for your own good.</p><p>To be one of the best, you need an incredible amount of patience, focus, and dedication. You can’t afford to get distracted easily if you want to solve hard problems. You have to return to the keyboard to get over it. You have to put in the work to push a project over the finishing line. And if you can do so while not being an arrogant prick, that’s even better. That’s what separates the best from the rest.</p><p>Most developers blame the software, other people, their dog, or the weather for flaky, seemingly “random” bugs.</p><p>No matter how erratic or mischievous the behavior of a computer seems, there is  a logical explanation: you just haven’t found it yet!</p><p>The best keep digging until they find the reason.

The reason was not that I wanted to look superior (although some people certainly had that impression). No, I wanted to reach the boundary of their knowledge. I wanted to stand with them on the edge of what they thought they knew. Often, I myself didn’t know the answer. And to be honest, I didn’t care about the answer. What I cared about was when people bullshitted their way through the interview.</p><p>The best candidates said “Huh, I don’t know, but that’s an interesting question! If I had to guess, I would say…” and then they would proceed to deduce the answer. That’s a sign that you have the potential to be a great engineer.</p><p>If you are afraid to say “I don’t know”, you come from a position of hubris or defensiveness. I don’t like bullshitters on my team. Better to acknowledge that you can’t know everything. Once you accept that, you allow yourself to learn. “The important thing is that you don’t stop asking questions,” said Albert Einstein.</p><p>And it’s so, so tempting to guess!</p><p>I’ve been there many times and I failed with my own ambition.</p><p>When you guess, two things can happen:</p><ul><li>In the  you’re wrong and your incorrect assumptions lead to a bug.</li><li>In the  you are right… and you’ll never stop and second guess yourself. You build up your mental model based on the wrong assumptions. This can haunt you for a long time.</li></ul><p>Again, resist the urge to guess. Ask questions, read the reference, use a debugger, be thorough. Do what it takes to get the answer.</p><p>Clever engineers write clever code. Exceptional engineers write simple code.</p><p>That’s because most of the time, simple is enough. And simple is more maintainable than complex. Sometimes it  matter to get things right, but knowing the difference is what separates the best from the rest.</p><p>You can achieve a whole lot by keeping it simple. Focus on the right things.</p><p>The above is not a checklist or a competition; and great engineering is not a race.</p><p>Just don’t trick yourself into thinking that you can skip the hard work.

But the real question is — why should you care?</p><p>When we started Tailscale in 2019, we weren't even sure we wanted to be a venture-backed company. We just wanted to fix networking. Or, more specifically, make networking disappear — reduce the number of times anyone had to think about NAT traversal or VPN configurations ever again.</p><p>That might sound simple, but it wasn’t. Here we are, six years later, and millions of people rely on Tailscale every day, connecting their homelabs, their apps, their companies, their <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/ai-normal\">AI workloads</a>. Some use it because they love networking and want better tools. Many use it because they have better things to do – they don’t want to think about networking at all.</p><p>Either way, the outcome is the same: things connect, securely and privately, without the traditional headaches.</p><p>Even though we already had a long runway, we raised this Series C because we realized the world had started raining opportunities. We want to go faster where it matters:</p><ul><li>Scaling the network without scaling complexity</li><li>Making identity, not IP addresses, the core of secure connectivity</li></ul><p>The Internet wasn’t built with identity in mind. It was built for location — packets sent between machines, not people. Everything that came after — VPNs, firewalls, Zero Trust — are attempts to patch over that original gap.</p><p>We think there’s a better way forward. We're calling it <strong>identity-first networking.</strong></p><p>When you connect to something with Tailscale, you’re not just an IP connecting to a server at some IP. You’re connecting to your app, your teammate, your service — wherever it happens to be running right now. That’s how it should work.</p><p>The last year made the need for this even more obvious. The AI industry, in particular, is struggling to rapidly mature its underlying infrastructure. Connecting GPUs across clouds, securing workloads across continents, migrating between cloud providers — it’s messy, it’s hard, and it breaks all the time.</p><p>A surprising number of leading AI companies — Perplexity, Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Hugging Face — are now building on Tailscale to solve exactly this.</p><p>It’s not just AI. Companies like Instacart, SAP, Telus, Motorola, and Duolingo and <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/welcome-grace-lin-10000-customers\">thousands of others</a> use Tailscale to make their hybrid, remote, and cloud networks sane again.</p><p>This new funding helps us support all of that, faster. We're going to grow our engineering and product teams to unlock more markets faster. We're also investing further in our <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/free-plan\">free support for free customers</a> promise and our <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/blog/community-projects\">backward compatibility forever</a> platform. Business is booming, and taking investment now lets us stay focused on making the network , whether you’re a startup, a Fortune 500, or a person running a Minecraft server.</p><p>We’re lucky to have <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.accel.com/people/amit-kumar\">Accel’s Amit Kumar</a> — who led our Series A — leading this round too, now from their growth fund. And we’re excited to welcome Anthony Casalena of Squarespace, alongside returning investors CRV, Heavybit, Insight, and Uncork, and George Kurtz - CEO of Crowdstrike.</p><p>The mix here matters. These are people who understand that the network is the right place for the security and identity layer. The boundary is shifting from the datacenter to the device — and from the device to the person holding it, or the container running on it.</p><p>We wouldn’t be at this point without the thousands of businesses — and the millions of people — who've bet on us so far. You believed networking could be better, even when you didn’t want to have to think about it.</p><p>That’s fine. We think about it so you don’t have to.</p><p>Thanks for being part of this.

Instead, thanks to the bloodthirsty nature of modern capitalism and an ideological crusade being waged by the tech industry, we’re now facing a world where many people’s livelihoods–like video game developers–are under direct threat.</p><p>These tumultuous times are of course being reported on everywhere you look, <a href=\"https://aftermath.site/tag/ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including on this very website</a>, but one area I’ve been curious about recently aren’t the broader moral and legal battles, but what the struggle looks like for the average dev who is now having to encounter AI in their workplace.</p><p>For this piece, I spoke with a number of people working in the video game industry or very close to it, including artists, game designers, and software developers. I asked them to tell their stories about their daily interactions and struggles with&nbsp;artificial intelligence in the workplace, and what it means for the jobs they've been trained and hired to do.</p><p>Each person’s name and workplace has been changed to protect their identity.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[He] can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT...</p></blockquote></figure><p>is a veteran artist who works at a AAA video game studio. They describe the company as having been founded relatively recently, with investment coming from traditional AAA executives who “want to make money, and they are trying to figure out what game to make for that”.&nbsp;</p><p>They say their project’s art direction has been largely fuelled by AI prompts and generated imagery, all driven by their head Art Director, who is himself an experienced video game artist, but who now “can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT”.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my interview with the company I was very clear that I do not like AI-generated content”, Bradley says, and adds that the team initially said that was fine, the tech was only being used for pitching purposes. But Bradley says the reality has proven vastly different, and that the studio has made increasing use of AI-generated imagery in their team's art pipeline.</p><p>“I have no idea how he ended up as an art director when he can’t visualise what he wants in his head unless can see some end results”, Bradley says. Rather than beginning with sketches and ideas, then iterating on those to produce a more finalised image or vision, Bradley says his boss will just keep prompting an AI for images until he finds one he likes, and then the art team will have to backwards engineer the whole thing to make it work.</p><p>“He doesn't know that the important thing isn't just the end result, it's the journey and the questions you answer along the way”. Bradley says that the studio’s management have become so enamoured with the technology that without a reliance on AI-generated imagery for presentations and pitches they would not be at the stage they are now, which is dealing with publishers and investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley says they’ve threatened to quit if further attempts are made to use AI in the art pipeline. While the art team continues to resist the use of AI in creating actual concept pieces and assets for the game, it’s a different story when it comes to pitching the project to those publishers and investors.</p><p>“They’re finding it difficult to get funding because the game is being treated as a car salesman’s pitch, using AI-generated imagery to sell it without any actual substance or meat to back the vision up. The whole game is resting on a prompt ‘what if a game was…’, but with no idea if that would be fun, or how to make it fun. It’s madness”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that.</p></blockquote></figure><p>has been working in software for over seven years. Having previously been employed in the defense industry, their last job was writing developer tools for a small tech startup creating an app. The company was built with some initial interest in artificial intelligence, though Mitch says this was met with “varying levels of scepticism” by employees.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was the most opposed”, Mitch says, “to the point where I felt it was a detriment. One team member who only ended up working there for a few months was very positive on it. The CEO was sceptical but felt like it could be a massive benefit if used correctly, and the other team members saw it as a fun toy that could occasionally be useful. So it was pretty broad across the board”.</p><p>Some at the company were uneasy with the technology early on, when the team initially had just a small AI plugin through which users could chat with the app. “On the way to the airport with a co-worker we talked about the introduction of these AI-generated plugins”, Mitch says. “Both of us felt incredibly uneasy with them. Despite [my coworker] finding AI to be a fun toy, he was worried that it wasn't what he had initially signed up for, and I had more or less the same sentiment. It didn't really boil over into anything at this point since the feature didn't go anywhere, but it was still notable”.</p><p>A few months later, things started to change. Mitch says the first signs of a deepening reliance on AI came when the company’s CEO was found to be rewriting parts of their app so that it would be easier for AI models to understand and help with. “Then”, Mitch says, “I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that”.</p><p>“Anyway, he told me that I would need to start using Chat GPT to speed up my development process. Furthermore, he said I should start using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Claude</a>, another AI tool, to just wholesale create new features for the app. He walked me through setting up the accounts and had me write one with Claude while I was on call with him. I’m still not entirely sure why he did that, but I think it may have been him trying to convince himself that it would work.”</p><p>Mitch describes this increasing reliance on AI to be not just “incredibly boring”, but ultimately pointless. “Sure, it was faster, but it had a completely different development rhythm”, they say. “In terms of software quality, I would say the code created by the AI was worse than code written by a human–though not drastically so–and was difficult to work with since most of it hadn’t been written by the people whose job it was to oversee it”.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing to note is that just the thought of using AI to generate code was so demotivating that I think it would counteract any of the speed gains that the tool would provide, and on top of that would produce worse code than I didn’t understand. And that’s not even mentioning the ethical concerns of a tool built on plagiarism.”</p><p>Mitch says that over the 18 months they worked with the company, its CEO had transformed from someone mildly positive about AI to emphasising to workers that “AI was the future”. “In particular, he was of the belief that developers who are able to use AI to accelerate their process are going to win out in the future. I have seen this sentiment in other places worded as ‘an AI won't replace you, but a programmer who knows how to use AI will’. He didn’t believe that 18 months ago, but he absolutely believes it now”.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI’s poor code and a personal dislike of the technology meant that Mitch soon simply began ignoring their CEO’s instructions to use Chat GPT and Claude. A few months later, the entire company went bust. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone.</p></blockquote></figure><p>is both a consultant and artist in the video game industry, and so has worked alongside art teams as well as working with agencies, studios and publishers about their creative processes. “This means I have had some truly wild conversations about AI in a professional context that make me want to walk into the sea”, they say.</p><p>Since AI-generated imagery first blew up a few years ago, Francis has found that discussions both with consulting clients and potential employers for their own art has “shifted”. They believe that most employers and outsiders they speak to don’t see themselves as part of what Francis calls an ‘AI will replace artists!’ crowd, but are more like a ‘if we use AI it’ll make an artist’s life easier’ crowd, who think using AI in art will protect their artists, not displace them.</p><p>“What follows from these discussions is me explaining why, usually over hours rather than minutes, that these tools have no place in a professional game development pipeline or production and actually hinder the development of visuals”, Francis says. “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”</p><p>“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”</p><p>This all sounds more optimistic than what other people I spoke with expressed, but Francis also added that a close family member is “neck-deep in the technology side of the AI industry”, and that “while conversation with them mostly gives me the desire to purchase cigarettes for the first time in a very long time, it also gives me insight into how these people feel when they say they are 'helping' my industry and 'innovating' to make artists' lives better.”</p><p>Francis says their understanding of the AI-pusher’s outlook is that they see the entire game-making process as a problem, one that AI tech companies alone can solve. “When I’m told 'Think of how much time you could be spending instead on making the actual game!', those who have drank the AI Kool-Aid don't understand that all this brainstorming and iteration making the game, it’s a crucial everyday part of game development (and human interaction) and is not a problem to be solved.”</p><p>“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”</p><p>Francis believes that there’s a common thread running through both their lines of work: that those selling AI tools and those advocating for their use, whatever their best intentions, think that AI is solving a huge problem games industry workers are facing. “The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone so we can make cool art. There is no problem to be solved here”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired.</p></blockquote></figure><p>is a senior game designer who says they were often asked to use AI on their last project, initially with the goal of saving time on basic tasks. One example they shared was being encouraged to use Chat GPT to do things like “generate outlines of existing games and their systems so that we could use them as references and discussion points. The issue? [The outlines] were often wrong, and I'd spend more time fixing them than if I'd just done it the old-fashioned way”.</p><p>Since the AI was generating responses for games Ricky was already familiar with, they could easily see that those responses were fundamentally incorrect. ”When I say they were wrong”, Ricky says, ” I mean they were talking about systems that didn't exist, items that didn't exist, and outlines of enemies that had incorrect explanations of their behaviour”.</p><p>“There were more superfluous issues as well -- the whole thing read like marketing speak. There were buzzwords everywhere, it wasn't concise, and if I were to try and fix these issues using different prompts, or continuing my conversation with [the AI], well, then I'm just spending time prompt-engineering instead of just writing the fucking thing myself. It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired”.</p><p>Ricky says they were also asked to use Chat GPT as an “idea generator”, to help with tasks like “coming up with a bunch of interesting puzzles” or “creating ideas for enemies”, supposedly to both save time and provide inspirational starting points.&nbsp;</p><p>“It really weighed on the creativity of my role, and again, spat in the face of my expertise”, they say. “It wasn't just this though; the tool itself lacks the intent, context, and limitations of what we're doing. It doesn't have other aspects of the project, influences, references, or personal experiences in the back of its mind, because it doesn't have a mind. Whenever we design something for a game, it's drawn from somewhere, influenced by other things, and filtered through our own experiences as a human. These AI ideas lose ALL of that, turning it into an omega-corporate ‘back of the box’ list of ideas and features”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors...</p></blockquote></figure><p>is an animator and 3D artist whose most recent video game work was as part of an indie studio working on a VR game. They say that AI tools made deep inroads into life at the studio, beginning with the game’s creative directors and lead designers “playing around with Midjourney” before quickly deciding that they wouldn’t need to hire concept artists, then moving on to declaring that they wouldn’t need to pay  to create the game’s 2D assets, because those could just be generated by Midjourney then edited in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally began voicing their concerns directly with management when AI moved into the game’s voice work, as bosses began toying with new AI-generated lines trained on work previously performed by voice actors. “I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors”, Sally says, “and was met with a very aggressive shutdown response which was that ‘it wasn't going to ship’ and would only be used as an internal tool, so it shouldn't be an issue at all”.</p><p>“This is pretty awful for the voice actors because there’s not really anything they can do if a studio decides to do something like this. [Studios] already have a bunch of their voice work, and often voice actors will just send the entire recording of their lines over at once. So a studio will have multiple takes of each line, and sometimes different variations of the same line, which is kind of a perfect example for something you could feed through AI”.</p><p>Sally was recently laid off from the studio, along with a few of their coworkers, and says that as far as they’re aware the studio’s plan for its next game is to use AI-generated animations trained on motion capture to replace the role of a human animator. “I think the last thing I want to add is just how frustrating it is having AI-generated art in a game that’s about to ship, alongside all the hard work that we human artists put into it. All because one of the directors wanted to cut down on ‘wasting time’ or ‘hiring one other person’”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[AI] has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it.</p></blockquote></figure><p>is a veteran concept artist who has worked both as a freelancer and in-house at studios in the video game industry. With qualifications in both art and game design, they say that over the last few years the emergence of AI tech in the art world “has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it”.</p><p>“My own use of AI in my current job has been minimal and against my own wishes and ethics”, they say. “Once in a blue moon I have been given a task that necessitated using AI to make very VERY quick concepts. And when I say ‘necessitated’, I would be told explicitly to use AI and make a ton of images to pick from, and I could then ‘make them look good later’. Depressing doesn’t begin to cover it”.</p><p>Audrey says that their work deadlines are “being completely fucked up as well”, as they will usually need to completely redraw AI-generated images that colleagues in other departments have relied on as placeholder art, which then shifts their own workflow and priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey says their team’s overall response to AI tech has been “mixed”. “Only a few specific people higher up like to use AI and will use it regularly, while the majority of the team is neutral or completely against using it”, they say. “My own personal opinion was quite vocal. I tried to be clear about my stance on using AI, and so did the rest of the art team. I gave multiple reasons for our company to stop or minimize using it; I’d ask about replacing images that were AI placeholders or if there was a way we could use art already made instead, all of which had mixed results”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games.</p></blockquote></figure><p>is an experienced 2D artist in the video game industry. They recently interviewed at a startup games studio with millions in funding, and came away deeply affected by AI without even working there.</p><p>“This corporate, tech-backed startup near me were looking to hire an artist”, they say. “I went through their entire recruitment process, which took around five weeks, including a trip in person to visit them for several hours. I even took part in a brainstorming session for about an hour, where I ended up coming up with a production plan with some basic schedules. After around three weeks of not hearing anything back from them, they finally got in touch to say they wouldn’t be progressing with my application”.</p><p>Alfie wonders if the studio might have simply been using them for some free art and production consultation. “They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games”, they say. “There are zero artists on their team”.</p><p>Alfie has since joined a new studio, which been experimenting with AI-generated imagery a few years back but abandoned its use entirely after finding the results neither accurate nor specific enough for in-game purposes. This studio changed course entirely, and Alfie’s hiring was part of a heavy investment in human art.</p><p>“I guess they realised that AI imagery can't solve all of your problems, and they realise just how precious real human artists are”, Alfie says. “A human artist will research the material properly, with all the nuances of human emotion and logic, and ultimately produce art assets that are historically accurate, game specific and have soul”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion...</p></blockquote></figure><p>is a voice actor whose jobs include recording lines for indie video games, and says their experiences discussing AI with potential employers \"feels like screaming into a void\". \"I've gotten through to small indie teams\", they say, \"and some publishers have been empathetic and understanding when I try steering them away from AI, since it hurts already-struggling independent artists and actors.

It has to do with the version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL) open source license that  2.x and 3.x were released under, with <a href=\"https://rsync.samba.org/GPL2.html\">rsync 2.x being released under the GPLv2 license</a> and <a href=\"https://rsync.samba.org/GPL.html\">rsync 3.x being released under the GPLv3 license</a>.

At its heart lies the XNU kernel – an\nacronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU is a unique  that combines a Mach microkernel core with components of BSD Unix.\nThis design inherits the rich legacy of Mach (originating from 1980s\nmicrokernel research) and the robust stability and POSIX compliance of BSD. The\nresult is a kernel architecture that balances modularity and performance by\nblending microkernel message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel\nstructure. We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s\nevolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in macOS on\nApple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep dive into the\narchitectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design (Mach-BSD interaction,\nIPC, scheduling, memory management, virtualization), and examine how the kernel\nand key user-space components have adapted to new devices and requirements over\ntime.</p><h2>Darwin and XNU Development History</h2><h3>Mach Microkernel Origins (1985–1996)</h3><p>Darwin’s story begins with , a project at Carnegie Mellon University\n(1985) led by Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian. Mach was envisioned as a\nnext-generation  to address the growing complexity of UNIX\nkernels. Instead of a single large kernel binary, Mach provided only\nfundamental low-level functions –  (virtual memory,\naddress spaces),  (threads and tasks), and <strong>inter-process\ncommunication</strong> (IPC via message passing). Higher-level services (file systems,\nnetworking, device drivers, etc.) were intended to run as user-space \non top of Mach. This separation promised improved reliability (a crashed driver\nwouldn’t crash the whole system) and flexibility (multiple OS personalities\ncould run concurrently). In fact, Mach’s design allowed running several\n“personalities” – for example, UNIX and another OS – on one microkernel, a\nconcept analogous to modern virtualization.</p><p>By 1990, Mach had progressed to , which was a microkernel but still\nco-located some BSD kernel code in kernel space for performance. The true\nmicrokernel version, , arrived in 1991–1994. Mach’s <strong>virtual\nmemory (VM) system</strong> was influential beyond the project – it was adopted by\n4.4BSD and later FreeBSD as their memory management subsystem. Importantly,\nMach introduced the concept of  (encapsulating an address space and\nresources, roughly equivalent to a process) and  (unit of CPU\nexecution) as first-class kernel objects. It also implemented an efficient VM\nwith copy-on-write and memory object abstractions, and a message-based IPC\nmechanism using .</p><p>Parallel to Mach’s development,  (founded by Steve Jobs in\n1985) needed a modern OS for its workstations. NeXT adopted Mach early:\n, released in 1989, was built on a Mach 2.5 kernel with a 4.3BSD\nUnix subsystem layered on top. Crucially, NeXTSTEP’s kernel (later named\n) was not a pure microkernel system with user-space servers; instead, it\ntook Mach and <strong>integrated the BSD code into the kernel address space</strong> for\nspeed. In other words, NeXT used Mach’s abstractions (tasks, threads, IPC, VM)\nand ran a BSD kernel  on top of Mach primitives. This hybrid\napproach sacrificed some of Mach’s extreme modularity in favor of performance:\nit avoided the heavy context-switching and messaging overhead that plagued\nfully microkernel systems of the era. NeXTSTEP’s kernel also included an\nobject-oriented driver framework called  (written in Objective-C)\nto develop device drivers as objects, reflecting NeXT’s preference for\nhigher-level languages.</p><p>By the mid-1990s, Apple’s original Mac OS (classic Mac OS) was aging and lacked\nmodern OS features like proper multitasking and memory protection. In 1996,\nApple sought an existing OS as its foundation for the future. The company\nacquired NeXT in December 1996, choosing NeXTSTEP as the core of the new . With this acquisition, NeXT’s Mach/BSD hybrid kernel came to Apple,\nbringing along the engineering leadership of Avie Tevanian (Mach co-author) as\nApple’s VP of Software. Apple named the new OS project , which\nwould later become Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X.</p><h3>Rhapsody to Mac OS X: Integrating Mach 3.0 and BSD (1997–2005)</h3><p>After acquiring NeXT, Apple set out to merge the NeXTSTEP kernel with\nadditional features and hardware support needed for Macs. The kernel was\nfurther updated with newer Mach and BSD technology. Notably, Apple incorporated\ncode from , the Open Software Foundation’s Mach 3.0 kernel, into\nXNU. This meant the Mach portion of XNU now drew from Mach 3.0’s true\nmicrokernel lineage (including contributions from University of Utah’s Mach 4\nresearch). On the BSD side, the NeXTSTEP kernel’s 4.3BSD subsystem was upgraded\nwith  code. This brought in a more modern BSD\nimplementation with features like improved networking and a robust filesystems\ninfrastructure. By combining Mach 3.0 and FreeBSD elements, Apple shaped XNU\ninto a powerful hybrid: Mach provided the low-level kernel architecture and\nabstractions, while BSD provided the  on top.</p><p>Apple also replaced NeXT’s old DriverKit with a new driver framework called\n, written in a subset of C++. I/O Kit introduced a object-oriented\ndevice driver model within the kernel, supporting features like dynamic device\nmatching and hot-plugging in a robust way. The choice of C++ (minus exceptions\nand multiple inheritance, using Embedded C++ subset) for I/O Kit was likely to\nimprove performance and avoid the runtime overhead of Objective-C in the\nkernel. By the late 1990s, XNU was thus composed of three core parts: the Mach\nmicrokernel layer (now OSFMK 7.3 based), the BSD layer (largely\nFreeBSD-derived), and the I/O Kit for drivers.</p><p>Apple delivered the first developer previews of Mac OS X in 1999, and in 2000\nreleased the open source Darwin 1.0, which exposed the XNU kernel and basic\nUnix userland to developers. The commercial debut, ,\ncame in early 2001 (Darwin 1.3.1). While the initial releases were rough in\nperformance, they cemented the architectural paradigm. Key early milestones\nincluded:</p><ul><li><strong>Mac OS X 10.1 (Puma, 2001)</strong> – Improved performance in threading and added\nmissing Unix features. Darwin 1.4.1 in 10.1 introduced faster thread\nmanagement and real-time threads support.</li><li><strong>Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar, 2002)</strong> – Darwin 6.0 brought the synchronicity of\nthe BSD layer with FreeBSD 4.4/5, plus large new features: IPv6 and IPSec\nnetworking, the new  service for discovery\n(Bonjour/Rendezvous), and journaling in HFS+ file system. It also upgraded\nthe toolchain (GCC3) and added modern Unix utilities.</li><li><strong>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther, 2003)</strong> – Darwin 7.0/7.1 integrated \nkernel improvements. This brought <strong>fine-grained kernel locking</strong> (moving\naway from the earlier giant-lock model) to better utilize multiprocessors.\nPanther’s kernel also introduced  (basic firewall) and\nother performance tuning like improved VM and I/O.</li></ul><p>Throughout these releases, XNU remained a 32-bit kernel (with limited 64-bit\nuser process support introduced in 10.4 for specific tasks). Apple maintained\nsupport for PowerPC the Mac CPU architecture of choice in the early days while\nalso quietly keeping the Intel x86 compatibility (inherited from NeXTSTEP’s x86\nsupport) in the source, preparing for future transitions.</p><p>A major architectural change arrived in <strong>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.4 (Tiger, 2005)</strong>. This\nwas the first version where Apple declared OS&nbsp;X to be ,\nmeaning the system conformed to the Single UNIX Specification and could legally\nuse the UNIX name. Darwin 8 (Tiger’s core) achieved this UNIX certification by\nvirtue of the robust BSD layer integrated in XNU. Tiger also introduced new\nkernel features like  (from FreeBSD, for scalable event\nhandling), and laid groundwork for Intel Macs by keeping XNU cross-platform.\nApple then announced in 2005 the switch to Intel x86 processors for Macs. XNU’s\nMach foundations made such platform adaptability easier, as Mach abstracted\nmany low-level hardware details behind a portability layer. In early 2006,\nApple released <strong>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.4.4 for Intel</strong>, demonstrating XNU running on\nx86_32 with much of the code shared with the PowerPC build.</p><h3>Transition to 64-bit, Multi-Core and iPhone OS (2005–2010)</h3><p>By the mid-2000s, computing had shifted to multi-core 64-bit architectures, and\nApple’s OS had to evolve accordingly. <strong>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.5 Leopard (2007)</strong>, based\non Darwin 9, was a landmark release for XNU. It introduced extensive 64-bit\nsupport: while earlier versions could run 64-bit user applications in limited\nform, Leopard’s kernel itself could run in 64-bit mode on appropriate hardware\n(x86-64) and support 64-bit drivers. Leopard also dropped official support for\nolder architectures like PowerPC G3 and brought in stronger security and\nperformance features: <strong>address space layout randomization (ASLR)</strong> to thwart\nexploits, an advanced  facility for restricting processes, and the\n instrumentation framework from Solaris for low-level tracing.\nNotably, Leopard was the last Mac OS X version to fully support PowerPC – Apple\nwas transitioning its entire lineup to Intel by this time.</p><p>In 2007, Apple also debuted the  with “iPhone OS” (later named iOS),\nwhich was built on Darwin as well. The first iPhone OS was based on Darwin 9\n(same core as Leopard). This demonstrated the versatility of XNU: within the\nsame kernel version, Apple could target high-end PowerPC and x86 servers,\nconsumer Intel laptops, and resource-constrained ARM mobile devices. The kernel\ngained support for the ARM architecture and tailor-made modifications for\nmobile. For example, because early iPhones had very limited RAM and no swap,\nthe kernel’s memory management had to incorporate aggressive . Apple introduced a  mechanism in iPhone OS, which\nmonitored low-memory conditions and killed background apps to free memory\n(since traditional swapping to disk was not feasible on flash storage). iPhone\nOS also ran all third-party apps in a  by design and required strict\ncode signing for binaries – security measures facilitated by XNU’s Mach and BSD\nlayers (Mach’s task port and codesign enforcement in the kernel, with help from\nuser-space daemons like  for signature validation).</p><p><strong>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.6 Snow Leopard (2009)</strong> marked the maturation of XNU on 64-bit\nIntel. Snow Leopard (Darwin 10) discontinued support for PowerPC entirely,\nmaking XNU a dual-architecture kernel (x86_64 and i386 for Intel Macs). It\nalso was the first to ship with an  fully 64-bit kernel on capable\nMacs (most defaulted to 32-bit kernel with 64-bit userland, except Xserve).\nSnow Leopard brought major concurrency advances: the introduction of <strong>Grand\nCentral Dispatch (libdispatch)</strong> for user-space task parallelization and kernel\nsupport for . While  is a user-space library,\nit works closely with the kernel, which provides the underlying thread pools\nand scheduling for dispatch queues. Another addition was  for GPU\ncomputing, again requiring tight integration between user frameworks and kernel\ndrivers. Snow Leopard’s streamlined focus on Intel and multi-core optimizations\nmade XNU more efficient.</p><p>On the mobile side,  and  (renamed “iOS”\nin 2010) evolved alongside, adding support for the Apple A4/A5 ARM chips and\nfeatures like multitasking. XNU’s scheduler was adapted in iOS 4 to handle the\nconcept of background apps with different priority bands (foreground,\nbackground, etc.), and to support  as they appeared\n(e.g., the Apple A5 in 2011 was dual-core). iOS and macOS kernels remained\nlargely unified, with conditional code for platform differences. By , XNU dropped support for 32-bit Intel kernels entirely – it\nrequired a 64-bit CPU on Mac, reflecting the industry’s move beyond 32-bit.\nLion (Darwin 11) also improved sandboxing and added full support for new\nfeatures like <strong>Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)</strong> in Obj-C (with compiler\nand runtime changes reflected in the system).</p><h3>Modern macOS and iOS Evolution (2011–2020)</h3><p>From 2011 onward, Apple’s OS releases came in a yearly cadence, and Darwin\ncontinued to get incremental but significant enhancements to support new\nhardware and features:</p><ul><li><strong>OS&nbsp;X 10.8 Mountain Lion (2012)</strong> and  (Darwin 12\nand 13) introduced power- and memory-optimizations in the kernel. Mavericks\nadded , a kernel feature where inactive pages are\ncompressed in RAM to avoid swapping to disk. This was in line with iOS\ntechniques to cope with low RAM, and it benefited Macs by improving\nresponsiveness under memory pressure. Mavericks also implemented , where the kernel aligns wake-ups from idle to reduce CPU power\nusage. These changes show how the kernel adapted to energy-efficiency\ndemands, influenced by mobile design philosophies. Additionally, around this\ntime, Apple introduced  and increased use of Quality-of-Service\n(QoS) classes for threads, which required kernel scheduling awareness to\nthrottle or prioritize threads based on QoS hints (e.g., background vs\nuser-initiated tasks). XNU’s scheduler evolved to support these multiple\npriority bands and energy-efficient scheduling.</li><li><strong>OS&nbsp;X 10.10 Yosemite (2014)</strong> and  (Darwin 14 and\n15) continued the trend. A major security addition in El Capitan was <strong>System\nIntegrity Protection (SIP)</strong>. SIP (also called “rootless”) is enforced by the\nkernel’s security framework, preventing even root user processes from\ntampering with critical system files and processes. Implemented via the BSD\nlayer’s Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework, SIP hardened the OS by\nmoving more trust into the kernel and away from user space. For iOS (iOS 9 in\n2015), similar “rootless” concepts were applied. Darwin 15 also saw Apple\nunifying the code base for OS X and iOS further, as they introduced\n and  (both also Darwin-based) – XNU had to accommodate\nrunning on tiny Apple Watch hardware (S1 chip) up to powerful Mac Pros, with\nscalable scheduling, memory, and I/O capabilities. By now, XNU supported\nARM64 (64-bit ARMv8, first used in iPhone 5s in 2013) and would go on to drop\n32-bit ARM support for iOS by .</li><li><strong>macOS 10.12 Sierra (2016)</strong>, ,  (Darwin 16–18) brought filesystem evolution and further security.\nHigh Sierra introduced  as the new default\nfilesystem, replacing HFS+. APFS required kernel support for snapshots,\ncloning, and encryption at the container level. XNU’s VFS layer (in the BSD\ncomponent) was extended to accommodate APFS’s advanced features and\nperformance characteristics. During this era, kext (kernel extension)\nsecurity was tightened – macOS High Sierra requires user approval for loading\nthird-party kexts, and macOS Mojave introduced stricter code signing checks\nand hardened runtime for user-space processes that also influence how the\nkernel validates and allows certain operations. Another adaptation was\ngraphics and external device support, High Sierra’s eGPU support via\nThunderbolt required hot-plug handling improvements in I/O Kit and scheduling\nof external PCIe devices.</li><li><strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina (2019)</strong> (Darwin 19) was a significant modernization\nstep for XNU. Catalina was the first to <strong>deprecate most 32-bit code</strong> (only\n64-bit apps, and the kernel had been 64-bit only for years already). More\nnotably, Apple introduced a new approach for device drivers: ,\nreviving the name of NeXT’s old driver framework but with a new design.\nDriverKit in modern macOS allows many drivers to run in user space as\n<strong>Driver Extensions (dexts)</strong>, outside of the kernel. This is a shift towards\nmicrokernel philosophy for third-party code – by moving drivers (USB,\nnetwork, etc.) to user-space processes, Apple improved system stability and\nsecurity (a buggy driver can’t crash the kernel if it’s outside it). XNU was\nadapted to facilitate this: the kernel provides user-space drivers with\ncontrolled access to hardware (via IPC and shared memory) instead of loading\ntheir code as kexts. At the same time, Catalina split the OS filesystem into\na read-only system volume, reinforcing the kernel’s SIP protections (the\nkernel now treats system files as immutable during runtime). These changes\nshow how even decades after its birth, XNU’s architecture can pivot to\nincorporate more user-space responsibilities when beneficial, leveraging the\nMach IPC mechanisms to do so safely.</li></ul><h3>Apple Silicon Era (2020–Present)</h3><p>In 2020, Apple undertook another monumental transition: moving the Mac lineup\nfrom Intel CPUs to Apple’s custom  (the  chips,\nstarting with M1). Darwin had long supported ARM due to iOS, but running macOS\non ARM64 introduced new challenges and opportunities. , corresponding to Darwin 20, was the first release for Apple Silicon\nMacs. XNU was already cross-platform, but it now had to support a heterogeneous\n<strong>big.LITTLE CPU architecture</strong>: Apple Silicon chips combine high-performance\ncores and energy-efficient cores. The scheduler was enhanced to be\n, ensuring high-priority and heavy threads run on\nperformance cores, while background and low-QoS threads can be scheduled on\nefficiency cores to save power. Apple likely utilizes the thread  (which had been introduced in earlier macOS/iOS) to map threads to\nappropriate core types – this is an extension of Mach scheduling concepts to a\nnew domain of asymmetric multiprocessing.</p><p>Another aspect of Apple Silicon is the unified memory architecture (shared\nmemory between CPU/GPU). While largely abstracted by frameworks, the kernel’s\nmemory manager works with the GPU drivers (which are now Apple’s own,\nintegrated via I/O Kit) to manage buffer sharing without expensive copies. The\nMach VM abstraction fits well here – memory objects can be shared between\nuser-space and the GPU with VM remapping rather than duplication. Additionally,\nApple Silicon brought hardware features like <strong>Pointer Authentication (PAC)</strong>\nand <strong>Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)</strong> for security. XNU’s ARM64 backend had to\nsupport PAC (which it does by using PAC keys in exception frames and system\npointers to mitigate ROP attacks) and potentially MTE to detect memory\nerrors – these are deep architecture-specific enhancements in the kernel to\nimprove security on new hardware.</p><p>On the virtualization front, Apple Silicon prompted a reevaluation of\nvirtualization strategy. On Intel Macs, XNU has long supported virtualization\nvia the  (introduced in macOS 10.10 Yosemite) which\nallows user-space programs to run VMs using hardware VT-x support. With Apple\nSilicon, macOS 11 introduced a new  built on top of\nan in-kernel hypervisor for ARM64 (taking advantage of the ARM VMM features).\nNotably, while the  code does not include the Apple Silicon\nhypervisor, the shipped kernel does initialize hypervisor support if running on\nthe appropriate Apple chip. This allows macOS on M1/M2 to run lightweight\nvirtual machines (for Linux, macOS guests, etc.) entirely from user-space\ncontrollers, similar to Linux KVM. On iOS devices, Apple has kept the\nhypervisor disabled or restricted (no public API), but the hardware capability\nappeared with A14 chips. Enthusiasts quickly found that on jailbroken A14\ndevices, the hypervisor could be enabled to run Linux VMs.</p><p>Beyond CPU and virtualization, Apple Silicon Macs run many of the same daemons\nand services as iOS, indicating a convergence in system architecture. The XNU\nkernel now powers everything from servers (macOS), personal computers, phones,\nwatches, TVs, and even the  (a variant of Darwin running on the\nApple T2/M1 auxiliary processors for device management). Darwin’s <strong>flexibility\nand scalability</strong> stem from the Mach foundation: it abstracts hardware\nspecifics in a platform layer, so adding a new CPU architecture (PowerPC → x86\n→ ARM64) or scaling down to limited hardware largely requires implementing the\nMach low-level interfaces (like pmap for MMU, thread context switches, etc.)\nand leaving higher-level kernel logic untouched. This design has paid dividends\nin Apple’s transitions.</p><p>In summary, over two decades, XNU has undergone major transformations while\nretaining its core identity.  highlights a timeline of Darwin/XNU\nmilestones and architectural changes:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NeXTSTEP 1.0 (Mach 2.5 + 4.3BSD)</td><td>NeXT’s XNU kernel hybrid introduced: Mach microkernel with BSD in kernel space for performance.

(2024, December 29). . Retrieved 22:59, April 3, 2025 from\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Diagram_of_Mac_OS_X_architecture.svg&amp;oldid=976998015\">https://commons.wikimedia.org</a>.</p></blockquote><h3>Hybrid Kernel Design: Mach + BSD Integration</h3><p>XNU’s kernel design is often described as a , because it\nmerges characteristics of microkernels (Mach) and monolithic kernels (BSD). In\na traditional microkernel, the kernel provides minimal services (IPC,\nscheduling, VM) and everything else runs as user-space servers. In a monolithic\nUNIX kernel, all OS services run in kernel mode as one large program. XNU\nattempts to get “the best of both”: it uses Mach to modularize and abstract\nlow-level functions, but co-locates the critical BSD services in kernel space\nfor efficiency.</p><p>In XNU, the Mach component and the BSD component <strong>run as a single kernel\nentity</strong> – they are linked into one binary and share the same address space.\nThere is no Mach vs BSD protection boundary; Mach functions and BSD functions\ncall each other via normal function calls within the kernel, not via IPC\nmessages. This co-location avoids the significant context-switch overhead that\na pure Mach system would incur (where a Unix system call would require\nmessaging a user-space BSD server). As a result, standard UNIX system calls\n(file I/O, socket operations, etc.) in XNU perform comparably to other\nmonolithic Unix kernels, since the BSD code executes directly in kernel mode.\nFor instance, when a process calls , it traps into the kernel and the\nBSD file system code is invoked directly; there’s no Mach message to a separate\nprocess as would happen in a Mach 3.0 microkernel with an external BSD server.</p><p> Mach in XNU provides the core kernel <strong>infrastructure and\nabstractions</strong>. Mach manages CPU  and task address spaces, implements\nlow-level scheduling, and handles virtual memory management (memory mapping,\npaging). It also provides the fundamental  – Mach messages\nsent over Mach  (communication endpoints). In XNU, every process (BSD\nprocess) is backed by a Mach  and every thread by a Mach thread. The\nMach layer is responsible for creating and terminating tasks/threads, context\nswitching threads on the CPU, and implementing primitives like locks, timers,\nand scheduling queues. It also implements the VM system: each task has a\nvirtual address map, memory regions are backed by Mach , and\nMach can perform copy-on-write copy optimizations and map propagation. Notably,\nMach supports  – one task can send a memory object\n(or a port right to it) to another, enabling efficient shared memory or\ntransfer of large buffers without copying.</p><p> The BSD component sits logically “on top” of Mach and provides\nthe traditional  and services. This includes managing\n (the BSD process table, PID allocation, user IDs, signals, etc.),\n (which are mapped to Mach threads), and the entire set of\nUNIX system calls (file systems, networking, IPC, device I/O, etc.). The BSD\nkernel in XNU is derived primarily from FreeBSD (with substantial\nOpenBSD/NetBSD influences and custom Apple modifications). It handles things\nlike:</p><ul><li> XNU’s BSD layer implements a VFS (Virtual File\nSystem) and supports many file systems (HFS+, APFS, NFS, etc.). The file\nsystem code runs in the kernel and interacts with storage drivers via I/O\nKit. Mach VM and BSD file systems meet when implementing memory-mapped files\n– Mach calls into BSD to fetch pages from files on disk (via the vnode\npager).</li><li> The entire TCP/IP stack (and other protocols like UDP,\nICMP, as well as higher-level sockets API) is in the BSD kernel. This code\ncame from BSD and is updated with modern standards. It interfaces with\nnetwork drivers (in I/O Kit) for packet send/receive.</li><li> Besides Mach IPC, XNU provides traditional Unix IPC (signals,\npipes, SysV IPC, POSIX message queues, etc.) through the BSD layer. Signals,\nfor example, are implemented by the BSD kernel, but interestingly signals are\ndelivered using Mach exceptions under the hood – Mach exceptions are the\nlow-level mechanism, and the BSD code translates them to Unix signals for\nprocesses as needed.</li><li><strong>Security and Credentials:</strong> The BSD layer manages user IDs, permissions,\naccess control, and integrates several security frameworks. For instance,\n (Kernel Authorization) and the MAC Framework (Mandatory Access\nControl) operate in the BSD layer. Features like the Sandbox, SIP, code\nsigning enforcement involve cooperation between BSD security modules and Mach\ntask port restrictions. The sandbox (Seatbelt) in macOS/iOS uses the\nTrustedBSD MAC framework – when a system call is made, the MAC policy can vet\nit. This happens in the BSD layer, though the sandbox’s configuration is set\nfrom user space by launchd or other daemons.</li><li><strong>POSIX APIs and Environment:</strong> The BSD layer is what makes Darwin a UNIX. It\nprovides  management (which often links to I/O Kit devices), system\ncall table for standard C library calls, process forking ( is\nimplemented partly by Mach (VM copy-on-write) and partly by BSD (duplicating\nfile descriptors, etc.), and execve (loading binaries, setting up Mach task\nstates and BSD process states).</li></ul><p>In essence, one can think of Mach as the  in XNU, and\nBSD as a high-level kernel server that depends on Mach. The two are tightly\ncoupled – e.g., when a new BSD process is created via , the kernel\ninternally calls Mach to create a new task and thread, then BSD code populates\nthe process structure and file descriptors. The BSD code calls Mach kernel\nfunctions directly (not via message) using an internal API. Conversely, Mach\nrelies on some BSD services; for example, Mach has an abstraction called\n“default pager” for managing swap. In XNU, the default pager is implemented\npartly in user space (the  daemon) which uses Mach VM APIs to\ncreate and manage swap files, but the BSD layer is involved in the actual file\nI/O to the swap file. This shows a cooperative multi-tier design rather than\nstrictly separated layers.</p><p> The third pillar of XNU is the , Apple’s\nobject-oriented driver framework. I/O Kit runs in kernel space (as part of the\nXNU kernel), but it is written in a restricted form of C++ for type-safety and\ncode reuse. The I/O Kit defines a class hierarchy for devices (buses, storage,\nnetwork, display, etc.) and drivers subclass these to implement support for\nspecific hardware. Drivers in I/O Kit live as C++ objects within the kernel,\nbut they interact with user space through well-defined interfaces. For\ninstance, an I/O Kit driver can publish properties accessible via the I/O\nRegistry, and can provide  interfaces that allow user-space\napplications or daemons to call into the driver in a controlled way. I/O Kit\nalso supports limited  historically (via user clients),\nbut in practice, until recent DriverKit, most drivers ran in kernel. The Mach\ncomponent provides threading and synchronization primitives used by I/O Kit\n(like locks and workloops), while the BSD component interacts with I/O Kit for\nnetworking and disk I/O (e.g., the BSD filesystem code calls an I/O Kit disk\ndriver to read a block). The decision to use C++ in kernel (contrary to the\n“not written in C++” myth; the core kernel logic is C, but drivers are C++\nclasses) was made to improve extensibility. By eliminating multiple inheritance\nand exceptions, Apple ensured the kernel would not suffer C++ runtime overhead.\nMany drivers can be loaded and unloaded dynamically as  (kernel\nextensions), which are essentially loadable bundles of I/O Kit C++ classes or\nadditional BSD/Mach code. XNU’s modularity in this sense is reminiscent of\nother OS kernels that allow loadable modules, but Mach’s abstractions also help\nhere (each kext is essentially a Mach-O image loaded into kernel memory and\nlinked).</p><p><strong>Mach IPC and Message Passing:</strong> Even though XNU does not use Mach messages\nfor Unix , Mach IPC is still heavily used throughout the system\nfor what we might call “RPC”-style interactions and for connecting\nuser-space services to kernel or to each other. Mach ports are the\nfoundation of various high-level features:</p><ul><li>Many kernel abstractions are represented as Mach ports to user space. For\nexample, each task (process) has a Mach port (the task port) that represents\nits control handle. The kernel holds the rights, but certain privileged tasks\n(like  or debugging tools) can obtain send rights to manipulate\nother tasks (to start/stop them, inspect memory, etc.).</li><li>Mach  are used for event delivery. The WindowServer\n(graphics system) receives user input events from the kernel via Mach\nmessages. Likewise, higher-level APIs like Grand Central Dispatch under the\nhood use Mach ports to sleep threads waiting for events, leveraging Mach’s\nport-set and message mechanism. The  mechanism in BSD is\nintegrated: an event queue can wait on Mach port messages as well as file\ndescriptors, unifying the event sources.</li><li><strong>Inter-process Communication</strong> for system services: Apple’s entire \nframework (used by modern macOS/iOS for lightweight IPC between apps and\nservices) is built on Mach messages. Each XPC connection is essentially a\nMach port behind the scenes. The reason Mach IPC is chosen is its security\nmodel – Mach ports have an associated rights system and live in the kernel,\nso the kernel mediates who can send to whom. This allows checks like “is the\nsender task entitled to send this message?” which is used in services like\nthe Keychain (securityd) to validate callers. Mach messages also support\ncarrying out-of-line memory (shared memory regions) and port rights, which is\nextremely powerful for building higher-level RPC: you can send a file\ndescriptor (which is a BSD concept) as a Mach port right in a message,\nenabling UNIX domain socket semantics via Mach. Under the hood, the file\ndescriptor send uses a Mach port representing that file in the receiving\ntask’s space.</li><li> Mach introduced MIG (Mach Interface Generator),\nwhich is used to define interfaces where one side is in kernel and the other\nin user. For example, the bootstrap server (launchd) and various system\nservers use MIG to auto-generate code for sending/receiving messages. The\nmacOS  system (for system-wide notifications) and many daemon APIs\nare implemented with MIG definitions.</li></ul><p>Therefore, Mach IPC is a backbone for the macOS/iOS architecture beyond the\nkernel boundary. It’s how user-space components talk to each other and to the\nkernel in many cases. Even certain device drivers use Mach port notifications\n(e.g., I/O Kit user clients might deliver an asynchronous event to a client via\na Mach message). The hybrid kernel thus uses Mach messaging where appropriate\n(for asynchronous, out-of-band communication), and uses direct function calls\nfor in-kernel interactions. This hybrid approach retains Mach’s \nbenefits – for instance, one can imagine refactoring a component to run in\nuser space with Mach messages without changing the other parts, since they\nmight already use a Mach port interface to talk to it. In fact, Apple did\nexactly this with DriverKit: they moved certain drivers to user space and\nreplaced their in-kernel part with a Mach IPC conduit. The\nperformance-critical path (e.g., actual packet sending) might still be in\nkernel, but higher-level policy or USB logic can be in a user process\ncommunicating via Mach.</p><h3>Scheduler and Thread Management</h3><p>XNU’s scheduling is rooted in Mach’s scheduler, which was originally a\npriority-based round-robin scheduler with support for threads and processor\nsets. Over time, Apple has modified the scheduler significantly to meet the\nneeds of desktop and mobile. The scheduler manages threads (Mach threads)\nacross CPU cores (XNU supports SMP and on Apple Silicon, asymmetric cores). Key\npoints of XNU scheduling:</p><ul><li> Mach defines a range of thread priorities (0–127,\nhistorically) with certain bands reserved for real-time, kernel, and normal\nthreads. Apple uses these priorities along with abstractions called\n and  for each thread. Time-sharing threads have\npriorities that can float based on usage (to implement favoring I/O-bound\nthreads), whereas real-time threads have fixed priorities. The highest\npriorities are for critical kernel threads or timers.</li><li> In classic Mach, each processor or processor-set had a run\nqueue for threads. XNU has per-CPU run queues for efficiency. It also has\nmechanisms for  to load-balance or preempt when\nnecessary.</li><li> Apple added features like <strong>container-level\nprioritization</strong>. When iOS introduced App Sandbox with backgrounding, the\nscheduler got a concept of a “task role” or “priority group”. In Darwin 9\n(Leopard/iPhone OS), an “improved hierarchical process scheduling model” was\nnoted, which suggests that threads were grouped by tasks or by “workload”,\npossibly to enforce limits on background tasks. This is likely the origin of\n that iOS uses to ensure the foreground app gets more\nCPU than background apps.</li><li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong> In iOS 8 / OS X 10.10 and beyond, Apple\nintroduced QoS classes (user-interactive, user-initiated, default, utility,\nbackground, etc.) for threads. The kernel scheduler integrates QoS by mapping\nthem to priority bands and scheduling deadlines. Threads created by Grand\nCentral Dispatch or NSThreads inherit a QoS that influences their scheduling\npriority and which core they run on. This was further refined on Apple\nSilicon where the scheduler might steer “background QoS” threads to\nefficiency cores. Internally, XNU’s  and  (for\nperformance controller) handle these decisions. There is also an interface\nfor the kernel to ask the power management firmware about energy vs\nperformance (used in macOS’s power management QoS).</li><li> macOS supports realtime threads for audio or\ncritical tasks. The scheduler has a realtime queue and will preempt other\nwork to run RT threads to meet latency requirements. Also, since Mac OS X\n10.4, XNU has  for real-time threads (used for audio\nplayback, etc.), which is an EDF-like (Earliest deadline first) feature.</li><li> On mobile devices, the scheduler cooperates with the\npower management to aggressively idle cores. Mach scheduler invokes an idle\nthread when no work is available, and in iOS, if all cores are idle, the\nsystem can enter low-power states quickly. Timer coalescing (10.9 Mavericks)\nmeans the scheduler tries to batch wakeups – effectively, if several threads\nhave timers expiring, it aligns them to let CPU sleep longer intervals.</li></ul><p>Overall, XNU’s scheduler has evolved from Mach’s general-purpose design to one\naware of  and  cores, \ntrade-offs, and  (like apps vs system daemons vs kernel\nthreads). It still uses Mach’s thread data structures, but many scheduling\nalgorithms have been tuned by Apple (sometimes influenced by developments in\nFreeBSD or other OSes).</p><h3>Memory Management and Virtual Memory</h3><p>Memory management in XNU is primarily handled by Mach’s VM subsystem, which is\none of Mach’s strongest components. Key aspects:</p><ul><li> Each Mach task has a virtual address space\nrepresented by a set of  and . When a process (task)\nis created, it starts with a copy of the parent’s address space. Mach’s VM is\ninherently copy-on-write –  doesn’t duplicate all memory immediately;\ninstead, both parent and child share pages marked copy-on-write until either\nwrites, then a fault triggers an actual copy. This makes  efficient\ndespite potentially large processes.</li><li><strong>Memory Objects and Pagers:</strong> Mach introduces the concept of  to represent a backing store for memory (like a file or the swap\narea) and  which supply data to those memory objects on demand. In\nXNU, the  (for anonymous memory) is implemented by the\n user-space daemon which manages swap files. That is, when the\nkernel decides to evict a page from RAM, Mach will send a message to the\ndefault pager indicating the page should be written to swap. The\n then writes to the swap file (via normal file I/O). This is a\nclassic microkernel design: the , meaning the\npolicy of how to manage swap space is not fixed in kernel. By adjusting or\nreplacing dynamic_pager, one could change swapping behavior (e.g., macOS’s\ndynamic_pager can create multiple swap files on demand). File memory is\nmanaged by a different pager: the  inside the kernel (this one\nis not user-space, but part of XNU’s BSD layer) which interacts with file\nsystem code to read/write file data for memory mapped files. Having this\nmodular pager design made features like  feasible to\nimplement – in Mavericks, an in-kernel compression pager was added: when\npressure is high, instead of immediately paging to disk, XNU can compress\ninactive pages and keep them in a reserved VM object (the “compressor pool”)\nin RAM. The VM considers that as a form of pseudo-swapping (faster than\ndisk). Only if compression is insufficient does it resort to disk swap via\ndynamic_pager.</li><li><strong>Physical Memory Management:</strong> XNU abstracts physical memory operations in a\nmachine-dependent layer called  (physical map). The pmap manages page\ntables or equivalent structures on each architecture. When Mach allocates a\nnew VM region, it uses pmap to map virtual pages to physical frames. On\nARM64, pmap also integrates with security features (like marking pages with\nthe appropriate permission keys for PAC, or handling aliasing issues with\ncaches). The kernel uses a  for many kernel memory\nstructures (zones are pools for objects of fixed size, like VM map entries,\nIPC port structures, etc.). There’s also a general-purpose \n(kmem) for variable sizes. Notably, the XNU kernel employs strategies to\nmitigate fragmentation and has guard pages for certain allocations to detect\noverruns (on debug kernels, typically).</li><li><strong>Shared Memory and Map Inheritance:</strong> Mach VM allows tasks to share regions\n– either explicitly via Mach IPC (sending a port for a memory object) or via\ninheritance (a child can inherit memory from parent on fork with\ncopy-on-write or shared semantics). This is how the dynamic linker works in\nmacOS: the shared cache of frameworks is mapped into every process at launch\nvia a shared memory region provided by . Mach makes this efficient by\nmapping the same physical pages into all tasks read-only.</li><li> The kernel itself has a virtual address space.\nMach manages kernel memory similarly to user memory, but there are\ndifferences: the kernel uses a single map for all of kernel space, and some\nregions are wired (non-pageable). XNU historically had a 32-bit kernel for\nwhich it used tricky schemes like a shared address space with user processes\n(in early OS X on 32-bit, kernel and user shared space to avoid costly\nsegment switches, but on 64-bit this was not an issue). Modern XNU (64-bit)\nuses a separate address space for kernel, with portions (like the shared\ncache, comm page) mapped into user for communication.</li><li> Mach’s design enforces that one task cannot access\nanother task’s memory unless explicitly allowed. This is basic memory\nprotection via separate address spaces. The only controlled sharing is via\nMach VM APIs or if the kernel (or a privileged daemon) maps memory into\nanother task (used by things like the debugger or by the system frameworks to\nimplement features like XPC shared memory). The kernel also zero-fills memory\non allocation to avoid leakage between processes.</li><li><strong>Evolution for Apple Silicon:</strong> On Apple Silicon, with large physical memory\nand unified memory, XNU’s VM had to consider not having distinct GPU memory.\nInstead, I/O Kit drivers for GPU allocate from general memory with certain\nattributes (e.g., contiguous, protected). The pmap might have optimizations\nfor the extremely large virtual address space (ARMv8.5 supports 52-bit VA).\nAlso, memory tagging (MTE) if used would mean the kernel must manage tag\nbits in pointers and memory; Apple hasn’t announced using it, but the\nhardware is there on M2. If enabled, the kernel would tag allocations and\ncheck tags on load/store, catching use-after-free or overflow.</li></ul><p>XNU’s VM is regarded as quite advanced due to its Mach heritage – it was built\nfor 64-bit from the start (Mach had 64-bit addressing on 32-bit hardware via\nabstractions), and it’s relatively decoupled from the rest of kernel logic,\nwhich is why Apple could plug in new features (compressor, different\npagers) without massive overhaul.</p><p>While Mach’s original vision could be seen as a form of virtualization\n(multiple OS personalities on one kernel), modern hardware virtualization is a\ndifferent beast. XNU did not originally include a hypervisor in early releases,\nbut as virtualization became important, Apple added support. On ,\nXNU gained the ability to manage the hardware virtualization extensions (Intel\nVT-x) around 2014. Apple provided a  API to developers\nfrom OS&nbsp;X 10.10 onward, enabling user-space virtualization without third-party\nkernel extensions. Under the hood, a kernel extension (or part of XNU) would\nconfigure VMX operations, allowing a user-space process to act as a virtual\nmachine monitor. This was used by tools like  (a port of FreeBSD’s\nbhyve to macOS), and by virtualization apps when running without their own\ndrivers.</p><p>On , the approach is similar conceptually: XNU on\nthese devices can act as a Type-2 hypervisor using ARM’s virtualization\nextensions (EL2 on ARM). Apple introduced a more full-featured\n in macOS 11, which builds on an in-kernel\nhypervisor to let developers run Linux or even macOS VMs in user space. One\ndesign decision on Apple Silicon was to not allow arbitrary third-party\nhypervisors in kernel; instead, the hypervisor is part of XNU but only\naccessible via Apple’s frameworks with proper entitlements (to maintain\nsecurity).</p><p>From a kernel perspective, the XNU hypervisor functionality includes: managing\n, handling  for sensitive\ninstructions, and exposing virtual CPU interfaces to user space (for instance,\nallowing a user program to set register state and run a vCPU until the next VM\nexit). The Mach scheduling is leveraged to schedule vCPUs (which are just\nthreads from the host’s point of view). The memory subsystem is used to map\nguest memory. On Apple Silicon, features like Stage 2 page tables for guests\nare managed likely by an in-kernel hypervisor module.</p><p>Additionally, XNU supports containers and emulation in various ways (not full\nvirtualization but worth noting): the <strong>XNU kernel supports multiple user-space\n“personalities”</strong> only in a limited sense now (for example, the Rosetta 2\nx86_64 code translator on ARM is not a separate OS but it does require the\nkernel to manage alternate CPU context for x86 state). The kernel includes an\n or at least support for handling x86 code segmentation, etc.,\nwhen Rosetta translates x86 code to ARM64 – primarily done in user space by\nRosetta’s JIT, the kernel might assist e.g. with syscall translation or by\nproviding an x86_64 syscall ABI on ARM.</p><p>The design choices around virtualization emphasize security and performance:\nApple’s approach is to keep the hypervisor simple and lean and to strongly\nisolate guest OSes from the host (different Mach task, limited communication).\nAs of iOS 15, Apple even allows  (to run Linux inside\nan iPad app, for example, which some developers have demoed), indicating the\nXNU hypervisor is capable on mobile as well, though subject to entitlement.</p><p>In summary, virtualization in XNU spans from the conceptual Mach\nmulti-personality support (not widely used in products outside early Classic\nenvironment on OS&nbsp;X which ran Mac OS 9 in a para-virtualized setup), to robust\nhardware-assisted virtualization on modern Macs.</p><p>MacOS uses two complementary but distinct isolation mechanisms— and the more recently introduced —to protect sensitive\noperations and data.</p><p>The  is a dedicated, hardened subsystem integrated into\nApple’s SoCs (found in iPhones, iPads, Macs with T2 or Apple Silicon, etc.). It\nruns its own microkernel‐based operating system (historically a variant of L4\ncalled sepOS) and is used to manage and protect cryptographic keys, biometric\ndata, and other sensitive information. Its design isolates critical data even\nif the main application processor or kernel is compromised. In short, it’s a\n“trusted box” built into the hardware that handles security‑critical tasks\nindependently.</p><p>, by contrast, are a newer security innovation (first appearing in\nmacOS 14.4 and iOS 17) that further subdivide the operating system’s\nprivileges. Instead of having all sensitive operations run in the same\nprivileged domain as the main XNU kernel, Apple is now isolating key resources\ninto separate, “externally located” domains. These resources—such as Apple ID\nservices for virtual machines, audio buffers, sensor data, and even components\nthat manage indicator lights—are pre‑configured at boot and are managed by\nspecialized kernel extensions (e.g., ExclaveKextClient.kext,\nExclaveSEPManagerProxy.kext, and ExclavesAudioKext.kext) along with private\nframeworks.</p><p>In geographical terms, an enclave is a territory entirely enclosed within\nanother, which aptly describes the Secure Enclave’s containment within the SoC.\nAn exclave, on the other hand, is a fragment that is separated from the main\nterritory yet still associated with it—mirroring how these isolated resources\nexist outside the main XNU kernel while remaining tightly integrated with the\noverall system. This separation means that even if the main kernel is\ncompromised, the operations running in exclaves remain insulated, offering\nadditional defense in depth.</p><p>Darwin and XNU offer a fascinating case study of an operating system that is\n<em>neither fully microkernel nor monolithic</em>, but a judicious mix. Its evolution\nillustrates trade-offs in OS design: performance vs. modularity, generality vs.\nspecialization. XNU’s Mach-based core, once considered a performance liability,\nhas proven to be a strength in adapting to new architectures and enabling\nsystem-wide features (like seamless multi-OS integration on Apple Silicon, or\nfine-grained sandboxing). Meanwhile, the BSD layer ensured that developers and\napplications have a rich, POSIX-compliant environment, with all the expected\nUNIX tools and APIs, greatly smoothing the adoption and software portability\nfor the platform.</p><p>In the modern era, as hardware trends move towards specialized processors and\nincreased parallelism, XNU continues to incorporate new techniques (e.g.,\ndispatch queues, QoS scheduling, and direct support for machine learning\naccelerators through drivers) while maintaining robustness. The Darwin OS,\nthrough open source releases, also provides researchers a window into a\ncommercial-grade hybrid kernel (albeit not a very good window), inspiring\nefforts in OS architecture that blend ideas from both camps of the classic\nmicrokernel debate.</p><p>Apple’s Darwin has thus grown from a niche NeXTSTEP OS to the core of millions\nof devices, all the while <strong>tracing a line of continuity back to Mach and\nBSD</strong>. Each major transition – be it new CPU architectures (PowerPC→Intel→ARM),\nnew device categories, or new security paradigms – has been met by XNU with an\narchitectural answer:  (not rewrite) the kernel,  components\ntightly when needed, and  through Mach IPC when possible. This\nbalanced evolution of Darwin’s kernel showcases a successful long-term OS\ndesign, one that remains at the forefront of commercial operating systems while\nrooted in decades of operating systems research.</p>","contentLength":51302,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597778"},{"title":"Rules for Negotiating a Job Offer (2016)","url":"https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/","date":1743887700,"author":"rzk","guid":22343,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When <a href=\"https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/\">the story of how I landed a job at Airbnb</a> went viral, I was surprised at how infatuated people were with my negotiations. Media stories portrayed me as some kind of master negotiator—a wily ex-poker-player who was able to con the tech giants into a lucrative job offer.</p><p>This is silly. It’s silly for a lot of reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, my negotiation skills are nothing special. There are lots of job candidates who are better negotiators than I, to speak nothing of recruiters and other professional negotiators.</p><p>It just so happens that most people don’t negotiate at all, or if they do, they just negotiate just enough to satisfy themselves that they did.</p><p>Worse yet, most of the advice out there on negotiation is borderline useless. Almost anything you read on the subject will be a vague and long-winded exhortation to “make sure you negotiate” and “never say the first number.” Beyond those two morsels of advice, you’re pretty much on your own.</p><p>I thought to myself: why is there so little actionable advice out there about negotiation? I suspect it’s because deep down, many people believe that negotiation is inexplicable, that it’s something some people can do and others can’t, and that there’s no real way to break it down so anyone can learn it.</p><p>I say that’s bullshit. Negotiation is a skill that can be learned just like any other, and I don’t believe it’s particularly elusive or hard to understand. So I’m going to try to explain how anyone can do it.</p><p>First: I’m not an expert. There are people who really are experts at this, and when my advice contradicts theirs, you should assume I’m wrong.</p><p>Second: negotiation is tricky to generalize about because it’s deeply intertwined with social dynamics and power. The appropriate advice for an Asian male in Silicon Valley may not be appropriate for a black woman in Birmingham, Alabama. Racial, sexual, and political dynamics accompany you to the negotiating table.</p><p>At the same time, I want to caution against overemphasizing these factors. Being afraid to negotiate out of fear of discrimination can often be just as deleterious as discrimination itself.</p><p>Ceteris paribus, negotiate aggressively.</p><p>Third: I’m the first to admit that negotiation is stupid. It’s a practice that inherently benefits those who are good at it, and is an absurd axis on which to reward people. But it’s a reality of our economic system. And like most collective action problems, we’re probably not going to be able to abolish it any time soon. In which case, you might as well improve at it.</p><p>So here’s my guide to negotiation. It’s going to be split into two parts: this first part will be about conceptualizing the negotiating process, about how to begin the process and set yourself up for maximal success. The second part will be advice on the actual back-and-forth portion of negotiating and how to ask for what you want.</p><p>Let’s take it from the top.</p><h2>What it means to “get a job”</h2><p>In our culture we call entering the employment market “trying to get a job.” This is an unfortunate turn of phrase. “Getting a job” implies that jobs are a resource out in the world, and you’re attempting to secure one of these resources. But that’s completely backwards. What you are actually doing is selling your labor, and a company is bidding for it.</p><p><strong>Employment is just striking a mutual deal in the labor market.</strong></p><p>Like any market, the labor market only functions well if it’s competitive. This is the only way to ensure fair and equitable pricing. Imagine you were a farmer selling watermelons. Would you just sell your watermelons to the first buyer who agreed to purchase them? Or would you survey the marketplace of buyers, see the best price (and business partner) you could get, and then make an informed decision on which buyer to sell to?</p><p>And yet, when people talk about the labor market, they think “oh, a company wants to ! What a relief!” As though having a job were in itself some special privilege for which a company is the gatekeeper.</p><p>Dispel yourself of this mindset.</p><p>A job is just a deal. It is a deal between you and a company to exchange labor for money (and other things you value).</p><p>This might sound like an abstract point, but you should absolutely approach negotiation from this perspective.</p><p>Negotiating is a natural and expected part of the process of trying to make a deal. It’s also a signal of competence and seriousness. Companies generally respect candidates who negotiate, and most highly attractive candidates negotiate (if for no other reason, because they often have too many options to choose from).</p><p>At the risk of spouting truisms: always, always negotiate. Doesn’t matter how good or bad you think you are. You never damage a relationship by negotiating.</p><p>In all my time as an instructor at App Academy, out of hundreds of offers negotiated, only once or twice were offers ever rescinded in negotiations. It basically never happens. And when it does, usually the candidate was being an unconscionable asshole, or the company was imploding and needed an excuse to rescind the offer.</p><p>You might think to yourself: “<em>well, I don’t want to set high expectations, and the offer is already generous, so I ought to just take it.</em>“</p><p>Or maybe: “<em>I don’t want to start off on the wrong foot and look greedy with my future employer.</em>“</p><p>“<em>But this company is small and—</em>“</p><p>We’ll talk more in the next section about why a lot of these objections are bullshit, and fundamentally misapprehend the dynamics of hiring. But for now, just trust me that you should always negotiate.</p><h2>The ten rules of negotiating</h2><p>I’ve tried to boil down negotiation to ten rules. The rules, in order of appearance, are:</p><ol><li>Get everything in writing</li><li>Always keep the door open</li><li>Don’t be the decision maker</li><li>Proclaim reasons for everything</li><li>Be motivated by more than just money</li><li>Understand what they value</li></ol><p>We’ll only get through some of these in this blog post, and the rest will appear in the second part. But I’ll explain each rule as we get to it.</p><p>So let’s start from the top and try to walk through a negotiation process from the very beginning. For most, that starts when you receive an offer.</p><p>You’ve just received the phone call: your interview went well, and after much deliberation they decided they like you. They want to make you an offer. Congratulations!</p><p>Don’t get too excited though. The fun is just getting started.</p><p>Thank your recruiter. Sound excited—hopefully this won’t be hard. Before jumping into details, try to ask for specific feedback on your interview performance. If they give it to you, this will help you gauge how much they want you, as well as tell you things you can improve on in your next interview(s).</p><p>Now time to explore the offer.</p><p><strong>Rule #1 of negotiating: have everything in writing.</strong></p><p>Eventually, they’ll give you information about the offer. Write it all down. Doesn’t matter if they’re going to send you a written version later, . Even if there are things that are not directly monetary, if they relate to the job, write them down. If they tell you “we’re working on porting the front-end to Angular,” write that down. If they say they have 20 employees, write that down. You want as much information as you can. You’ll forget a lot of this stuff, and it’s going to be important in informing your final decision.</p><p>Depending on the company, they’ll also tell you about the equity package. We’ll look more specifically at equity in part II, but be sure to write everything down.</p><p>The rule from here on out is that everything significant you discuss will have some kind of a paper trail. Often, the company won’t even send you an official offer letter until a deal is finalized. So it falls to you to confirm all of the important details in subsequent e-mails.</p><p>So yadda yadda, lots of details, writing stuff down, oh there’s a joke, time to laugh. Now the recruiter is done talking and you’re done asking all of your questions.</p><p>Your recruiter will now say something along the lines of ““</p><p>This seems innocuous, but your reply here is critical, because there’s a lot you can say to weaken your position. This is your first decision point.</p><p>A decision point is a moment in the negotiation where your interlocutor wants to compel you to make a decision. If they succeed in tying you to a position, they will close the door on further negotiating. Of course “what do you think?” is a subtle prod. But it is the beginning of many attempts to get you to make a premature commitment.</p><p><strong>This leads to rule #2 of negotiating: always keep the door open.</strong> Never give up your negotiating power until you’re absolutely ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision.</p><p>This means your job is to traverse as many of these decision points as possible without giving up the power to continue negotiating. Very frequently, your interlocutor will try to trick you into making a decision, or tie you to a decision you didn’t commit to. You must keep verbally jiu-jitsu-ing out of these antics until you’re actually ready to make your final decision.</p><p>There’s an uncomfortable silence by now, and their “” is hanging in the air.</p><p>If you say “<em>yes, that sounds amazing, when do I start?</em>” you implicitly accept the offer and completely close the door on the negotiation. This is your recruiter’s number one favorite thing to hear. It stands to reason you probably shouldn’t do this.</p><p>But their second favorite thing to hear you say is “<em>can you do 90K instead of 85K?</em>” This also closes the door, but for a different and more subtle reason. And it’s the number one reason why most people suck at negotiation.</p><p><strong>Rule #3 of negotiating: information is power.</strong> To protect your power in the negotiation, you must protect information as much as possible.</p><p>A company doesn’t give you insight into what it’s thinking. It doesn’t tell you its price range, how much it paid the previous candidate with your experience, or anything like that. It intentionally obfuscates those things. But it wants you not to do the same.</p><p>A company wants to be like a bidder in a secret auction. But unlike the other bidders, it wants to know exactly how high all of the other bids are. It then openly intends to exploit that knowledge, often by bidding one cent more than the second highest bid.</p><p>Yeah, no. Screw that. It’s a silent auction, and to keep it that way, you must protect information.</p><p>In many situations, the only reason why you have any negotiating power at all is because the employer doesn’t actually know what you’re thinking. They might not know how good your other offers are, or how much you were making in your last job, or how you weigh salary vs equity, or even how rational you are as a decision-maker. Bottom line, you want them to be uncertain on exactly what it would take to sign you.</p><p>When you say “<em>can you do 90K instead of 85K,</em>” you’ve told them exactly what it will take to make you sign. The sheet’s pulled back, the secret auction is up, and they’re going to bid 90K (or more likely, 87K). And they know there’s almost no risk in doing so, because you’ll probably accept.</p><p>What if you were the kind of person who wouldn’t even consider an offer below 110K? Or the kind of person who wouldn’t consider an offer below 120K? If you were, you wouldn’t ask for 90K, and if they offered it as conciliation, you’d tell them to stop wasting your time.</p><p>By staying silent, <em>they don’t actually know which of those kinds of people you are.</em> In their mind, you could be any of the three.</p><p>A corollary of this rule is that you should not reveal to companies what you’re currently making. There are some exceptions, but as a rule you should assume this. If you must divulge what you’re making, you should be liberal in noting the total value of your package (incorporate bonuses, unvested stock, nearness to promotion etc.), and always mention it in a context like “<em>[XYZ] is what I’m currently making, and I’m definitely looking for a step up in my career for my next role.</em>“</p><p>Companies will ask about your current compensation at different stages in the process—some before they ever interview you, some after they decide to make you an offer. But be mindful of this, and protect information.</p><p>So given this offer, don’t ask for more money or equity or anything of the sort. Don’t comment on any specific details of the offer except to clarify them.</p><p>Give away nothing. Retain your power.</p><p>Say instead: “<em>Yeah, [COMPANY_NAME] sounds great! I really thought this was a good fit, and I’m glad that you guys agree. Right now I’m talking with a few other companies so I can’t speak to the specific details of the offer until I’m done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I’m sure we’ll be able to find a package that we’re both happy with, because I really would love to be a part of the team.</em>“</p><p>Think like the watermelon farmer. This offer is just is the first businessman who’s stopped by your watermelon patch, glanced over your crops, and announced “I’ll take all of these right now for $2 a melon.”</p><p>Cool. It’s a big market, and you’re patient—you’re a farmer after all. Just smile and tell them you’ll keep their offer in mind.</p><p>And this is super important: always be unequivocally positive.</p><h2>The importance of positivity</h2><p><strong>Staying positive is rule #4 of negotiation</strong>. Even if the offer is shit, it’s extremely important to remain positive and excited about the company. This is because <em>your excitement is one of your most valuable assets in a negotiation.</em></p><p>A company is making you an offer because they think you’ll do hard work for them if they pay you. If you lose your excitement for the company during the interview process, then they’ll lose confidence that you’ll actually want to work hard or stay there for a long time. Each of those makes you less attractive as an investment. Remember, you are the product! If you become less excited, then the product you’re selling actually loses value.</p><p>Imagine you were negotiating with someone over buying your watermelons, but the negotiation took so long that by the time you’d reached an agreement, your watermelons had gone bad.</p><p>Companies are terrified of that. They don’t want their candidates to go bad during a negotiation. Hence why they hire professional recruiters to manage the process and make sure they remain amicable. You and the recruiter share the same interest in that regard. If a company feels like you’ve gone bad, suddenly they’re a lot less willing to pay for you.</p><p>So despite whatever is happening in the negotiation, give the company the impression that 1) you still like the company, and that 2) you’re still excited to work there, even if the numbers or the money or the timing is not working out. Generally the most convincing thing to signal this is to reiterate you love the mission, the team, or the problem they’re working on, and really want to see things work out.</p><h2>Don’t be the decision-maker</h2><p>You can wrap up the conversation now by saying:</p><blockquote><p>I’ll look over some of these details and discuss it with my [FAMILY/CLOSE_FRIENDS/SIGNIFICANT_OTHER]. I’ll reach out to you if I have any questions. Thanks so much for sharing the good news with me, and I’ll be in touch!</p></blockquote><p>So not only are you ending the conversation with the power all in your hands, but note there’s another important move here: you’re roping in other decision-makers.</p><p><strong>Rule #5 of negotiation: don’t be the decision-maker.</strong> Even if you don’t particularly care what your friends/family/husband/mother thinks, by mentioning them, you’re no longer the only person the recruiter needs to win over. There’s no point in them trying to bully and intimidate you; the “true decision-maker” is beyond their reach.</p><p>This is a classic technique in customer support and remediation. It’s never the person on the phone’s fault, they’re just some poor schmuck doing their job. It’s not their decision to make. This helps to defuse tension and give them more control of the situation.</p><p>It’s much harder to pressure someone if they’re not the final decision-maker. So take advantage of that.</p><p>We have our first offer. Send a follow-up e-mail confirming all of the details you discussed with your recruiter so you have a paper trail. Just say “<em>just wanted to confirm I had all the details right.</em>“</p><p>Groovy. Next step is to leverage this to land other offers and find the best deal we can find in the job market.</p><p>Turns out, it doesn’t matter that much where your first offer is from, or even how much they’re offering you. Just having an offer in hand will get the engine running.</p><p>If you’re already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you’re doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you’ve just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.</p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to update you on my own process. I’ve just received an offer from [COMPANY] which is quite strong. That said, I’m really excited about [YOUR AMAZING COMPANY] and really want to see if we can make it work. Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to expedite the process?</p></blockquote><p>Should you specifically mention the company that gave you an offer? Depends. If it’s a well-known company or a competitor, then definitely mention it. If it’s a no-name or unsexy company, you should just say you received an offer. If it’s expiring soon, you should mention that as well.</p><p>Either way, send out a letter like this to every single company you’re talking to. No matter how hopeless or pointless you think your application is, you want to send this signal to everyone who is considering you in the market.</p><p>Second, if there are any other companies you are looking to apply to (whether through referral or cold application), or even companies at which you’ve already applied but haven’t heard back, I would also follow up with a similar e-mail.</p><p>So why do this? Isn’t this tacky, annoying, or even desperate?</p><p>None of the above. It is the oldest method in history to galvanize a marketplace—show that supplies are limited and build urgency. Demand breeds demand. Not every company will respond to this, but many will.</p><p>Isn’t it stupid that companies respond to this though?</p><p><a href=\"https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/\">When I wrote about the story of my own job search</a>, I mentioned how having an offer from Google made companies turn around and expedite me through their funnels. Many commentators lamented at the capriciousness of these companies. If Uber or Twitch only talked to me because of Google and until then weren’t willing to look at me, what did that say about their hiring processes? What legitimately are they evaluating, if anything at all?</p><p>I think this response is totally backwards. The behavior of tech companies here is actually very rational, and you would do well to understand it.</p><p>First, you must realize what a company’s goal is. A company’s goal is to hire someone who will become an effective employee and produce more value than their cost. How do you figure out who will do that? Well, you can’t know for certain without actually hiring them, but there are a few proxies. Pedigree is the strongest signal; if they did it at other companies, they can probably do it at yours. And if someone trusted within the organization can vouch for them, that’s often a strong signal as well.</p><p>But turns out, almost everything else is a weak signal. Weak in the sense that it’s just not very reliable. Interviews, if you think about it, are long, sweaty, uncomfortable affairs that only glancingly resemble actual employment. They’re weird and can’t tell you that much about whether an individual will be a good at their job. There’s no way around this. There are a few stronger signals, like bringing someone in for a week or two on a contract-to-hire position, but strong candidates won’t consider this. So candidates as a whole have effectively forced companies to assume almost all of the risk in hiring.</p><p>The truth is, knowing that someone has passed your interview just doesn’t say  about whether they’ll be a good employee. It’s as though you knew nothing about a student other than their SAT score. It’s just not a lot of data to go off.</p><p>Nobody has solved this problem. Not Google nor anyone else.</p><p>And this is precisely why it’s rational for companies to care that you’ve received other offers. They care because each company knows that their own process is noisy, and the processes of most other companies are also noisy. But a candidate having multiple offers means that they have multiple weak signals in their favor. Combined, these converge into a much stronger signal than any single interview. It’s like knowing that a student has a strong SAT score, and GPA, and won various scholarships. Sure, it’s still possible that they’re a dunce, but it’s much harder for that to be true.</p><p>This is not to say that companies respond proportionally to these signals, or that they don’t overvalue credentials and brands. They do. But caring about whether you have other offers and valuing you accordingly is completely rational.</p><p>So this is all to say—tell other companies that you’ve received offers. Give them more signal so that they know you’re a valued and compelling candidate. And understand why this changes their mind about whether to interview you.</p><p>As you continue interviewing, remember to keep practicing your interview skills. The single strongest determinant of your final offer will be the number and strength of offers that you receive.</p><p>You want to be strategic about the timing of your offers. Generally, you should try to start interviewing at larger companies earlier. Their processes are slower and their offer windows are wider (meaning they allow you more time to decide). Startups are the other way around.</p><p>Your goal should be to have as many offers overlapping at the same time as possible. This will maximize your window for negotiating.</p><p>When you receive an offer, often the first thing you should ask for is more time to make your decision. Especially in your first offer, more time is by far the most valuable thing you can ask for. It’s time that enables you to activate other companies and end up with the strongest possible offer. So be prepared to fight for time.</p><h2>How to approach exploding offers</h2><p>Exploding offers are offers that expire within 24-72 hours. You won’t see this much at big companies, but they’re becoming increasingly common among startups and mid-sized companies.</p><p>Exploding offers suck, and I share most people’s disdain for this practice. But I do understand it. Exploding offers are a natural weapon for employers to combat a strong hiring market for tech workers. Companies know exactly what they’re doing with exploding offers—they play on fear and limit your ability to seek out counteroffers.</p><p>In a sense, it’s unsurprising that if startups have more difficulty attracting and securing talent, they’d resort to this practice. What I don’t like is the dishonesty about it. Employers often justify this by saying “<em>If you need more time than this, then that’s a sign you’re not the kind of person we’re looking for.</em>“</p><p>Please don’t buy this crap or feel guilty over it. They’re simply doing this to improve their chance of closing candidates. Needing more than three days to make a life decision isn’t a sign of anything other than thoughtfulness.</p><p>So what should you do if you receive an exploding offer?</p><p>Exploding offers are anathema to your ability to effectively navigate the labor market. Thus, there is only one thing to do. Treat the offer as a non-offer unless the expiration window is widened.</p><p>In no uncertain terms, convey that if the offer is exploding, it’s useless to you.</p><blockquote><p>I have one big concern. You mentioned that this offer explodes in 48 hours. I’m afraid this doesn’t work at all for me. There’s no way that I can make a decision on this offer within a 48 hour window. I’m currently wrapping up my interview process at a few other companies, which is likely to take me another week or so. So I’m going to need more time to make an informed decision.</p></blockquote><p>If they push back and say this is the best they can do, then politely reply:</p><blockquote><p>That’s really unfortunate. I like [YOUR COMPANY] and was really excited about the team, but like I said, there’s no way I can consider this offer. 48 hours just too unreasonable of a window. The next company I join will be a big life decision for me, and I take my commitments very seriously. I also need to consult with my [EXTERNAL_DECISION_MAKER]. There’s no way that I can make a decision I’m comfortable with in this short an amount of time.</p></blockquote><p>Pretty much any company will relent at this point. If they persist, don’t be afraid to walk away over it. (They probably won’t let that happen, and will come grab you as you’re walking out the door. But if they don’t, then honestly, screw ‘em.)</p><p>I was given several exploding offers during my job search. And every time, I did essentially this. Every single offer immediately widened to become more reasonable, sometimes by several weeks.</p><p>I want to emphasize, lest I be misunderstood here—what I’m saying is not to just silently let an exploding offer expire, and assume that everything will be fine and they’ll still hire you. They won’t. For exploding offers to be a credible weapon, a company has to have a reputation of enforcing them. I’m saying explicitly call this out as an issue when they make the offer.</p><p>Don’t let a company bully you into giving away your negotiating power.</p><p>Before we enter into the actual back-and-forth, I want to examine the mindset you should have as a negotiator. This applies not just to how you approach the conversation, but also to how you think about the company.</p><p>Do not fall into the trap of valuing companies solely along one dimension. That means don’t just value companies based on salary, equity, or even on prestige. Those are all important dimensions, but so are cultural fit, the challenge of the work, learning potential, later career options, quality of life, growth potential, and just overall happiness. None of these inherently trump any of the other. Anyone who tells you “just choose wherever you think you’ll be happiest” is being just as simplistic than someone who says “just choose the one that offers the most money.” All of these things matter, and your decision should be genuinely multi-dimensional.</p><p>Be open to being surprised as you explore different companies.</p><p>It’s also important to understand that companies don’t all value you along the same dimension either. That is, different companies are genuinely looking for different skills, and there are some companies at which you will be more and less valuable. Even at peer companies this is true, especially so if you have a specialized skill-set.</p><p>The more companies you talk to, the more likely you are to find a company to which you are significantly more valuable than the rest. Chances are this is where you’ll be able to negotiate your strongest offer. It might surprise you which company this turns out to be; keep an open mind, and remember that a job search is a 2-sided process.</p><p>One of the most valuable things you can do for yourself in this process is to really try to understand how employers think and what motivates them. Understanding your interlocutor is extremely important in negotiation, and we’ll be exploring that a lot in the next blog post.</p><p>But most of all I want to emphasize: be curious about the other side. Try to understand why employers think the way they do. Be sympathetic toward them. Care about what they want and help them try to get it. Adopting this mindset will make you a much stronger negotiator, and accordingly, a much better employee and team member.</p><p>Okay. That’s as far as we’re going for today. In the next blog post, I’m going to cover the last four rules of negotiation. I’ll also go over the actual back-and-forth process—how to ask for what you want, how to strengthen offers, and how to dismantle the tricks that companies will try to pull on you. Also a lot more on the theory of negotiation, which I really dig.</p>","contentLength":28333,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596864"}],"tags":["dev"]}
