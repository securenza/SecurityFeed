I <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/filosottile\">livecoded</a> it all over four days, finishing it on Thursday evening. Except… Verify was always rejecting valid signatures.</p><pre><code>$ bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa\n--- FAIL: TestVector (0.00s)\n    mldsa_test.go:47: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature\n    mldsa_test.go:84: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature\n    mldsa_test.go:121: Verify: mldsa: invalid signature\nFAIL\nFAIL     crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa   2.142s\nFAIL\n</code></pre><p>I was exhausted, so I tried debugging for half an hour and then gave up, with the intention of coming back to it the next day with a fresh mind.</p><p>On a whim, I figured I would let Claude Code take a shot while I read emails and resurfaced from hyperfocus. I mostly expected it to flail in some maybe-interesting way, or rule out some issues.</p><p>Instead, it rapidly figured out a fairly complex low-level bug in my implementation of a relatively novel cryptography algorithm. I am sharing this because it made me realize I still don’t have a good intuition for when to invoke AI tools, and because I think it’s a fantastic case study for anyone who’s still skeptical about their usefulness.</p><blockquote><p>Full disclosure: Anthropic gave me a few months of Claude Max for free. They reached out one day and told me they were giving it away to some open source maintainers. Maybe it’s a ploy to get me hooked so I’ll pay for it when the free coupon expires. Maybe they hoped I’d write something like this. Maybe they are just nice. Anyway, they made no request or suggestion to write anything public about Claude Code. Now you know.</p></blockquote><p>I started Claude Code v2.0.28 with Opus 4.1 and no system prompts, and gave it the following prompt (typos included):</p><blockquote><p>I implemented ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and it all works except that verification always rejects the signatures. I know the signatures are right because they match the test vector.</p><p>YOu can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p><p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p><p>Look for potential reasons the signatures don’t verify. ultrathink</p><p>I spot-checked and w1 is different from the signing one.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised! Maybe it would have been clear to anyone more familiar with AI tools that this was a good AI task: a well-scoped issue with failing tests. On the other hand, this is a low-level issue in a fresh implementation of a complex,  algorithm.</p><p>It figured out that I had merged  and  into a single function for using it from Sign, and then reused it from Verify where  already produces the high bits, effectively taking the high bits of w1 twice in Verify.</p><p>Looking at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/d019f68db7143493c6a7e9c5fd08e872\">the log</a>, it loaded the implementation into the context and then  figured it out, without any exploratory tool use! After that it wrote itself a cute little test that reimplemented half of verification to confirm the hypothesis, wrote a mediocre fix, and checked the tests pass.</p><p>I <a href=\"https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/716540/2..3\">threw the fix away</a> and refactored  to take high bits as input, and changed the type of the high bits, which is both clearer and saves a round-trip through Montgomery representation. Still, this 100% saved me a bunch of debugging time.</p><h2>A second synthetic experiment</h2><p>On Monday, I had also finished implementing signing with failing tests. There were two bugs, which I fixed in the following couple evenings.</p><p>I figured these would be an interesting way to validate Claude’s ability to help find bugs in low-level cryptography code, so I checked out the old version of the change with the bugs (yay Jujutsu!) and kicked off a fresh Claude Code session with this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector it looks like it goes into an infinite loop, probably because it always rejects in the Fiat-Shamir with Aborts loop.</p><p>You can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p><p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p><p>Figure out why it loops forever, and get the tests to pass. ultrathink</p></blockquote><p>It gave up after fixing that bug even if the tests still failed, so I started a fresh session (on the assumption that the context on the wrong constants would do more harm than good investigating an independent bug), and gave it this prompt:</p><blockquote><p>I am implementing ML-DSA in the Go standard library, and I just finished implementing signing, but running the tests against a known good test vector they don’t match.</p><p>You can run the tests with “bin/go test crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa”</p><p>You can find the code in src/crypto/internal/fips140/mldsa</p><p>Figure out what is going on. ultrathink</p></blockquote><p>It’s interesting how Claude found the “easier” bug more difficult. My guess is that maybe the large random-looking outputs of the failing tests did not play well with its attention.</p><p>The fix it proposed was updating only the allocation’s length and not its capacity, but whatever, the point is finding the bug, and I’ll usually want to throw away the fix and rewrite it myself anyway.</p><p>Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is . Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.</p><p>As ever, I wish we had better tooling for using LLMs which didn’t look like chat or autocomplete or “make me a PR.” For example, how nice would it be if every time tests fail, an LLM agent was kicked off with the task of figuring out why, and only notified us if it did before we fixed it?</p><p>Enjoy the silliest floof.

The withdrawal by the current  represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><h2>A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2><p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a , repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/\">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the  follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p><p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p><h2>The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning</h2><p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption\">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p><p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for “good guys.”  learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.</p><h2>Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p><p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, , and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p><p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href=\"https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/\">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p><p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p><h2>The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2><p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p><p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p><p> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p><p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>","contentLength":8587,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783114"},{"title":"GHC now runs in the browser","url":"https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-now-runs-in-your-browser/13169","date":1762014563,"author":"kaycebasques","guid":103332,"unread":true,"content":"<div itemprop=\"text\"><p>thanks for the reports! a few seconds of freeze during start-time is expected, since it needs to download ~50M of a rootfs tarball and extract it, then link the ghc library and all its dependencies. as for safari, it’s strange since i i just landed a workaround for a webkit bug that breaks the wasm dynamic linker a few days ago, i’ll take a closer look later.</p></div>","contentLength":365,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782981"},{"title":"Updated practice for review articles and position papers in ArXiv CS category","url":"https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/10/31/attention-authors-updated-practice-for-review-articles-and-position-papers-in-arxiv-cs-category/","date":1762009085,"author":"dw64","guid":103274,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45782136"},{"title":"SQLite concurrency and why you should care about it","url":"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/","date":1762001943,"author":"HunOL","guid":103331,"unread":true,"content":"<p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p><p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p><p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p><p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p><p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.\nOverall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.\nNaturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p><p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.\nHaving established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p><p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).\nThe WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.\nThis allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.\nWhen another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.\nThis is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p><p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.\nModifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.\nThis is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.\nFor some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.\nThis seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p><p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.\nFrom the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.\nSo we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p><p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.\nDuring normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.\nIn versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.\nWhile most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.\nThat and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p><p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.\nEF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interceptors</a>.\nWith an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just \"not\" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.\nThe overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.\nSo, I decided on three locking strategies:</p><ol></ol><p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p><p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override  in .</p><h3>Optimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#optimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to \"Try and Retry and Retry ...\" for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.\nThis still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p><p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p><p>Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p><h3>Pessimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#pessimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.\nThis however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p><p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table \"Alice\" while writing to table \"Bob\" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.\nWhile this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p><p>Jellyfin uses a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p><h3>The future Smart locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#the-future-smart-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p><p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p><p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.\nThere have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a \"ready to drop in\" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.\nJellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>","contentLength":7955,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781298"},{"title":"Do you know that there is an HTML tables API?","url":"https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/08/abandonware-of-the-web-do-you-know-that-there-is-an-html-tables-api/","date":1762001901,"author":"begoon","guid":103273,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When people turn data into  tables using JavaScript, they either use the  methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern.

Check out the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/codepo8/pen/RNrVPzq?editors=1111\" title=\"\">Codepen</a> to see how you can create a table from a nested array:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>let table \nlet b  document.\nlet t  document.\nb.t\ntable.rowri\n  let r  t.ri\n  row.li\n    let c  r.i\n    c. l</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><p>let table = [\n  ['one','two','three'],\n  ['four','five','six']\n];\nlet b = document.body;\nlet t = document.createElement('table');\nb.appendChild(t);\ntable.forEach((row,ri) =&gt; {\n  let r = t.insertRow(ri);\n  row.forEach((l,i) =&gt; {\n    let c = r.insertCell(i);\n    c.innerText = l;  \n  })\n});</p></div><p>You can then access each table cell with an index (with t being a reference to the table):</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>console.t..</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><p>console.log(t.rows[1].cells[1]);\n// =&gt; &lt;td&gt;five&lt;/td&gt;</p></div><p>You can also delete and create cells and rows, if you want to add a row to the end of the table with a cell, all you need to do is:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>t.\nt..\nt...</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><p>t.insertRow(-1);\nt.rows[2].insertCell(0);\nt.rows[2].cells[0].innerText = 'foo';</p></div><p>There are a few things here that are odd – adding a -1 to add a row at the end for example – and there seems to be no way to create a TH element instead of a TD. All table cells are just cells.</p><p>However, seeing how much of a pain it is to create tables, it would be fun to re-visit this  and add more functionality to it. We did add a lot of things to  forms, like formData and the change event, so why not add events and other features to tables. That way they’d finally get the status as data structures and not a hack to layout content on the web.</p>","contentLength":1911,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45781293"},{"title":"You can't refuse to be scanned by ICE's facial recognition app, DHS document say","url":"https://www.404media.co/you-cant-refuse-to-be-scanned-by-ices-facial-recognition-app-dhs-document-says/","date":1761987534,"author":"nh43215rgb","guid":103256,"unread":true,"content":"<div>Photos captured by Mobile Fortify will be stored for 15 years, regardless of immigration or citizenship status, the document says.</div>","contentLength":130,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45780228"},{"title":"Hard Rust requirements from May onward","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2025/10/msg00285.html","date":1761982300,"author":"rkta","guid":103307,"unread":true,"content":"<pre>Hi all,\n\nI plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into\nAPT, no earlier than May 2026.

Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">Paul Graham famously wrote about \"ramen profitability\"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is \"understaffed compared to benchmarks.\" Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup.

Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p><h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors#the-basics-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-theory\"></a>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2><p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.

Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p><p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p><p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p><h2>Why We Explored a New Approach</h2><p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href=\"https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/\">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p><p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href=\"https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/\">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href=\"http://case.law\">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p><p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p><h2>Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2><p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/\">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href=\"https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/\">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href=\"https://protomaps.com\">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p><p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li><li> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li><li> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li></ul><p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet\">hyparquet</a> and <a href=\"https://idl.uw.edu/arquero\">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p><p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p><h2>Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2><p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p><ul><li> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li><li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li><li> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li></ul><p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p><ul><li> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li><li> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li></ul><p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at <a href=\"mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu\">lil@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>","contentLength":5646,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45774571"},{"title":"Just use a button","url":"https://gomakethings.com/just-use-a-button/","date":1761929962,"author":"moebrowne","guid":103144,"unread":true,"content":"<p>One of the weirdest “debates” I seem to perpetually have with framework-enthusiastic developers is whether or not a  is “just as good” as a .</p><p> it’s not.

They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is \" to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>.\"&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"</p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/\">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href=\"https://openinfra.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: \"Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration.\" &nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/\">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href=\"https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an \"unprofessional, rushed operation.\" Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector.

Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8\" target=\"_blank\">appears today</a> in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>","contentLength":6622,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771636"},{"title":"How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html","date":1761915826,"author":"reaperducer","guid":102939,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology.

Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.</p><p>This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.</p><h2>Electronic passport basics</h2><p>A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in <a href=\"https://www.icao.int/publications/doc-series/doc-9303\">ICAO Doc 9303</a>; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.</p><p>The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).</p><h3>How the eMRTD application works</h3><p>The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:</p><p>There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.</p><p>Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.</p><h2>Digging into the threat model</h2><p>Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:</p><ul><li>Read any personal information from that passport</li><li>Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals</li><li>Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements</li></ul><p>Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Forge a new passport with inauthentic data</li><li>Make a digital copy of the passport</li><li>Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information</li></ul><p>Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).</p><p>We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.</p><p>The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.</p><p>While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.</p><p>Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.</p><h4>Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails</h4><p>In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.</p><p>Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!</p><p>This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.</p><p>However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for <a href=\"https://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc10/17_43.pdf\">oracle attacks that allow tracing</a> by replaying valid terminal responses.</p><h4>Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time</h4><p>Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.</p><p>The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.</p><h4>Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain</h4><p>Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.</p><p>This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography.</p><p>Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.</p><h4>Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel</h4><p>CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.</p><h4>Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4</h4><p>Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.</p><h4>Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems</h4><p>The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.</p><p>First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive a password key. Next, the passport encrypts a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.</p><p>Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.</p><h2>Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone</h2><p>When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system  with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.</p><p>Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.</p><p>However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you <a href=\"https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/in-vendita-documenti-di-identita-trafugati-da-hotel-italiani/\">visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked</a>, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.</p><p>Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.</p><p>Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.</p><h2>Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs</h2><p>An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.</p><p>First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?</p><p>Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service.</p><p>Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.</p><p>It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider.

As always, I am not a\nprofessional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just\nsubjective thoughts!</p><p>Back in 2021, I wrote about the <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/\">MacBook Air\nM1</a>, which was the first computer I used that\ncontained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery\nlife was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.</p><p>When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year\nold MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more\nyears. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could\nhave stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.</p><h2>The nano-textured display</h2><p>I went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in\nperson. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased\nweight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be\nacceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I\nreally like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro\nowners that the fan mostly stays off.</p><p>In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has\nenough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation\nslots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.</p><p>Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented\nthe trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing\nreflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.</p><p>I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:\nThe bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display\n(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):</p><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays.jpg\"><img srcset=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_8c87fe476c5344b6.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_243730d5507ecc98.jpg 3x\" src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_4cb7e6e8fae8437.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" title=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was\nclear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for\nthe nano texture display!</p><p>After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this\nchoice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous\nlaptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next\nto the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.</p><p>(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have\nreleased the first devices with M5 chips.)</p><p>I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip\nbecause I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4\nPro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.</p><p>Here are the specs I ended up with:</p><ul><li>14\" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano texture</li><li>Apple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)</li><li>32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)</li></ul><p>One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it\nis connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for\nhours). I’m not sure why.</p><p>Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once\nin half a year or so?</p><p>The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day\nbattery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,\nwatching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of\nbattery life. I generally never even carry the charger.</p><p>Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector\n(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but\ndoesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to\npack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you\nuse the charger.</p><p>I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I\nmostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,\nfor example, when scrolling.</p><p>One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations\ncan become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I\nnoticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120\nHz display!</p><p>The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms\nof processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average\ncase and the worst case):</p><ol><li>Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.</li><li>Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.</li><li>Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delay</li></ol><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\"><img src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\" alt=\"delay\" title=\"delay\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>As you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one\nframe every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with\na system that has &lt;8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up\nto) twice as fast!</p><p>I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,\nwhere a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120\nHz displays are more interesting.</p><p>My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)</p><p>I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But\n<a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\">Asahi Linux</a> still needs some work before it’s usable\nfor me (I need external display output, and M4 support).

Relentless <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation\">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago\">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p>","contentLength":5138,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767325"},{"title":"Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture","url":"https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Linear","date":1761869256,"author":"blackcat201","guid":103061,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766937"},{"title":"Leaker reveals which Pixels are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/","date":1761865930,"author":"akyuu","guid":103163,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766501"},{"title":"A change of address led to our Wise accounts being shut down","url":"https://shaun.nz/why-were-never-using-wise-again-a-cautionary-tale-from-a-business-burned/","date":1761864110,"author":"jemmyw","guid":102609,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of  (formerly TransferWise).

Convention against Cybercrime</a> in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime. </p><p> The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&nbsp; </p><p> In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.” </p><p> “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres <a href=\"https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1mmr6e30l?fbclid=IwY2xjawNsbKBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEaEJoeEdZVm5jOHFrbUZwAR6naDVwPBo0PIG40vUDzWufVp-JMZnPlhXObSoo82Td1voIWEEcVPyLc4VCqw_aem_BZcBFnBsiMKuxTexgtKUBA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>.&nbsp; </p><p> “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.” </p><p> He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&nbsp; </p><p> While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S. </p><p> Officials at the State Department <a href=\"https://therecord.media/cybercrime-treaty-signing-hanoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told Recorded Future News on Friday</a> that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&nbsp; </p><p> The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&nbsp; </p><p> “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly <a href=\"https://therecord.media/un-general-assembly-approves-cybercrime-treaty-despite-industry-pushback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in December 2024</a> and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&nbsp; </p><p> At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.” </p><p> U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.” </p><p> “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.” </p><p> The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests. </p><p> Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; </p><p> Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p><p> It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&nbsp; </p><p> Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.” </p><p> In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&nbsp; </p><p> But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&nbsp; </p><p> “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” </p>","contentLength":5174,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760328"},{"title":"Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews","url":"https://0github.com/","date":1761834118,"author":"lawrencechen","guid":102879,"unread":true,"content":"<p>0github.com is a pull request viewer that color-codes every diff line/token by how much human attention it probably needs.

With all this on-screen text, it is very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking.</p><p>As such, <strong>if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text.</strong> At bare minimum, when subtitling anime, you should be able to do  (multiple lines of text on the screen at the same time) and  (the ability to freely place subtitles anywhere on the screen). Anything less and you are likely to run into trouble the moment you get to something as simple as a next episode preview:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview.

Typesetting is important even when dubbing anime, as all that on-screen text is going to be there in the video all the same!</p><h2>So why would Crunchyroll get rid of typesetting?</h2><p>That is a good question. It is no exaggeration to say that up to this point, Crunchyroll with its typesetting was the unambiguous market leader when it came to presentation quality for official anime subtitles… though for the most part, <strong>other services dealing in anime have never even bothered to try.</strong> Sentai Filmworks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hidive</a> is just about the only other anime service that even attempts to do typesetting, though they license so few shows per season that they are a tiny player compared to the Big Boys of anime streaming.</p><p>And it is very likely the existence of these Big Boys that has played a key part in Crunchyroll’s eradication of its typesetting. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime Video</a> probably need no introduction to anyone reading this – both are very popular general streaming services. <strong>Despite anime being only a minor part of their catalogs, a large chunk of today’s anime watching worldwide happens through said services</strong> thanks to their sheer user counts alone.</p><p>Crunchyroll clearly seems to know this, which is why it has been sublicensing its anime properties to both Amazon and Netflix for multiple years at this point. <strong>But with such sublicensing comes the matter of dealing with the subtitling standards of general streaming services.</strong> I’m not going to mince words: these standards are  at least as far as anime is concerned. Netflix for example insists that you <a href=\"https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/215758617-Timed-Text-Style-Guide-General-Requirements#h_01JX10EE4EPSNQ2R6HGDADJBZA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stick to at most two lines of text on screen at once,</a> which makes sense most of the time… if you’re talking about dialogue alone. Unfortunately, it becomes completely inadequate when dealing with anime’s plentiful on-screen text. Moreover, the standards of these services actively refuse to give you tools like positioning and overlaps, even though the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TTML subtitle format</a> they use supports said features!</p><p>With such typesetting-hostile standards to deal with, Crunchyroll had basically two choices for how to make sublicensing to Amazon and Netflix work with their existing subtitles that feature actual typesetting: Either 1) try to negotiate with the services for permission to make use of more TTML capabilities (that the subtitle renderers of said services should already support!) or 2) <strong>start mangling subtitles with typesetting into something compatible with the awful subtitling standards of the general streaming services.</strong> I am not aware if Crunchyroll ever attempted the former, but I can confirm that it eventually started doing the latter.</p><p>Editors among Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff were  to convert finished high quality subtitles with typesetting into limited low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting, compatible with Amazon &amp; Netflix subtitling standards. They got paid extra for the manual effort required by the process.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Overlapping on-screen text and dialogue makes for a miserable anime watching experience with limited TTML subtitles. Video clip from  (Winter&nbsp;2018, Netflix)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, after a couple years of this kind of manual conversion work, the Crunchyroll leadership seems to have decided that it isn’t enough, and that <strong>Crunchyroll must do away with high quality subtitles with typesetting entirely and only produce low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting from now on.</strong> But if they already had a working process for high quality subtitles at home and low quality TTML subtitles elsewhere, why would they just decide to give that up in order to produce exclusively low quality subtitles? It doesn’t seem to make very much sense, even as a cost-cutting measure. There should be so much value in being able to advertise <em>best viewed on Crunchyroll</em> to potential audiences for long-term growth, right?</p><p>To understand  we need to look into some relevant history. <strong>Specifically, what happened after Sony bought Crunchyroll and merged it with Funimation,</strong> another US anime distributor that Sony had bought previously. But in order to also understand  first we need to look at what both Crunchyroll and Funimation were like before this fateful merger happened, as well as how they approached anime subtitling over the years.</p><h2>A short history of Crunchyroll and its subtitling standards</h2><p>Crunchyroll launched in 2006 as a pirate streaming site focused on East Asian media content, featuring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fansubbed</a> anime, live action drama, music videos, and so on. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the site back then – as a rule of thumb, pirate streaming sites are always worse quality-wise than if you just directly downloaded the pirated releases they use as a base, and the sites mostly exist to make their admins illicit money through ads, begging for donations, and other shady crap. It is important to note though that <strong>legal anime streaming basically wasn’t a thing at this time.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Crunchyroll in 2007.

This single decision was a fateful one, as it was the foundation for basically everything that came after – with former fansubbers on the job, the tools of the trade were set according to the standards of fansubbers: the subtitling software of choice was to be <a href=\"https://aegisub.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aegisub</a>, and <strong>the subtitle format of choice was to be Aegisub’s native format, Advanced SubStation Alpha, or ASS for short.</strong></p><p>ASS is an extremely powerful format in terms of formatting and styling capabilities, and with Aegisub, it is easy to produce ASS subtitles that make use of said capabilities. <strong>However, as a streaming site, Crunchyroll needed to be able to present these ASS subtitles in the browser somehow,</strong> and the only full-fledged ASS renderers that existed were only available in the traditional local media playback environments targeted by fansubbers, which meant that Crunchyroll couldn’t make use of said renderers on the web directly.</p><p>Now, there are two main ways to subtitle videos, with opposing pros and cons:</p><ul><li> – the subtitles are burned into the video itself.  as you only need to be able to play video, <strong>but inflexible for updates and multiple languages</strong> as you have to recreate your video files over and over again with expensive processing called .</li><li> – the subtitles exist as their own separate media track that the video player renders on top of the video in realtime during playback, making softsubs <strong>complex to playback, but updates and multiple tracks are very cheap</strong> as you only need to deal with tiny subtitle files while the video files remain unchanged.</li></ul><p>As such, one way Crunchyroll could have solved the subtitle presentation problem would have been to simply hardsub its ASS subtitles, but despite the challenges it posed, Crunchyroll decided to go with softsubbing instead (which was also the fansub standard at the time). <strong>And so Crunchyroll set out to build its own ASS renderer in Flash,</strong> the primary technology used to play video on the web at the time. Here’s a screenshot of some of the first subtitles ever officially authored by the fully legitimate Crunchyroll, rendered in the current ASS renderer but adhering to the limits of the company’s very first Flash subtitle renderer:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview.

Now, the positioning was limited to the eight edges and the center of the screen, making for just nine possible positions total, but even that was enough to handle the humble next episode preview at the very least. Beyond these, the first version also supported fading animations. It wasn’t much, <strong>but it did cover the bare minimum for dealing with on-screen text in anime.</strong></p><p>Over the years, Crunchyroll managed to slowly improve its Flash subtitle renderer to enable the use of more ASS features. Custom colors, multiple fonts, multiple styles, rotation, and full positioning were implemented (albeit in somewhat hacky and unwieldy fashion). This went on until 2018, when Crunchyroll was faced with a major issue: <strong>Flash was seeing rapid decline in use, and web streaming was shifting over to HTML5-based technology.</strong> However, with a custom ASS renderer built in Flash, Crunchyroll couldn’t easily make the change, as it would mean having to essentially rebuild the custom subtitle renderer they had from scratch in HTML5 (as much like in the Flash days, there still were no solutions native to the web available for rendering ASS subtitles).</p><p>However, Crunchyroll managed to come up with a way to solve the problem of moving from Flash to HTML5 with the help of another new web technology called <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly</a>, which allowed developers to take code that wasn’t developed for the web and compile it for use on the web. With WebAssembly, Crunchyroll could take <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/libass\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">libass</a>, one of the few fully-featured ASS renderers out there, and <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use it for their new HTML5 player</a>. Now, not only did all their old ASS subtitles render nicely in HTML5, but <strong>the possibilities for typesetting at Crunchyroll had taken a huge leap forward.</strong> And the subtitling staff at Crunchyroll was more than happy to make use of this newfound power.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">You couldn’t see typesetting like this on Crunchyroll back in the days of Flash. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2022, Crunchyroll)</figcaption></figure><p>That said, despite having a technically fully-featured ASS renderer to work with, <strong>there were still limitations.</strong> Code compiled with WebAssembly runs worse compared to its original native counterpart, which limits how heavy the typesetting can be (with the flexible features of ASS, it is very easy to produce typesetting that simply cannot be rendered in realtime even on powerful computers, resulting in notable lag during playback). A commercial service like Crunchyroll will also generally want to keep its content watchable even on lower-end devices, which further reduces how complex any typesetting can be.</p><p>And this is the limited but functional standard of typesetting that Crunchyroll users got to enjoy (with first-party subtitles) up until the fateful season of Fall 2025 that prompted the creation of this article.</p><p>Before we move to the conclusions for this section, though, it is worth noting that while Crunchyroll currently uses softsubbed ASS subtitles whenever it can, there are platforms and devices (like various TVs) where this kind of ASS rendering simply isn’t possible to do. <strong>Crunchyroll is available on some platforms like this, which means it has been making additional hardsubbed versions of everything on top of the usual softsubbed ones.</strong></p><p>So, what can we learn from all this? At least one thing is abundantly clear: for most of its existence, <strong>the leadership at Crunchyroll had at least some respect and understanding for anime as a medium.</strong> They understood that it was important to be able to deal with on-screen text in their subtitles, and allocated enough resources to make typesetting possible. The company even managed to improve in this regard over time, albeit very slowly.</p><p>That said, anyone familiar with anime fansubs of the 2010s and 2020s probably can’t help but feel disappointed that even the highest effort typesetting from Crunchyroll could only ever be on the level of fansub releases from around 2010 at best. Why 2010 specifically? <strong>Because from 2011 onwards, fansubbers started widely incorporating advanced motion tracking into their typesetting.</strong> Observe an example of such fansub typesetting from over a decade ago, the likes of which has never been seen on Crunchyroll:</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2013, Underwater fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Now, while fansubbers giving away their work for free might get away with saying <q>just get a better computer</q> to anyone whose devices can’t render softsubbed typesetting like this in realtime, an official service that lots of people pay for doesn’t really have the same luxury, which is the main reason why you don’t see stuff like this softsubbed on Crunchyroll. But this is not an insurmountable problem, so make no mistake: <strong>official anime services could absolutely offer typesetting with similar level of quality to the best of fansubs.</strong> The basic solution to the performance problem is very simple, even: you simply hardsub the typesetting. This would work from streaming to physical disc releases and only the sky would be the limit in terms of the typesetting quality you could offer, as realtime rendering would no longer be a concern!</p><p>Now, as mentioned earlier, hardsubbing does make things more complicated and expensive on the backend as you need to encode and store multiple copies of video. Crunchyroll is already dealing with this, though! But if costs are an issue, the system is pretty easy to improve in theory: if you keep the dialogue softsubbed, only the parts of the video that actually feature typesetting would be hardsubbed, and with some clever engineering and an understanding of how modern media formats work, you would only have to keep multiple copies of the typeset parts. <strong>And since the average anime episode has on-screen text only for a small percentage of its total runtime, combining softsubbed dialogue and hardsubbed typesetting like this would make for a highly cost-effective setup.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Typesetting like this would be possible to do even for official anime services. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2021, Chasa fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>And since with a mixed system like this you would only have softsubs for the technically simpler dialogue, you could even convert these dialogue-only ASS subtitles to a simpler but more widely supported subtitle format for playback, <strong>which theoretically should do away with the need to keep fully hardsubbed copies around entirely, without any real loss in quality!</strong> I actually built a minimal version of a mixed system like this myself when I was doing some anime streaming work a few years back and can confidently say that <strong>this would be extremely doable for any official anime service… as long as they just cared enough.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Keep this example of fansub typesetting in mind for later. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, UTW fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, any interest Crunchyroll had for improving their subtitle rendering for typesetting seemed to run out after the 2018 transition to WebAssembly libass. <strong>Not that it actually ever seemed to be all that high to begin with, though,</strong> as evident by some of the low-hanging fruit that Crunchyroll never bothered to pick in this regard; the most obvious of which would be Crunchyroll’s dogged insistence to restrict typesetting font choices to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core Fonts for the Web</a>. Free for commercial use fonts have been plentily available since the Flash days, and custom fonts have been well supported on the web for a similarly long time.</p><p>Anyway, it would have never been all that hard for Crunchyroll to support custom fonts for typesetting, especially after the 2018 move to HTML5. The underlying technology was there and font files are tiny in size compared to the video files being streamed – this would have been an extremely simple and effective improvement for all typesetting efforts. Yet Crunchyroll never reached for this improvement, which is why  has kept appearing in Crunchyroll typesetting with depressing regularity.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>There it is again.  Screenshot from  (Summer&nbsp;2023, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>It is also disappointing <strong>how regularly the anime staples of opening &amp; ending songs are still left untranslated on Crunchyroll,</strong> though this issue is admittedly <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-09-01/.120752\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">much harder to solve than you’d expect.</a> Still, it is possible to do so, especially with Sony’s resources behind the company today. That goes double when Sony is involved in anime production in any way, as then the songs being used should be well-known to all relevant parties well in advance of airing for timely rights-clearing. <strong>So if Crunchyroll/Sony is in any way involved with an anime’s production, it should basically always be possible for songs to be translated the moment the first episode is released.</strong></p><p>But that’s enough about Crunchyroll’s history. Now it’s time to look at the other company mentioned earlier and see how they’ve fared in comparison…</p><h2>A short history of Funimation and its subtitling standards</h2><p>In the early 90s, Japanese-American businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle who was working as a producer for Toei. A proposal was made: if Fukunaga could start an anime company in US, Toei would license the rights to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Ball</a> franchise to it – a franchise that was already making mad cash in Japan. Sensing an opportunity, Fukunaga found investors, and thus in 1994 Funimation was born. A year later, Dragon Ball was on US TV, dubbed and edited to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060518193827/http://www.animecauldron.com/dbzuncensored2/misc/footsteps.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“conform to American sensibilities and tastes”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" alt=\"Promotional art for the Dragon Ball Z anime, featuring some of its cast members.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>It was especially  (1989-1996) that hit it big in the US.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the early 2000s, fueled by Dragon Ball’s success, Funimation started expanding its business by getting home video distribution rights for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">4Kids Entertainment</a> licenses and non-Japanese kids’ cartoons, the latter eventually expanding into getting involved in production too. But beyond increased investment in kids’ cartoons, <strong>Funimation also started experimenting with more anime licenses of its own,</strong> the 2001 anime adaption for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fruits Basket</a> being one of its early standout releases.</p><p>Out of these various expansion attempts, <strong>“more anime” seemed to be the one to work out best,</strong> and towards the end of the 00s that became the main direction of Funimation’s business. This move was helped along by a bunch of licenses obtained from now-defunct US anime publishers Geneon USA and ADV. And in the spring of 2009, hot on the heels of Crunchyroll going legit, <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-03/funimation-adds-toei-air-master-captain-harlock\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation announced that they too were getting into the anime streaming business</a>. The resulting anime streams from Funimation were hardsubbed and looked like this:</p><p>What you see here is exactly what you got: plain text at top center or bottom center, with dialogue on bottom, and translations for all on-screen text piled up top. <strong>So while overlaps were technically supported, full positioning did not seem to be possible,</strong> which made things quite awkward the moment there was more than one sign visible on the screen at the same time. <strong>This was also the standard you could expect from Funimation’s DVD and Blu-ray releases.</strong> And beyond the way too common dialogue three-liners (which are generally terrible for readability), sometimes you even saw :</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot from  (Winter&nbsp;2014, Funimation)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The subtitling software that Funimation was using at the time was <a href=\"https://www.telestream.net/captioning/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Telestream MacCaption</a>.

However, it is worth mentioning that <strong>Funimation dubs did have simple hardsubbed typesetting sometimes;</strong> this only seemed happen at the whim of the dubbing side of Funimation though, as these hardsubbed signs were never present in the subbed versions, nor were they a consistent feature of Funimation dubs in general.</p><p><strong>In 2017, Sony purchased Funimation</strong> as part of its growing collection of international anime distributors (Sony had previously bought Madman Anime and AnimeLab in Australia and Wakanim in Europe). As a result of this buyout, towards the end of 2018 the license sharing deal between Funimation and Crunchyroll was dissolved and soon after <strong>Funimation started serving new subtitled streams on FunimationNow, which were softsubbed</strong> and looked like this:</p><p><strong>No longer were the subtitles even making use of overlaps.</strong> Where dialogue translation used to go on bottom and sign translation on top when both were present, now all text was stuck on the same side of the screen together, either on top or bottom, but never both at the same time anymore.</p><p>How this further reduction in subtitling capabilities came about cannot be said for sure, but there are several possible explanations. For one, another major thing that happened at the end of 2018: <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-12-04/funimation-hulu-sign-first-look-streaming-deal-for-new-anime/.140359\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation signed a big sublicensing deal</a> with the general streaming service <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu</a>, which meant <strong>dealing with Hulu’s subtitling standards and authoring accordingly limited subtitles</strong> – because as could be expected, the subtitling standards of a general streaming service did not account for the needs of anime in any real way.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Only the middle column of the blackboard is translated here.

Screenshot from  (Fall&nbsp;2019, Funimation/Hulu)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Another possible reason for these less-than-great changes in Funimation’s subtitling standards was that around this time the company <strong>started using the cloud-based subtitling toolkit OOONA Tools</strong> by the localization service provider <a href=\"https://www.ooona.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OOONA</a>. OOONA Tools, by default, <strong>do not allow for the creation of subtitles with overlaps.</strong> While it can be done in OOONA today by tweaking the options or by using OOONA’s track features (which are quite similar to those of MacCaption, incidentally), it is possible that at the time these features were either not available or that it wasn’t possible to correctly export subtitles with overlaps to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebVTT subtitle format</a> that was being used on FunimationNow.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot of , the primary subtitling software in OOONA Tools.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding that last possibility in particular, there is <a href=\"https://archive.is/nRpg1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this OOONA FAQ entry</a> that mentions how <q>not all formats support […] overlapping subtitles</q> and that <q>Currently, it’s supported in IMSC1.1, ITT and Videotron Lambda CAP exports</q>. However, based on my own testing, OOONA Tools can properly export subtitles with overlaps in more formats today than just the ones mentioned here (including WebVTT), meaning that the FAQ entry is in fact outdated – <strong>but it was likely true at some point.</strong></p><p>In any case, this was the extremely limited standard of subtitling that Funimation customers had to live with until the service was shut down in 2024 as a result of the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><p>Now, what can we conclude from all this? If nothing else, one thing seems abundantly clear: <strong>the Funimation leadership never truly cared about or respected anime as a medium.</strong> From the very beginning, it’s clear that Gen Fukunaga (a businessman in his 30s at the time) got into the business <strong>with the mindset of making money with kids’ cartoons,</strong> and this only became more evident with how Funimation tried to expand into more types of kids’ cartoons before eventually realizing that anime is where the money was at.</p><p>But even with this eventual focus on more anime, <strong>no resources seem to have ever been dedicated to make typesetting an actual thing at Funimation,</strong> despite how obviously beneficial it would have been for their key product of localized anime. And the way Funimation never even bothered to figure out how to make the most of MacCaption, the expensive enterprise subtitling software they kept using for over a decade… while I speculated about possible technical reasons for Funimation abandoning even overlaps when they started producing softsubs for FunimationNow, there was always one possible additional reason: <strong>they just didn’t care at all.</strong> They ran into a problem, no resources were dedicated to fix the problem, and the subtitles got permanently worse as a result.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Remember the fansubbed version of this from earlier? Here’s Funimation in comparison. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, Funimation)</figcaption></figure><p>The whole move to OOONA was questionable in itself, as while OOONA was capable of exporting subtitles to both WebVTT for FunimationNow and TTML (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SRT</a>, a very limited subtitle format) for Hulu in 2018,  Why start paying for a monthly subscription service when your existing paid-for enterprise software should be able to deal with your needs just fine? I suspect the primary motivation behind the move (which could have even originated from the new parent company Sony) might have been the fact that it was trendy for companies at the time to move everything they possibly could to The Cloud™, regardless of how much sense it actually made… but that’s enough about OOONA for now.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>Funimation’s subtitling standards were extremely poor to begin with, and they only managed to make them worse over time.</strong> That is something that only utter indifference or outright disdain for anime as a medium could bring about, which seems to have been the exact attitude that Gen Fukunaga cultivated at the executive levels of Funimation – <strong>and his followers appear to have carried the torch even after his departure from the company.</strong> But more on that in the next section, when we finally get to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><h2>The Funimation-Crunchyroll merger and its consequences</h2><p>Following Sony’s 2017 purchase of Funimation, in 2019 Sony bought out Gen Fukunaga from the company entirely, which led to him stepping down as the General Manager, with Colin Decker taking his place. Soon after, Sony formed the Funimation Global Group to consolidate all the international anime publishing services it had bought, with Decker in charge of the joint venture as the CEO. Then, in late 2020, <strong>Sony announced that they were going to buy Crunchyroll, placing it under the executive control of the Funimation Global Group.</strong> The acquisition was completed in August 2021, coming with a statement from Sony that their goal is to <a href=\"https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2021/0809/sonysfunimationglobalgroupcompletesacquisitionofcrunchyrollfromatt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" alt=\"Crunchyroll and Funimation logos side by side.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Soon, there would only be one.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in March 2022, the news came that Funimation, Crunchyroll, Wakanim, and VRV (Crunchyroll’s more general streaming service) would all be merged together into a single streaming service that would exist under the name of Crunchyroll (as it had the strongest brand of the lot). <strong>Funimation Global Group LLC was renamed to Crunchyroll LLC, with Funimation executives remaining in charge.</strong> Soon after, Colin Decker stepped down as the CEO, with Rahul Purini (previously COO) taking his place. The merger was complete.</p><p>Things weren’t much better for those left behind, as laid out in <a href=\"https://archive.ph/jxvFK\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this Bloomberg article</a> from 2024. Staff from Funimation was notably hostile towards those from Crunchyroll:</p><blockquote><p>Tension between the camps arose almost immediately. In a Zoom meeting announcing [Sony’s purchase of Crunchyroll], <strong>Funimation workers accused Crunchyroll of being pirates,</strong> alluding to the site’s history, according to two people who were present.</p></blockquote><p>While Crunchyroll workers were quickly frustrated with the new executives from Funimation:</p><blockquote><p>Current or former employees describe Crunchyroll’s new management–primarily from Funimation–as out-of-touch with employees and the anime fans the company once prioritized. <strong>Some executives write off anime as “kids’ cartoons,”</strong> they said, and resist hiring job candidates who describe themselves as fans.</p></blockquote><h3>How typesetting gets destroyed</h3><p>In 2025, the executives came up with an idea: Crunchyroll should move away from <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#aegisub-ass-introduction\">Aegisub and ASS subtitles with typesetting</a> and start producing exclusively <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ttml-example\">limited TTML subtitles without typesetting</a> in <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ooona-introduction\">OOONA Tools</a>. <strong>The likely end goal of this is to get rid of Crunchyroll’s <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-libass\">unique ASS-based subtitle rendering</a> entirely in favor of something more “industry standard” like TTML-based subtitle rendering.</strong> This would mean no longer having to pay staff for manual ASS-to-TTML conversion, as well as being able to drop the relatively expensive fully hardsubbed encodes for limited playback environments where ASS rendering is not possible <em>(but some sort of TTML rendering usually is).</em></p><p><strong>However, a major change affecting all aspects of the company’s subtitling pipeline doesn’t happen overnight,</strong> especially considering Crunchyroll’s large back catalog of ASS subtitles with typesetting that couldn’t be automatically converted to limited TTML subtitles without typesetting. So while the subtitling staff was to be (begrudgingly) busy experimenting and onboarding with OOONA and doing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions for back catalog titles, <strong>technical work would also need to be done to prepare for this vision of a TTML-only future.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>And what an exciting future of not being able to read signs that would be! Screenshot from <em>This Monster Wants to Eat Me</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>For this purpose, Crunchyroll seems to have decided that it would take its existing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions produced by the subtitling staff and treat them as the new master subtitle files. These TTML “masters” would then be—for the time being—converted back to ASS with <a href=\"https://www.closedcaptionconverter.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Closed Caption Converter</a> for use with the current ASS-based subtitle rendering. And so, with the start of the Fall 2025 anime season, a plan like this was pushed to production; while regular ASS subtitles were still being produced by Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff, <strong>these ASS subtitles with typesetting were generally left unused, while only limited ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS conversions without typesetting were being presented to customers on most shows.</strong></p><p>Implementing this interim pipeline with Closed Caption Converter didn’t seem to go exactly as planned, though, <strong>as some Fall 2025 shows on Crunchyroll ended up having no subtitles at all on release,</strong> including the premieres of the latest seasons of hit shows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">My Hero Academia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spy × Family</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems – not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved.</p><p>Quality subtitles are a core part of what makes watching anime on Crunchyroll so special. They connect global fans to the heart of every story, and we take that responsibility seriously.</p><p>Thank you for your patience. We’re committed to continuing to deliver the authenticity, quality, and care that fans deserve.</p></blockquote><p>Following this statement, some of the new Fall 2025 shows have had their ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles switched out to the previously unused regular ASS subtitles. Other shows haven’t. <strong>And some shows in the Crunchyroll back catalog have been updated with ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles,</strong> though the exact timing of these back catalog updates is unknown.</p><p>With all of this, <strong>the future of typesetting on Crunchyroll is unclear.</strong></p><p>And that’s how we’ve found ourselves in the situation we face today. Remember what the <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-first-subs\">first Crunchyroll subtitles from 2009</a> looked like? Yeah, these new subtitles adhering to limited TTML standards <em>are even worse than the subtitles from 2009</em> in terms of how on-screen text can be handled! In other words: <strong>The presentation quality of Crunchyroll’s first-party subtitles has reached an all-time low in 2025.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Can’t even handle a next episode preview properly anymore. Screenshot from <em>Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that: <strong>the Funimation-turned-Crunchyroll executives still do not have any respect for anime as a medium.</strong> In addition, they seem to be treating Crunchyroll and its ways of doing things as the ways of  – which isn’t entirely incorrect, as Crunchyroll’s use of Aegisub and ASS  originate from the ways of pirate fansubbers. But fansubbers deeply care about anime as medium (they wouldn’t be illegally subtitling it for free as a hobby otherwise), which in turn means that <strong>the ways fansubbers have developed to subtitle anime are in fact extremely efficient for the job</strong> – much better than basically any “industry standards” for subtitling, even.</p><p>But that clearly doesn’t matter to the executives. <strong>The only thing that seems to be on their mind is how to best make money with kids’ cartoons</strong> that none of them personally watch, and what they seem to consider “best” is <em>getting rid of everything positively unique about Crunchyroll in favor of doing things the Funimation way,</em> even if that means ditching Aegisub and ASS in favor of OOONA Tools and TTML and getting rid of typesetting in the process.  conclusion is further supported by the fact that  with notable reduction in typesetting quality on Blu-ray as a result:</p><p>Then there’s the whole plan of moving to OOONA in general, which is even more questionable than it was back in the Funimation days. <strong>Crunchyroll has a lot more to lose in terms of subtitle quality than Funimation ever did,</strong> yet the executives seem to want to go back to their “old reliable” regardless. I can’t even see it saving them any money in the long run, considering that Aegisub is completely free software while OOONA will incur constant ongoing costs with its per-user subscription pricing. Rather than authoring limited TTML in OOONA directly, <strong>paying the subtitling staff to keep the manual ASS to TTML conversions going would likely be cheaper!</strong></p><p>Beyond that, there is also the thing about <strong>OOONA being an Israeli company.</strong> It is certainly a choice, not only in 2018 but most certainly in 2025, to heavily invest in the services of a company from a country that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">actively committing genocide</a>. However, to quell some unsubstantiated internet discourse I have seen in relation to this, I do want to emphasize that <strong>OOONA being Israeli is not really directly relevant to the quality issues this article is about.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>EZTitles is another popular enterprise subtitling software. Notice how they mention AI directly in their navigation.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The reason for this lies in enterprise subtitling software (“industry standards”) being universally poor when it comes to producing high quality typesetting for anime, so it wouldn’t really matter which software suite a switch was being made to – <strong>no matter what, moving away from Aegisub would destroy typesetting as it currently exists on Crunchyroll.</strong> And while Crunchyroll’s CEO has expressed his interest in AI subtitles, at least currently there has been no signs of any kind of AI (Israeli or otherwise) being used to create first-party subtitles on Crunchyroll.</p><h3>Why Crunchyroll is so confident it will get away with this (or: how capitalism ruins everything)</h3><p>Finally, I want to talk about the possible reasons for Crunchyroll executives feeling so confident about getting away with making their own primary product so much worse. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that <strong>international anime licensing operates primarily on an exclusive licensing model.</strong> This means that generally only one service will be able to offer a specific title in specific language(s) in specific region(s), unless the service voluntarily decides to sublicense it out to others. This in turn upends the assumption that the existence of multiple anime services would be beneficial to consumers, <strong>as the services don’t actually have to engage in competition on customer-beneficial factors like service quality almost at all</strong> – instead, they can just focus on hoarding as many exclusive licenses as possible.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of three comments from a Reddit AMA. Check the link in the caption to read the contents in full.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>I once asked former Crunchyroll CEO Kun Gao about “exclusivity or completeness” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b26ou/im_kun_gao_the_cofounder_and_ceo_of_crunchyroll/cj12zuo/?context=3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in this Reddit AMA.</a> He dodged the question but basically said “exclusivity”.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This kind of “competition” twisted by exclusive licensing is more like a casino, where the customers might occasionally be thrown a bone, <strong>but at the end of the day, the house always wins.</strong> And the anime companies very much prefer to keep it that way, even if it means never being able to offer full coverage of new anime seasons – a limited amount of exclusives is much more important to them. Dreams of infinite growth are what drives the modern-day game of capitalism, and spending money to please customers rather than shareholders goes directly against said dreams. <strong>It’s all about spending as little money as possible to make as much money as possible.</strong></p><div><p>This is why the capitalists in charge of all the big companies these days are so excited about AI too: nothing gets them going more than the idea of not having for pay for those pesky human employees. <em>This is no doubt the actual reason why Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini is interested in AI subtitles.</em> It doesn’t matter that <em>anime localization costs are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall costs of anime production,</em> even if you were talking about super high quality work with fansub-level typesetting. <em>Any excuse to cut the wages of real human workers is one step closer to the next yacht purchase for the executive upper class.</em></p></div><p>…Whew, got a bit heated there. Anyway, the most likely reason why Crunchyroll executives believe they can get away with reducing the quality of their own service so much? <strong>Because Crunchyroll doesn’t have any meaningful competition thanks to the primarily-exclusive licensing model used by the international anime industry.</strong> Even if they make the service worse, what can you do about it?

project)","url":"https://github.com/dvir-biton/MyraOS","date":1761511420,"author":"dvirbt","guid":100747,"unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Hi HN, I’m Dvir, a young developer. Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.<p>This took me on the most interesting ride, where I’ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  I’ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.<p>I started by reading University books and online blogs, while also watching videos.  \nSome sources that helped me out were OSDev Wiki (<a href=\"https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page</a>), OSTEP (<a href=\"https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP</a>), open-source repositories like MellOS and LemonOS (more advanced), DoomGeneric, and some friends that have built an OS before.<p>This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! \nI began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:<p><pre><code>  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.\n  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).\n  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.\n  4) PMM (Physical memory management)\n  5) Paging and virtual memory management\n  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)\n  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  \n  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).\n     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,\n     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other\n     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.\n  9) Syscall support.\n  10) Libc implementation.\n  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.\n  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Club’s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.<p>At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.<p>Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would've never even thought about without participating in SoM.<p>This is my SoM project: <a href=\"https://summer.hackclub.com/projects/5191\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://summer.hackclub.com/projects/5191</a>.<p>Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.<p>The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.<p>Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldn’t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.<p>After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).<p>Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.<p>The repo is at <a href=\"https://github.com/dvir-biton/MyraOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dvir-biton/MyraOS</a>.

generation tools like Mermaid.js a lot for quickly drawing up things but for presentations or deliverables I find that I have to then move the generated diagrams over to a tool like Lucidchart which allows full control of the organization and customization.<p>Therefore I am now working on this to combine the benefits of both into just one tool which can do both functions.<p>The project is certainly in the early stages but if you find yourself making architecture diagrams I'd love to hear your thoughts on the idea or even a Github issue for a feature request!<p>One of the workflows I'm targeting is when an AI generates the first draft of the diagram (all the LLMs know .mmd syntax) and then the user can then customize it to their liking which I think can drastically speed up making complex diagrams!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706792\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706792</a></p>\n<p>Points: 249</p>\n<p># Comments:
