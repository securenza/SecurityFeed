In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel “Frauwudchat”:</p><blockquote><p>“Hi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API’s and programming.

In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar’s many aliases, posted to Exploit:</p><blockquote><p>Hello. I have access to a telecommunications company’s citrix and vpn.

Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it’s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.</p><p>It remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department’s website, along with the message:</p><blockquote><p>“Need irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either”</p></blockquote><p>Throughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar’s alias “Brad” (a.k.a. “Brad_banned”) frequently advertised Star Chat’s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker’s presence on a victim machine:</p><blockquote><p>We can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,\nbypass firewalls and have reverse shell access.</p><p>This shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!</p><p>Kernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.\nThis can range to simple shells to Bootkits.</p><p>Bypass all major EDR’s (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc)\nPatch EDR’s scanning functionality so it’s rendered useless!</p><p>Once implanted, extremely difficult to remove (basically impossible to even find)\nDevelopment Experience of several years and in multiple APT Groups.</p><p>Be one step ahead of the game.

Caesars <a href=\"https://www.courtwatch.news/p/how-the-fbi-tracked-down-the-15-million-caesars-casino-ransom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly paid a $15 million ransom</a> in that incident.</p><p>Within hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they’d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.</p><p>The Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.</p><p>In April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of “,” a lengthy screed detailing Jubair’s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-72224\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comcast-jubair.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"657\" height=\"507\"><p>Thalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.</p></div><p>More recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname “Operator,” which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts.

The complaint alleges the group’s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.</p><p>U.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair’s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.</p><p>The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation.

Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge case gave him more time than prosecutors requested because <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/sim-swapper-scattered-spider-hacker-gets-10-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account</a>.</p><div><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-71970\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kingbobtweets.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"485\"><p>Noah “Kingbob” Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.</p></div><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/urban-status-hack.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">court transcript</a> (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban’s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.</p><p> is chief research officer at the New York based security firm , and easily one of the world’s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.</p><p>In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing — and very often bragging about — serious cybercrime offenses.</p><p>“Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.”</p><p>Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they’re released.</p><p>Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.</p><p>“What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,” Nixon said. “The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.”</p><p>Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if&nbsp;the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.</p><p>“If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,” she said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/teenagers-charged-tfl-cyberattack-scattered-spider-trdhs5rwf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.</p><p>Jubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.</p><p>In the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy.
