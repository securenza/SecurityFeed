 In 2023 I tried out Codon. At the time I had difficulty compiling the scripts I most commonly used, but was excited by the prospect. Python is essentially single threaded and checks the shape (type) of each variable as it interprets scripts. Codon fixes types and compiles Python into compact, executable binaries that execute much faster. 

Several things have changed with their latest release: I have successful compiles, the committers have added a compiled version of NumPy (high performance math algorithms), and changed their open source license to Apache 2. 

"The other big news is that Exaloop, the company that is behind Codon, has changed their license to Apache 2..." according to the article, so "commercial use and derivations of Codon are now permitted without licensing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen - AP explains</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0ew-1dZ3_8</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x0ew-1dZ3_8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:09:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Susi Williams were stranded after the SpaceX capsule they travelled on suffered propulsion issues and returned home without them.  But a replacement crew have now docked with the orbital outpost. The mission even became a political issue with President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk falsely claiming the astronauts were abandoned in space by former US President Joe Biden.

And that alert reminds us that Medusa is a globe-spanning operation that recruits third-party affiliates to plant ransomware and negotiate with victims, notes the Register. "Even organizations that have good ransomware recovery regimes, meaning they don't need to unscramble encrypted data as they have good backups and fall-back plans, may consider paying to prevent the release of their stolen data, given the unpleasant consequences that follow information leaks.

Medusa actors also set a deadline for victims to pay ransoms and provide a countdown timer that makes it plain when stolen info will be sprayed across the internet. If victims cough up $10,000 in cryptocurrency, the crims push the deadline forward by 24 hours. 

The advisory reveals one Medusa actor has taken things a step further. "FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid," the advisory states. That separate actor then "requested half of the payment be made again to provide the 'true decryptor'," the advisory states, describing this incident as "potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme." 

The security groups' advisory stresses that they "do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations..." (But "Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents...) 

Besides updating software and operating systems, the alert makes these recommendations for organizations:

Require VPNs (or jump hosts) for remote network access
Block remote access from unknown/untrusted origins, and disable unused ports
 Segment networks to help prevent the spread of ransomware
Use a networking monitoring tool to spot and investigate abnormal activity — including lateral movement (using endpoint detection and response tools). Log all network traffic, and monitor it for unauthorized scanning and access attempts.
Create recovery plans with encrypted offline backups of sensitive/proprietary data and servers
Require multifactor authentication, use strong (and long) passwords, and "consider not requiring frequently recurring password changes, as these can weaken security." (Also audit access control following the principle of least privilege, and watch for new and/or unrecognized accounts.)
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SuperMuxer: tiny and compact, dependency-free package to configure your HTTP routes</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jcmfrb/supermuxer_tiny_and_compact_dependencyfree/</link><author>/u/FlairPrime</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:18:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Super  Go package to configure your HTTP routes using only the .

While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out—the hit on the Druzhba pipeline—creating international ripple effects beyond Russia’s borders as exports suddenly dropped.As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine’s strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia’s air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.What followed was Russia’s most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city’s largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disruptedExplosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force’s rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.The Druzhba pipeline—one of the world’s largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day—is a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, called it an attack on their sovereignty.When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia’s hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia’s nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia’s monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country’s electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.Ukraine’s strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?If Russia does not accept a ceasefire—at least in the air—Ukraine can exert much more pressure on Russia’s energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow’s main refinery, which supplies half the city’s energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia’s economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire—at least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine., we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.You could close this page.

Oceans last year reached their highest levels in three decades — with the rate of global sea level rise increasing around 35% higher than expected, according to a NASA-led analysis published Thursday... Last year's rate of average global sea level rise was 0.23 inches per year, higher than the expected 0.17 inches per year, NASA said in a news release. 

The rate of global sea level rise follows a trend of rapidly increasing rates over the past 30 years. From 1993 to 2023, the rate of global sea level rise doubled, increasing from 0.08 inches per year to 0.18 inches, another NASA-led study showed. Overall, the global sea level has climbed by 4 inches since 1993. 

More details from ABC News:

 Climate change was a major driver to an unexpected level of sea level rise in 2024, according to a new NASA analysis... The majority of the difference between predicted and actual sea level rise was attributed to thermal expansion — or the ocean waters expanding as they warm, researchers said. An unusual amount of ocean warming, combined with meltwater from land-based ice such as glaciers, led to the increase of sea level rise last year, according to NASA. 

About two-thirds of sea level rise in recent years has resulted from the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, with a third coming from thermal expansion, according to NASA. In 2024, those metrics flipped, with two-thirds of the rise attributed to expanding ocean water and one-third attributed to contributions from melting ice. "With 2024 as the warmest year on record, Earth's expanding oceans are following suit, reaching their highest levels in three decades," said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, head of physical oceanography programs and the Integrated Earth System Observatory at NASA... Human-amplified climate change is the primary cause for present-day rising sea levels, climate research shows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>K-Pop group MISAMO members throw first pitch at Dodgers vs Tigers game in Tokyo</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55J7v3WV-4s</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/55J7v3WV-4s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 11:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[K-Pop group MISAMO added some glamour to the start of the Los Angeles' Dodgers second exhibition game in Tokyo.

Git 2.49 is out today as the latest feature update for this widely-used distributed version control system.
Git 2.49 delivers faster packing via name-hash v2, a new "git backfill" tool to address any missing historical blobs, "git clone" learned to make a shallow clone for a single commit that is not necessarily at the tip of any branch, lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone, zlib-ng support preparations, and a foreign language interface for Rust has been added to the codebase.
This first bit of Rust code within Git introduces two new Rust crates: libgit-sys and libgit. Further work on Rust code within Git is being carried out for future Git releases.

That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement. In the last parliamentary elections in 2022, a united front of anti-Fidesz candidates fell well short of Orbán’s party, which won over half of the popular vote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI is Learning to Read DNA and Sound</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-ai-is-learning-to-read-dna-and-sound?source=rss</link><author>Rendering Technology Breakthroughs</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ sequence length warmup for these pretraining experiments.

This includes problems with popups and the need to create some widgets almost from scratch due to the lack of documentation and examples for what I consider basic components, such as an equivalent of GTK’s TreeView.Price — free, so take it for yourself, your friends, and your family.

The highway will ease traffic into the city, which will host over 50,000 people at the conference this November:
The state government touts the highway's "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact... Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side — a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém. 

Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area... The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife... 

The state government of Pará had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns. Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit. 
But on the bright side, Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, said the highway would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, as well as climate-friendly bike lanes and solar-powered lighting...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NASA’s stuck astronauts welcome their replacements to the space station</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBlKola5A40</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OBlKola5A40?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:30:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just over a day after blasting off, a SpaceX crew capsule arrived at the International Space Station on Sunday, delivering the replacements for NASA’s two stuck astronauts.

More users mean more queries per second, more concurrent connections, and larger datasets.If you don't scale your database to handle the increased load, it can  your app and cause problems.In this article we will explore the 15 Database Scaling Techniques to ensure your application keeps operating at optimal performance without the database becoming a bottleneck., also known as , is the process of increasing the capacity of a single database server by adding more resources—CPU, RAM, disk storage, or network bandwidth. – You replace the existing machine with a higher-capacity one. This might involve switching to a server with more CPU cores, higher memory, or better disk performance (e.g., moving from HDDs to NVMe SSDs).Increasing Resource Allocations – If you're using a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), you can resize instances dynamically. For example, upgrading from an AWS RDS  instance to a  instance.Database Engine Optimizations – Tuning configurations such as increasing buffer pool size in MySQL () or allocating more shared memory in PostgreSQL (). – Moving from traditional HDDs to SSDs or leveraging NVMe storage to reduce disk I/O bottlenecks.When Should You Consider Using Vertical Scaling?When your workload fits within the limits of a single machine and you want  without introducing the complexity of distributed databases.When , and distributing queries across multiple nodes introduces unwanted overhead.When your application is still , and horizontal scaling (sharding or replication) is unnecessary.When you need a quick and cost-effective solution in the short term without redesigning the system architecture.Limitations of Vertical Scaling – There's a ceiling to how much you can scale a single machine. Even the largest cloud instance has limits. – A vertically scaled database is a single machine. If it crashes, everything goes down unless there's a failover mechanism.Expensive Beyond a Certain Point – The cost of high-end machines grows exponentially. A top-tier AWS RDS instance can cost thousands of dollars per month. – Increasing CPU, memory, or disk space often requires downtime, especially in on-premise setups.Vertical scaling is simple, effective, and easy to implement, making it a great first step for scaling a database. However, as traffic grows, a single machine will eventually hit a hard limit, forcing a move toward horizontal scaling techniques like sharding or replication. is a technique used to speed up database queries by creating a data structure that allows for faster lookups. Instead of scanning the entire table to find relevant rows, an index acts like a  in a book—helping the database locate data quickly.Imagine searching for a word in a dictionary. Without an index, you’d have to read every page. But with an alphabetically sorted index, you can jump directly to the correct section. That’s exactly how a database index works.Creating an index on a single column that is frequently used in  clauses. Example:CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);An index on multiple columns, useful when queries filter by multiple conditions. Example:CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);When Should You Consider Using Indexing?When queries frequently  by a specific column (, , ).When performing  on large tables.When optimizing , where fast lookups are more critical than fast writes. – Every , , or  operation must also update the index, increasing overhead. – Indexes consume additional disk space, sometimes larger than the actual table.Not Useful for Every Query – If a query retrieves a large portion of the table, an index may not help and could even slow it down. – Too many indexes can slow down performance instead of improving it. Choosing the right indexes is key.Indexing is one of the most powerful ways to scale a database without adding more hardware. However, it requires careful planning. The  can improve query performance by orders of magnitude, while  can slow down writes and waste storage. is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a  to reduce database load and improve response times. Instead of repeatedly querying the database for the same data, applications can retrieve it from a , which is significantly faster.There are multiple caching strategies (read through, cache aside, write back etc.,) each suited for different use cases.The  pattern is widely used because it gives the application full control over caching logic.When a client requests data, the application first checks the cache.If the data exists in cache (), it is returned instantly.If data is not found (), it is fetched from the database, stored in the cache for future requests, and returned to the client.Content Delivery Network (CDN) CachingFor web applications, static content (images, videos, scripts) is cached at CDN edge servers, reducing database and server load.When Should You Consider Using Caching?When the same data is frequently accessed, such as user profiles, product catalogs, or search results.When you need , especially for real-time applications.When your database is experiencing  and you want to reduce direct database queries.When serving  like images, CSS, and JavaScript in web applications. – If the cache is not updated when the database changes, users might see outdated information.Cache Invalidation Complexity – Deciding when to refresh or expire cached data is challenging. – Caching requires additional memory (RAM), which can be expensive at scale.Not Ideal for Write-Heavy Applications – Since caches mainly optimize read performance, write-heavy applications don’t benefit as much.Caching is one of the most effective database scaling techniques because it reduces query load and improves response times. However, it requires careful cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Decoding JSON sum types in Go without panicking</title><link>https://nicolashery.com/decoding-json-sum-types-in-go/</link><author>/u/FoxInTheRedBox</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:42:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Go programming language doesn't have native support for sum types, but we'll see how we can emulate them, how to decode and encode them into JSON, and how in some cases they can help avoid runtime panic exceptions.Whether we find them useful or not, sum types existMany languages support sum types natively: Zig, TypeScript, OCaml, Rust, just to name a few. Even OpenAPI has them, the de-facto standard and language-agnostic way to define HTTP APIs using JSON. So even if the programming language you're using doesn't natively support sum types, you may still need to handle a JSON payload over the wire that is modeled as one. This requires deciding how to decode that payload in your language of choice.Personal feelings about sum types aside, I think most people would agree they effectively model data structures that can be "one of these (potentially very different) things, and nothing else". And once you've experienced sum types with a  or match expression combined with , it's hard to go back.Let's take a primitive type, a boolean or  in Rust. It has 2 possible values:  or  (also called "cardinality"). A struct or record is called a  because you can count the number of possible values (or cardinality) by  the number of possible values of each field. So if I have a struct with 2 boolean fields (example here in Rust):
    signed_up
    subscribedThe number of possible values for this struct (or "product type") is: 2x2 = .Now I didn't choose this struct example completely at random. Some of the possible values are not valid in this particular domain: a user can't be  if they are not  as well. You'll also hear the phrase "make illegal states unrepresentable" when talking about sum types.A  is called that way because... you guessed it. You can count the number of possible values (or cardinality) by  the number of possible values of each branch. So if I have the following sum type (example still in Rust, where they are called "enums"): subscribedThe number of possible values for this "sum type" is: 1+2 = .I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to discuss and decide which of these two data structures is better adapted for representing this particular domain.My first nil pointer panic in Go was due to lack of sum typesOk, that section title is a bit cheeky and probably not entirely true. But when I figured out what caused the panic in my code, the thought "sum types would've caught this at compile time"  cross my mind. I'm sure the astute reader could find better ways to structure my first implementation, even without sum types. But humor me for the sake of this article.Let me say it now: This is  one of those "Go should have sum types" post. A lot has already been written on the topic and I don't want to get into the debate (although you'll probably guess where I stand). Let's just assume I want to  something like sum types in Go, then:How do I do so without straying too far from what's idiomatic in the language?How do I encode and decode it, to and from JSON, with the structure we'll see below?This post is also  a criticism of Go. I came across this issue in my first Go project, and I actually enjoyed working with the language. Having shied away from Go for a while (notably because of lack of sum types), I finally gave it a try because it seemed a good fit for this project. The fast compile times, robust standard library, simplicity of the language, and great developer tooling all delivered on their promise.For the anecdote, the first time I ran  was on the sample codebase from Alex Edward's "Let's Go Further" book (excellent book by the way), and I had to run it again because it was so much faster than what I was used to ( Haskell ), I thought nothing had happened.Back to the historical context: I'm feeling very productive with Go on this particular project. The feedback loop is amazing, and I have a working proof-of-concept in just a couple of days. Code seems to just slip from my fingers, everything works on the first try, zero values and pointers do not scare me anymore, I just need to add this last thing and... then it hits me:2024/12/07 12:16:53 http: panic serving [::1]:60984:

    /Users/nicolashery/dev/example/main.go:157 +0x20c
[...]Ouch. Having done a lot of Haskell and (strict) TypeScript recently, I had forgotten one could get such runtime errors. But I don't panic (pun intended), and I carefully look at the code mentioned in the stack trace.Below is a simplified version of the code for the sake of this article (the actual implementation had bigger structures and more cases). Can you spot the error? You have 5 seconds.a Action result  aType  ActionType_CreateObject
		result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_UpdateObject
		result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_DeleteObject
		result  fmt aObjectID ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		result  result
Ok, obviously you'll want to  on  to see what it is: Action 
	Type   ActionType 
	Object Object    
	ID     object Object Action  Action
		Type   ActionType_CreateObject
		Object objectobject Object Action  Action
		Type   ActionType_UpdateObject
		Object objectid  Action  Action
		Type ActionType_DeleteObject
		IDid Action  Action
		Type ActionType_DeleteAllObjectsDid you see the error? If yes, then you can stop reading now and get back to work. I'm joking. Didn't see it in the allowed time limit? Don't worry, the Go type checker couldn't either.Decoding JSON sum types in Go, take oneHow did I get to the code above, you might wonder? Well, imagine our service is receiving a JSON payload that looks like this:These are all different types of "actions", and this JSON representation is not unreasonable. The OpenAPI specification has a discriminator "pet" example, and the Redocly documentation a "vehicle" example, that are similar to this. (I have yet to come across an API with pets so apologies my example will be the less fun, but maybe more realistic.)My naive attempt to decode this JSON, because I was in a rush (and maybe also because Copilot suggested it, if I'm being honest), was to create a struct which I call . This is a struct with all possible fields for every action type merged, and using pointers. The zero-value of pointers is  which will be set for fields that are "unused" by a particular action type. Here it is in all its glory: Action 
	Type   ActionType 
	Object Object    
	ID      ActionType 
	ActionType_CreateObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_UpdateObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_DeleteObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_DeleteAllObjects ActionType This works because  doesn't care if there are missing fields in the JSON payload, it will just set the zero-value for them:actions Action err  jsondataactions err  err
We can also go the other way and call  to encode the struct into the same JSON representation as the snippet above. The  struct tag option will remove fields unused by each action type from the resulting JSON.So we're off to the races, what can go wrong with a bag of pointers? Subtle bugs when trying to access a field that is  because unused by that action type, that's what: aType  ActionType_CreateObject
	result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_UpdateObject
	result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_DeleteObject
	result  fmt aObjectID ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
	result How do OpenAPI and Protobuf handle this?I pick myself up after this runtime panic, and have the following genius idea: There are code generators for OpenAPI, if I give them the specification for the JSON discriminated union above, what do they output for Go? Also, Protocol Buffers is a popular wire format that is based on code generation, and the Oneof field looks a lot like a sum type, so what do  generate for Go?The OpenAPI schema for an action would look like this: object
   type
     object
   string
    If I feed this to the OpenAPI Generator (note that I'm using the useOneOfDiscriminatorLookup=true option for better output), I get what I'll call a "bag of all the branches": Action 
	createObject     CreateObject
	updateObject     UpdateObject
	deleteObject     DeleteObject
	deleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjects
 CreateObject 
	Object Object It generates an  method for  that:first decodes the JSON to check the  field (this is thanks to the useOneOfDiscriminatorLookup=true codegen option)according to the value of , it chooses the appropriate branch and decodes the JSON using the corresponding struct (, , etc.)Edited for clarity, it looks something like this:a Actiondata  tagged 
		Type ActionType  err  jsondatatagged err  err
	 err  taggedType  ActionType_CreateObject
		err  jsondataacreateObject ActionType_UpdateObject
		err  jsondataaupdateObject ActionType_DeleteObject
		err  jsondataadeleteObject ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		err  jsondataadeleteAllObjectsTo get the actual underlying value, the generator creates a method (which I'll name  here) that returns the first non-nil pointer:a Action any  acreateObject  acreateObject
	 aupdateObject  aupdateObject
	 adeleteObject  adeleteObject
	 adeleteAllObjects  adeleteAllObjects
	So this is already a big improvement on my  approach. Since the accessor method to the underlying value returns , I'm now checking the  which can be one of the more precise structs (, , etc.):action Action result  v  actionCreateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameUpdateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameDeleteObject
		result  fmt vIDDeleteAllObjects
		result  result
Some issues remain though:I "trust" the  return value of the accessor method to be one of the action structs (, , etc.) and nothing elseIf I add a "branch" (i.e. another action type), I can easily forget to update the  statement in Another generator that I tried out, oapi-codegen, uses a slightly different approach. It holds on to a  and delays the decoding until we call an equivalent of the  accessor method: Action 
	union jsonRawMessage
 CreateObject 
	Type   
	Object Object a Actionany errThe decoding works essentially the same, first decode enough to check the  field, then according to its value unmarshal into one of the action structs (, , etc.). The  documentation actually has a similar example.Since delaying JSON decoding wasn't particularly useful in my case, I didn't choose this route. But I wanted to mention it for completeness' sake.What about  (aka "Protobuf")? I found the following particularly interesting in their Go generated code guide:For a oneof field, the protobuf compiler generates a single field with an interface type . It also generates a struct for each of the singular fields within the oneof. These all implement this  interface.Let's try it out. Even though we're working with a JSON API, a Protobuf definition for our data model could look like this: value  create_object  update_object  delete_object  delete_all_objects  object The generated code indeed creates an interface  with a single method, as well as an  struct that holds a field with that interface type: Action 
	Value isAction_Value  isAction_Value  Action_CreateObject 
	CreateObject CreateObject Action_CreateObjectNow these two code generators, OpenAPI and Protobuf, will be the inspiration for my second attempt at decoding the JSON sum type in a more type-safe way...Decoding JSON sum types in Go, take twoAfter a bit of searching on the topic of "Go sum types", I stumbled across this: go-check-sumtype. From the README:A typical proxy for representing sum types in Go is to use an interface with an unexported method and define each variant of the sum type in the same package to satisfy said interface. This guarantees that the set of types that satisfy the interface is closed at compile time.This "interface with an unexported method" (also called "sealed interface", or "marker interface") sounded like a reasonable way to do it. And it's also what the Protobuf codegen seems to be using.I replaced my single "bag of all the fields"  struct with a sealed interface  and a struct for each variant (, , etc.). Each variant struct implements the interface: IsAction  CreateObject 
	Object Object CreateObject UpdateObject 
	Object Object UpdateObject DeleteObject 
	ID DeleteObject DeleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjectsNow I am quite pleased. Not only do these action-specific structs provide more type-safety, but if I forget to handle a variant in my  statement (or if I add a new one that implements the sealed interface), the  linter will catch it instead of getting an error at runtime!action Action result  v  actionCreateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameUpdateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameDeleteObject
		result  fmt vIDDeleteAllObjects
		result  result
I still needed to figure out how to decode the JSON sum types payload into this interface and structs. You can't unmarshal into an interface value directly, you need to pass a concrete type. So I created a wrapper struct like so: Action 
	value IsAction
I also found the exhaustive linter, so why stop at sum types when you can also have enums! I defined one for action types, which are used as "tags" in my tagged union, along with the proper methods for JSON and string representations: ActionType 
	ActionType_CreateObject ActionType 
	ActionType_UpdateObject
	ActionType_DeleteObject
	ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
t ActionTypet ActionTypedata t ActionTypeI then defined  for my  wrapper struct like so:a Actiondata  tag 
		Type ActionType  err  jsondatatag err  err
	 v IsAction
	 tagType  ActionType_CreateObject
		v CreateObject ActionType_UpdateObject
		v UpdateObject ActionType_DeleteObject
		v DeleteObject ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		v DeleteAllObjects err  jsondata v err  err
	

	avalue  v
	This works similarly to what we saw in the OpenAPI generated code:first decode only what is needed in the JSON to check the  fieldsecond, according to the value of , choose the appropriate variant struct of the sum type (, , etc.) and use it to decode the JSON payloadFor the other way around, I also defined  for the wrapper struct:a Action
	v  avalue

	data err  jsonv err  err
	 tagged any
	 err  jsondatatagged err  err
	 vCreateObject
		tagged ActionType_CreateObject
	UpdateObject
		tagged ActionType_UpdateObject
	DeleteObject
		tagged ActionType_DeleteObject
	DeleteAllObjects
		tagged ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
	 jsontaggedfirst encode the wrapped interface as JSON (unlike decoding, we can do this because the interface here will be initialized with an underlying concrete type: , , etc.)second, to add the tag in the  field, we do a roundtrip: decode into a , add the tag to that map, and re-encode the map into JSONNotice that I use the  linter in  to make sure I handle all possible tags, and I use the  linter in  to make sure I handle all possible variant structs. So given I keep the "enum" and "sum type" up-to-date, I will have exhaustiveness checking in both these methods (in addition to other methods or functions, such as  we saw earlier).That's it! Yes, there is a bit of boilerplate, but if one is using Go they are probably already OK with a little boilerplate here and there. Also, between AI coding assistants and other codegen tools, the cost of boilerplate can be mitigated. And finally there is that thing we say, "code is read (and maintained) much more often than written"? So I'd argue the added type-safety and the fact that we catch issues at compile time instead of runtime may be worth the tradeoff.Alternative implementationsOf course, the implementation described above is only  of decoding JSON sum types in Go. Below are a couple alternatives, some of which we've already mentioned. Action 
	createObject     CreateObject
	updateObject     UpdateObject
	deleteObject     DeleteObject
	deleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjects
 Action 
	payload jsonRawMessage
With the "sealed interface" approach I ended up using, I also considered an implementation of  that doesn't require an encode/decode roundtrip to add the tag, at the cost of a bit more boilerplate. It uses struct embedding instead (full example here):a Action data  err  v  avalueCreateObject
		tagged 
			Type ActionType 
			CreateObject
		
			Type         ActionType_CreateObject
			CreateObjectv
		data err  jsontagged data err
Finally, it is worth mentioning that there are different ways to represent sum types in JSON, notably: (the one used in this article): {"type": "delete_object", "id": "1", "soft_delete": true}: {"type": "delete_object", "value": {"id": "1", "soft_delete": true}}: {"delete_object": {"id": "1", "soft_delete": true}}The naming is taken from the Rust library Serde's documentation, which provides a good explanation and examples for each representation.All JSON representations are possible with the Go implementation of sum types described in this post (you can find the adjacently tagged full example here).What Go could have been: V lang?I'll let the project's website do its own marketing:V is very similar to Go. If you know Go, you already know ≈80% of V.[...] V is very similar to Go, and its domain is similar to Rust's [...]Wait... The simplicity of Go, but with enums and sum types? Yes, please!I tried porting my example to V, and I have to admit it works out quite nicely (full source here):
	user
	group

	id   
	name 
	object Object

	object Object

	id  CreateObject  UpdateObject  DeleteObject  DeleteAllObjects

action Action action 
		CreateObject 
		UpdateObject 
		DeleteObject 
		DeleteAllObjects The  expression has exhaustiveness checking, of course. And the  sum type decodes from/encodes to JSON right out-of-the box (with the caveat that, at the time of writing, it uses the adjacently tagged representation with no way of configuring it).Before getting too excited it is worth noting that V is very much a niche language, and can't be compared to Go's popularity and ecosystem. Our industry works in mysterious ways, who knows why some languages gain traction while others don't. Also, this might have some truth to it:There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming LanguageNevertheless, I found the V language interesting! It's a garbage-collected language that seems to have found a sweet spot between Go's simplicity and Rust's powerful type system.Examples in other languagesIf you made it this far, I'll leave you with a link to this repository. It contains an implementation of the example sum type from this article, with JSON encoding/decoding (where applicable), in the following languages:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Debian point release 12.10.....if you care and use.</title><link>https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250315</link><author>/u/unixbhaskar</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:42:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Debian project is pleased to announce the tenth update of its

I own a steamdeck and use their storefront, and have bought many games from them. However, as a linux user, over the years I've developed a strange feeling about their linux push. So, first thing thats crossed my mind is their main selling point in the space, Proton (and by proxy, wine). The whole idea is running windows applications and specifically games on linux. But that doesn't really feel like a long term solution. It basically requires that anything to do with gaming necessarily depends on windows and its systems. If people just stopped making windows builds of their stuff then linux gaming would suffer just as much.You would think that by now they would have tried to address this, and while I know the classic XKCD joke of "14 Competing Standards" rings here, but Valve has the best chance out of everyone to try, even if it fails, they'd still ideally have wine to fall back on.My second question is more to do with their lack of any movement outside of gaming. Don't get me wrong, they are a  platform and gaming focused developer. I'm not expecting them to shoulder the whole of the desktop on their shoulders, but it would be a serious feather in their cap to directly advertise that their software can do more then  gaming. The whole desktop mode of their flagship distro is fully featured just like any other.Third question, and this is more of a plea for context if it exists then a question, have they said anything about their long term goals anywhere, because I haven't heard anything. I'd love to know if they do actually have a roadmap, if only to know how to set my expectations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask Slashdot: Where Are the Open-Source Local-Only AI Solutions?</title><link>https://ask.slashdot.org/story/25/03/16/015209/ask-slashdot-where-are-the-open-source-local-only-ai-solutions?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 03:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Why can't we each have our own AI software that runs locally," asks long-time Slashdot reader BrendaEM — and that doesn't steal the work of others.

This post is going to be all about it. It’s the tale of a tad bit of an obsession, what felt like a hopeless search, and how persistence eventually paid off. There’s still an unsolved mystery too, so I’m hoping others will see this and help to fill in the blanks!The LC 550’s Secret PartitionIf Apple’s programmers, in creating the Performa series, were aiming to make idiot-proof computers, they were serious about it. The Performa 550 is an amazing case in point. When you run the included Apple Backup program (see Chapter 15), you get a little surprise that you didn’t count on: a  on your hard drive!This invisible chunk of hard drive space contains a miniature, invisible System Folder. Apple’s internal memo explains it this way:“When a system problem (one that prevents the Performa from booting) is detected, a [dialog box] informs the user of a system problem. The user can choose to fix the problem manually or to reinstall software from the backup partition’s Mini System Folder.”If you choose to reinstall your System software, you get the wristwatch cursor for a moment while the miniature System Folder is silently copied to your main hard-drive partition. The Performa restarts from the restored hard drive, and the invisible system partition disappears once again.We got a Performa team member to admit that this kind of sneaky save-the-users-from-themselves approach may well be adopted in other Performa models.Who knows what goodness lurks in the hearts of men?Cool! Although I have owned my own copy of this book for decades, I had no recollection of ever reading this little blurb. The book, if you’re curious, is Macworld Mac Secrets by David Pogue and Joseph Schorr. I found this whole functionality very intriguing, particularly because I had what felt like a very personal connection to it: the very first Mac that my family had when I was growing up was a Performa 550. I don’t think I have any pictures from back then, but in the meantime I’ve acquired one that looks exactly identical, so here’s a (slightly blurry) view of the type of machine I’m talking about in this post:I know that many people think the LC/Performa 5xx case style is ugly, but I really like it! I’m definitely biased though.This is an early model manufactured in September of 1993, which came with a caddy-loading CD-ROM drive (AppleCD 300i). Like other Macs from the same era, newer versions from 1994 came with a tray-loading drive instead (AppleCD 300i Plus). For comparison, here’s a photo of a late-model Performa 550 with a manufacture date of March 1994 that re4mat kindly gave me permission to share here:Pierre asked me if I had a copy of Apple’s software restoration CD for the Performa 550, and if I knew how to get it working in an emulator in order to try out this special functionality. I pointed him to a download link for the Performa CD for the 500 Series, version 7.1P6:If you weren’t using multimedia computers in the early 1990s, you might not recognize the weird rectangular container that this CD is enclosed inside of. It’s a CD caddy, and it’s what was used for inserting CDs into computers like the first one pictured above. You would open the caddy by squeezing the top right and bottom right ends toward each other, stick the disc into it, close it, and then push it into the slot in the computer, similarly to how you would insert a floppy disk. I really don’t miss these things one bit!Back to the story, though. I also gave Pierre some tips for using the restore CD in an emulator. Nowadays, my advice is outdated because it’s much easier to use Apple restore CDs in at least one emulator — MAME has come a long way in the last few years. He figured out a bunch more stuff on his own after that, including trying it in his own Performa 450 (not 550), but the bottom line was that the recovery partition was nowhere to be found.Well, sort of. He found that the process of restoring from the CD actually did create a recovery partition. Here’s a screenshot of the partitioning from inside of Apple HD SC Setup while booted from the Performa CD, after formatting the hard drive by clicking the Initialize button in the main window:As you can see, there’s a 2,560 KB partition of type Apple_Recovery almost at the end of the drive, just after the main partition named “Hard Disk”. This was promising at first glance, but the partition was empty! Further testing revealed that the custom Performa-specific version of Apple HD SC Setup (7.2.2P6) bundled on the CD was responsible for creating it, but didn’t actually populate it with any data. Apple Backup also didn’t put anything onto the partition, despite what the book said. I even looked through my past disassemblies of the Apple Backup and Apple Restore code and confirmed that there was nothing related to creating a recovery partition.The conclusion at the time was that someone needed to get ahold of a Performa 550 that still had its original hard drive and had never been reformatted. That’s where this story sat for 3 years. A few months ago, I remembered this whole situation and decided that I really wanted to try to find this partition. After all, the clock had always been ticking. The longer we waited, the fewer and fewer original Performa 550s would be out there in the wild. Not to mention that hard drives go bad and people throw them out without knowing that it’s usually possible to recover data from drives of this era. I confirmed all of Pierre’s findings in MAME. I even tried using Apple Backup in case I missed something, but no, it didn’t do anything with the hidden recovery partition. An easy way to look at it is to manually edit the partition table in a hex editor and change the type from Apple_Recovery to Apple_HFS.After doing this and booting up, I found another hard drive icon on my desktop called Recovery Volume, but it was empty, just like Pierre said:Taking it a bit further, I tried recreating the recovery functionality myself. I copied a minimal system folder to the Recovery Volume, and then changed its type back to Apple_Recovery. This made it invisible again. Then I screwed up my main system folder and rebooted. Sure enough, it automatically came up with the Recovery Volume as the main boot volume.This proved that the mechanism for booting from the recovery partition worked; we were just missing the data that was supposed to be on it. I came to the same conclusion that Pierre had already reached: we needed to find a Performa 550 that had never been reformatted. In the meantime, I spent some time digging into archives of Apple’s old tech notes and found several more references to this functionality.Backup Partition Software-automatically detects corrupted system folders. When a bad System Folder is detected, the user is given the option to re-load another System Folder into their system.The Apple Backup application creates a backup recovery partition that allows the Performa to boot even when the System Software on the main hard drive has been corrupted. The partition is invisible to the user.There is no built-in limit to the number of times the backup partition can be used. However, the partition will be lost if the hard drive is re-formatted. At this time the backup partition is used only on the Performa 550.Performa 550: System Folder Created w/ Dinosaur Safari CD (8/94) — not that I needed any more proof of the recovery partition’s existence at this point, but I got a kick out of this one. It talks about how launching an educational game about dinosaurs accidentally caused the system to go into recovery mode. It provided a little more info about what would happen when the recovery dialog popped up:When I launch the Dinosaur Safari CD from Creative Multimedia, a dialog box appears telling me that my Performa computer is having trouble starting up. I only have two options Shutdown or Continue? Why?After reading these articles, I was very convinced that the recovery partition was a real thing that existed, but I was also pretty confident that Apple Backup wasn’t responsible for creating it, despite Apple claiming otherwise. I had already seen that the special build of Apple HD SC Setup was what actually created it, and plus, like I said earlier, I had looked closely into a disassembly of the version of Apple Backup supplied with the Performa 500 series restore CD. There was nothing that copied any files to another partition on the hard drive, at least not that I could see.Really, the most important thing I gained from this exercise was that the second tech note confirmed the need to find a Performa 550 that had never been reformatted. Also, if the first tech note was to be believed, it needed to have come with System 7.1P6. This could narrow the search even further — I know for a fact that earlier Performa 550 models came with 7.1P5, including my childhood one. The same tech note also pointed out that 7.1P6 was the first version to support the “AppleCD 300+”, which is referring to the tray-loading CD-ROM drive. Based on this information, it’s reasonable to deduce that all Performa 550s with a tray-loading CD-ROM drive would probably have originally come with at least System 7.1P6.There was only one thing left to try at this point: asking the Internet for help. I asked people everywhere I could think of: Tinker Different, 68kMLA (where Pierre had already asked), and various social media sites. I searched Reddit and found people who had posted in the past about having a 550, asking if they still had the hard drive. I think I scared some of them — at least one person deleted their post after I asked! To be honest, I can’t blame them. I can imagine how freaky it would be to hear from someone begging to look at my hard drive’s contents. I’m sure some people might think of it as crossing a line, but it’s not as crazy of an ask if it’s a machine they’ve received second-hand from someone else. Plus, I was very clear about exactly what I was looking for (and why).I asked a seller of a Performa 550 that had been sitting on eBay for a long time if they would be willing to sell me the hard drive separately. They weren’t interested. I even bought some random hard drives on eBay that definitely went with a 5xx-style case. These were easy to identify because this case style uses a unique adapter for plugging the drive into the chassis wiring harness when you slide it into place.What do I have to show for all of these eBay purchases? Well, after dumping them all with my ZuluSCSI in initiator mode, I can say that the one pictured above came from a Macintosh TV. I also found another one from an LC 575. Lastly, I bought yet another drive that the seller said came from a Performa 577. The Performa 577 one was funny — it had all the Mac mounting hardware on it, but when I dumped it, it turned out to be from an Atari TT or Falcon (not sure which). I’d love to hear the story of how it ended up with an LC 5xx drive sled and adapter on it! Needless to say, none of them had the elusive recovery partition. One particularly friendly eBay seller was even nice enough to show me a preview of a drive’s contents in HFSExplorer, which helped me determine that it wasn’t from a Performa.I almost began questioning my sanity at one point during this search. Multiple people initially told me that they thought I was confused about this whole thing. I pointed them toward Apple’s tech notes describing it. Were Pierre and I imagining this whole thing? Were Apple’s tech notes all a lie?The thing is, this whole functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that hadn’t been preserved!Someone who saw my post on Reddit mentioned that they had a Performa 550 and would check it out. It was a newer tray-loading model with a January 1994 manufacture date. Unfortunately, the Conner hard drive inside of it wouldn’t cooperate, and plus this person didn’t have anything capable of dumping the contents. Luckily for me though, they were totally comfortable with letting me borrow the drive and try to recover the data from it.To tie everything together, we have now reached the point in this story that I covered in my last post about hard drives with stuck heads. As I mentioned in that blog, I could not get this drive to do anything. It would just spin up, sit there for a while, spin down, and then make an annoying buzzing sound for a while, repeating that whole process over and over again.I tried all kinds of things. I nudged the head while the platters were spinning, inspected it with my thermal camera to see if any components were getting hot, and tried it at different temperatures — cold shortly after it arrived, and at room temperature later. The only thing I noticed was that when it was making the buzzing sound, one of the IRFD123 MOSFETs would get much hotter than normal: up near 100 degrees Celsius.I wasn’t really sure what to do with this information though. It just seemed wrong that the head wasn’t moving at all. That’s when I finally decided to inspect everything further inside the drive and noticed the head stack seemed like it was sticking to a rubber/plastic looking piece. The Kapton tape trick I figured out and showed off in the last post finally allowed me to dump the drive contents. If you didn’t catch it last time, here’s a video showing how it was stuck, along with a successful dump with the help of the tape:As soon as the drive imaging process completed, I powered everything off and anxiously opened the hard drive image file with my favorite hex editor (HxD):Boom! This drive had a recovery partition on it! Now, that didn’t necessarily mean anything. After all, I had already seen an empty partition created by Apple HD SC Setup on the Performa CD. Still, though, it was definitely promising. Here’s an interpretation of the data at the beginning of the entry in the partition table:50 4D = PM = Signature00 00 = Padding00 00 00 05 = 5 total partitions on the drive00 04 E2 60 = starting physical block of the partition (0x4E260 blocks = 0x9C4C000 bytes)00 00 14 00 = size of partition in blocks (0x1400 blocks = 0x280000 bytes = 2560 kilobytes)name = MacOSAlso, just like in the partition table created by the Performa CD that I had inspected earlier, there were four bytes “msjy” at an offset of 0x9C bytes into the partition table entry. No other partitions had any data at 0x9C. I wonder if these are a couple of developers’ initials hiding in there or something? Is it an acronym? “Make Steve Jobs Yodel”? I even asked ChatGPT to come up with a playful interpretation in the context of Macs in the mid-1990s. It suggested “My System Jammed Yesterday”, explaining it as a playful nod to the “chaotic charm” of the era’s extension conflicts and Sad Mac screens. I didn’t even mention anything about it involving OS recovery. Tell me how you really feel about old Macs, ChatGPT!Knowing that the partition was there, the next step was to look near the end of the dumped drive image in HxD. If the partition had any actual data stored, it would be very obvious because starting at 0x9C4C000 in the file, there would be actual data and not just a bunch of zeros.This is where I started to actually get excited. The partition contained boot blocks! This was obvious because of the starting signature of LK and all of the various system file names plainly visible. On the other hand, the recovery partition created by the Performa CD during testing had zeros at this location — no boot blocks.These boot blocks are identical to the main partition’s boot blocks, except for one very important difference: at 0x1A, the Pascal string containing the Finder name is “recovery” instead of “Finder” like you’d normally see. This means that if you boot from this partition, it will load a program named recovery instead of the usual Finder app you’d expect on most Mac OS installs.This was definitely something special that the restore CD was not capable of recreating. As I scrolled further down through the partition, it quickly became obvious that it actually had some files!Okay, now I was totally stoked! I booted up a copy of the imaged drive in MAME and immediately noticed that there was evidence that the recovery partition had definitely activated itself on this machine in the past: there was a folder named  on the desktop with a creation date in 2004, and the trash contained an app called Read Me Mini System Folder with the exact same date.I wanted to experience the automatic OS recovery process for myself without any customizations from the original owner of the machine this hard drive came from, so I used HxD to copy the entire 2,560 KB recovery partition onto the fresh hard drive image I had created by restoring from the Performa CD. This was easy because the Performa version of Apple HD SC Setup had created an empty recovery partition with the exact same size. Then I booted it up in MAME and dragged the System file out of my System Folder in order to intentionally mess it up. I had to turn off System Folder Protection in the Performa control panel first:This is the classic kind of mistake that would have normally left you with an unbootable system showing a floppy disk icon with a flashing question mark. Would Apple’s automatic Performa OS recovery save me from myself? I rebooted to see what would happen. Instead of seeing a flashing question mark, I saw a Happy Mac very briefly before the system rebooted itself again. Then another Happy Mac showed up, and this time, it looked like a normal boot, except no extension icons showed up at the bottom of the screen. It was definitely booting from the recovery partition. Eventually, I was greeted with this screen:Hooray! This was exactly the dialog box that Macworld Mac Secrets and Apple’s tech note had referred to. The recovery partition had been successfully rescued!Let’s walk through the rest of this feature. If you click Shut Down, obviously the machine turns itself off. But when it boots back up, the recovery partition doesn’t automatically kick in anymore. So you’re on your own to fix the problem by booting from the Performa CD or the Utilities floppy disk.On the other hand, clicking OK does exactly what the tech note describes. You get the wristwatch cursor for a few seconds, the system reboots, and then you are greeted with this amazing screen, complete with an ugly yellow desktop pattern. Shall we call it the yellow screen of shame? Notice that the Mini System Folder on the desktop is the active System Folder, because it has the special icon.Here are the rest of the pages in this Read Me Mini System Folder app:Aha! So it’s not entirely automatic, since you still have to manually drag the System, Finder, and System Enablers from the Mini System Folder back to your original System Folder. Still though, it’s a very handy solution that gives you a bootable machine when something goes wrong with your OS.If you just ignore these instructions and keep using the computer, you will be nagged with this Read Me on every boot because it lives inside the Startup Items folder of the Mini System Folder. The Read Me also appears on your desktop, but for some reason it doesn’t show up until you open the Hard Disk icon.Let’s take a deeper look at how it all works by temporarily changing the partition type to Apple_HFS instead of Apple_Recovery and booting up again, so we can inspect the files. After a quick automatic rebuild of the desktop file, the Recovery Volume appears, with actual contents this time!Inside of the System Folder, there are definitely some interesting things. As expected based on the earlier analysis of the boot blocks, there is an app named “recovery” that contains all of the interesting stuff. The icons are kind of arranged willy-nilly in here.The creator code of the recovery app is msjy — the exact same magic value we saw in the partition table entry.Scrolling further down, there is a System file and various enablers. Everything is marked as being part of System Software v7.1P6.It’s interesting to me that although this recovery partition was only available on the 550, it still has a bunch of enablers for other Performa models: the 45x/46x, 47x/57x, and 600. I guess that’s not too crazy considering all of these exact same enablers are included with a fresh copy of System 7.1P6 installed using the Performa CD.As a quick detour, System Enabler 316 is an interesting one that is hard to find info about on the Internet. I inspected its ‘gbly’ resource and determined that it’s for the Centris 610, Centris 650, and Quadra 800. It’s an older version of the enabler created before the speed-bumped Quadra 610 and Quadra 650 were a thing. I wonder if there was a plan at some point to have a Performa model based on one of those machines? If I had to guess, maybe it would have been a 68040-based successor to the Performa 600, which uses the same case style as the Centris 650. The Performa 650?Let’s not get too far off track. Back to the Recovery Volume’s System Folder — as expected, the Startup Items folder contains the Read Me application:Everything started to become clear. The recovery app was marked as the startup application instead of the Finder. It displayed the dialog giving the user the option to recover. If they clicked OK, it would copy the entire System Folder from the Recovery Volume, omitting itself, to the Desktop Folder of the main hard drive partition. Then, it would “bless” the newly-copied mini System Folder and reboot.How did all this stuff get into the partition? Did Apple Backup do it, or was it factory-programmed data? I tried to see if I could deduce anything from the dates of the files. In order to preserve the integrity of all of the displayed dates, I performed this analysis with a read-only copy of the original drive image in order to prevent any modification dates from being updated.All of the files in the partition have a creation date of March 4, 1994 — over 31 years ago! Most of the files have a matching modification date, except for the System suitcase, which was last modified on September 26, 1994. I don’t know exactly what this all means, considering it came from a machine with a January 1994 manufacture date.The Recovery Volume itself also has a creation date of March 4th, just five minutes before the creation date of all the files. Interestingly, the modification date of the volume is still shown as March 4th in the Get Info window, even though the System suitcase was modified later in September of that year.The Master Directory Block of the Recovery Volume says the modification date (drLsMod) is September 26th, matching when the System file was changed. I’m not sure what causes this discrepancy. I guess the date displayed in the Get Info window isn’t simply the date stored in the Master Directory Block.Similarly, although the main hard drive partition has a creation date of December 5, 1993 according to the Master Directory Block, the Get Info window says it was created on February 3, 1994. I’m not sure which one is more accurate. Either way, it’s pretty clear this drive had not been reformatted. I did find it curious that the recovery partition was created over a month later, though. When you reformat a hard drive using the special version of Apple HD SC Setup on the Performa CD, the recovery partition ends up with a creation date about a minute after the main partition.The Finder and System Enablers in the recovery partition are identical to the same stock files from a 7.1P6 restore. The only difference I could find in the System file was that the recovery partition’s version was missing a single At Ease ‘INIT’ resource, but the At Ease Startup extension automatically adds it to the System file after you reboot. This leaves you with a System file totally identical to what is restored from the Performa CD. I find it odd that At Ease was stripped out, but the American Heritage Dictionary ‘FKEY’ resource was not.The best theory that I can come up with is that Apple Backup really was responsible for creating this partition. After all, Apple went out of their way to specifically mention it in their tech note. Maybe March 4th, 1994 was the date when the original owner of the computer backed it up for the first time. September 26th could have been the last time that Apple Backup was run. Perhaps the owner completely uninstalled At Ease from the computer between March and September, so the System file had been changed and the recovery copy needed to be updated accordingly? Unfortunately, most of the Performa-specific software had been deleted from this computer. It was still running System 7.1P6, but Apple Backup was nowhere to be found. So I wasn’t able to confirm whether or not a mysterious, unpreserved newer version of Apple Backup was really responsible for populating the partition.The other theory floating around in my head is that maybe it came from the factory like this. The March 1994 timeline is consistent with the date of the tech note describing the functionality, so maybe that’s when Apple created it and started bundling it. I don’t know how long the machines sat at Apple’s factory before they were actually sold — does a manufacture date of January 1994 also mean it was shipped to a store in January 1994? Either way, I definitely don’t know how to explain the September 26th, 1994 modification date. Maybe a third-party utility did something to the System file on the secondary partition? The first Apple Backup theory seems like the more likely explanation, especially given that Apple said that’s how it was created.This whole question is the last piece of the puzzle that hasn’t been solved yet. If anyone else has a Performa 550 and would be willing to dump their hard drive or at least look at Apple Backup, I’d be very interested in finding out A) if it has the recovery partition and B) if there was a special newer version of Apple Backup that didn’t make its way onto the Performa CD. I searched for various strings that show up in the “recovery” and “Read Me Mini System Folder” apps, and they aren’t anywhere on the Performa CD. I guess they could be stored compressed somewhere, but I’m pretty confident based on the actual Apple Backup code that nothing is hiding in there. Here are the various versions (with their exact sizes and dates) of Apple Backup that I have seen on Performa 550 installations. None of these have the recovery partition creation built in:I also found version 1.3 (June 15, 1994, 163,388 bytes used) by restoring from a Performa 636 restore CD. It, too, does not contain any recovery partition code.For a demo, I thought it would be fun to replicate the problem that the Apple tech note mentioned about the Dinosaur Safari CD inadvertently activating the recovery partition, so I bought a copy to test it out. To make it even more interesting, I decided to run this test on real hardware. I’m leaning toward believing that a lot of the older caddy-loading models (possibly all of them) didn’t have this recovery partition, so just pretend it’s a newer model that came with System 7.1P6. I copied the recovery partition onto a real Apple-branded IBM 160 MB SCSI hard drive using ZuluSCSI’s USB MSC initiator mode, which allows it to act as a USB-to-SCSI bridge. Sorry about the flickery screen; I couldn’t get my phone camera’s shutter speed to sync up perfectly with the display’s refresh rate.Sure enough, when I opened the game from the CD, the computer did exactly what Apple’s tech note said it would do. The workaround of copying the application to my hard drive worked just fine. If it’s not obvious, I sped up the process of copying it to the hard drive — it took a while! It might be interesting someday to look into why this game accidentally activated the OS recovery, but this blog is already getting way too long!I want to talk a little more about the yellow screen of shame. When I first saw it, I wasn’t entirely sure if it was really part of the recovery functionality or if the original owner just had terrible taste.Digging deeper, I found three clues that all made it clear it was an intentional choice by Apple to really make it obvious that something was wrong. First, the yellow pattern is stored as a ‘ppat’ resource in the recovery app.Second, the System file in the recovery partition has the default blue-gray Performa background shown in the screenshots above. This makes sense, because it’s the pattern that showed up with the dialog about the Performa having trouble starting up.And lastly, page 3 of the Read Me app implies that something may have changed your desktop pattern.So clearly, the recovery process, by design, sets up the custom yellow background.Why did I care so much about finding this lost partition? Well, there are a number of reasons. For one, this is exactly the kind of research project that’s perfect for me because I don’t know how to let things go. It’s also something that, quite frankly, needed to be preserved before it became extinct. The most important reason, though, is that this functionality is historically significant and deserves some attention. How many personal computers in 1994 still had the ability to boot after the OS was trashed? Isn’t this an extremely early example of this type of functionality? Did Windows have anything like this prior to Vista? Did the Mac have anything else like this prior to sometime in the OS X era? I would love to hear more comments about what you think on this. I admittedly don’t know a ton about older machines that weren’t Macs.I’m not saying this feature is perfect. Since we’ve already seen that the Dinosaur Safari CD was able to accidentally activate it, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were other ways to inadvertently cause it to pop up too. It also required manual intervention after the recovery process, which meant that you needed a fair amount of computer knowledge to finish fixing your OS. The average Joe Schmoe would probably have trouble following these directions to fix the System Folder. But still, it leaves you with a bootable system instead of an unusable computer with a flashing question mark. It’s very cool, especially for 1994.I wonder why Apple didn’t continue down this path with subsequent models? Or even retroactively adding the functionality to earlier ones after a fresh install of a newer OS. I’m not aware of any other Macs that have this partition. It doesn’t depend on any special ROM support or anything like that, at least as far as I can see. I tried out the recovery functionality on several other machines: a IIci, LC, LC 475, and an emulated Performa 600, and it works great on all of them. Heck, it even works on the Classic II/Performa 200!It kind of looks like the window size of the Read Me app was a calculated decision to ensure it would fit on the 512×342 screen used in black-and-white compact Macs.Thinking about later models, the Performa 630 series used an internal IDE hard drive instead of SCSI, so the custom version of Apple HD SC Setup was no longer used. I wonder if the Performa 57x series had this partition? You’d think they would have had the exact same software bundle as the tray-loading 550 models. If any readers have a Performa 57x machine, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could check!How did this functionality actually work under the hood? I haven’t gone too deep into the code (maybe it can be a future post), but I have pieced together a few clues. The “msjy” magic number I talked about earlier definitely plays a part in everything. The special Performa version of Apple HD SC Setup also includes a custom version of Apple’s hard disk driver. This driver contains several references to msjy, so I’m pretty sure that’s what it uses to identify the recovery partition.I also discovered that the 7.1P4 and 7.1P5 Utilities floppy disks, which were bundled with various Performas, have slightly older custom versions of Apple HD SC Setup: 7.2.1P and 7.2.2P respectively. They also create the recovery partition. The interesting thing about these versions is that it appears Apple accidentally forgot to strip out the debug function names, in both the utility itself and the bundled hard disk driver. They didn’t make this mistake in the original non-Performa 7.2.2 version, and they also didn’t make the mistake in the newer 7.2.2P6 version. Anyway, this is kind of cool, because it tells me the names of functions that look for “msjy” at an offset of 0x9C. Function names in that same area of the driver code include: , , , , and . So Apple definitely at least sort of released some of the recovery functionality to the public prior to 7.1P6, despite what their own version history says. And the disk driver is definitely involved in it.Newer versions of Apple’s disk driver no longer contain the magic number, so at some point they must have abandoned this functionality. In my opinion, it’s a real shame that they ditched it — this could have been very useful going forward on all Macs. They could have even expanded on it and automated more of the recovery process. Sure, it used some of your hard drive space, but it could have been a good trade-off for better reliability.That’s more than enough technical stuff for one post. I am sharing a download link where you can try this functionality out for yourself if you want. After all, the whole reason I did this was for software preservation purposes, so it makes sense to share it with the world. This is a small piece of Apple software history that, to my knowledge, has not been preserved until now. I uploaded a drive image to the Macintosh Garden. Don’t worry, I didn’t include any of the original owner’s personal data. I started fresh with a blank hard drive image, restored it using the 7.1P6 Performa CD, and then only copied over the restore partition from the dumped hard drive. So this is a factory-fresh Performa 550 7.1P6 install with the recovery partition also present and populated.The MAME command that I use to boot from this disk image is:Of course, you can also test it out on a real machine by copying the hard drive image to a ZuluSCSI or BlueSCSI and naming it something like HD00.hda.Winding down this super long post now, the main lessons I learned from this research project are:If you get your hands on a vintage computer, strongly consider backing the hard drive up before erasing it. I know it might contain someone’s personal files, so be mindful of that, and of course respect their privacy. But there might still be something hiding in the background that has been lost to time. You never know — it happened here!The fact that many hard drives go bad as they age might actually be a good thing for software preservation. If a vintage computer’s hard drive has a stuck head that can easily be bypassed, someone might sell it as non-working with data intact, rather than erasing it and selling it as “fully tested and wiped”.There are some really awesome people out there in the world!Special thanks to Pierre for discovering that this functionality even existed in the first place, and getting the word out so we could eventually preserve it. I also have to thank David Pogue and Joseph Schorr for writing about it in their book many decades ago. And of course, huge thanks to the amazing person from Reddit, who asked not to be credited, who gave me the opportunity to borrow and repair the drive that ended up containing the lost partition. You’re seriously the best!I’m going to repeat this again in case anybody has scrolled all the way to the end. There are still missing pieces of knowledge about how exactly this recovery partition would have been originally created. If you happen to have a Performa 550 with its original hard drive and wouldn’t mind checking for the partition and/or a special version of Apple Backup, please let me know! I would be happy to walk anybody through the process of dumping the drive contents. I’ll send you something if you don’t have the equipment needed to dump a hard drive. Even if the machine has been upgraded to System 7.5 or Mac OS 7.6, it’s still fine — everything could very well still be there, lurking in the background.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joby Aviation and Virgin Atlantic partner to launch electric air taxis in the UK</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/joby-aviation-and-virgin-atlantic-partner-to-launch-electric-air-taxis-in-the-uk/</link><author>Rebecca Bellan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joby Aviation is partnering with Virgin Atlantic to launch electric air taxis in the U.K., marking the seventh country in which the startup hopes to one day commercialize.

In the past these issues have been resolved quickly (within a week) and apologies issued with promises to do better. (See 2024-03-11, 2024-07-08, and 2025-01-30.) 

This time around it has been over six weeks and CloudFlare has been unable or unwilling to fix the problem on their end, effectively stalling any progress on the matter with various tactics including asking browser developers to sign overarching NDAs. 

That last link is an update posted today by Pale Moon's main developer:



Our current situation remains unchanged: CloudFlare is still blocking our access to websites through the challenges, and the captcha/turnstile continues to hang the browser until our watchdog terminates the hung script after which it reloads and hangs again after a short pause (but allowing users to close the tab in that pause, at least). To say that this upsets me is an understatement. Other than deliberate intent or absolute incompetence, I see no reason for this to endure. Neither of those options are very flattering for CloudFlare.

I wish I had better news.

It’s the successor to the venerable ESP8266 which has found its way into many of our WiFi connected devices (seriously, open up a device and chances are relatively large that you’ll find one).After having done quite a few projects based on the ESP32 in the Arduino and esp-idf frameworks I did start to notice some pecularities with my deployed devices (fancy wording for the one in my electrical cabinet that’s  to send the electrical usage data somewhere and a hodgepodge of sensor boards around the house, mostly the Snuffelaar by Sebastius with firmware written by Juerd).It seemed some of my ESP32 based boards were regularly losing connectivity. Initially my thoughts went out to the terrible power supplies I was using to run them (the cheapest of the cheap USB power supplies that came with a variety of accessories around my house). After switching these out for some more accessible and probably better quality tested Ikea chargers the problems, however, persisted.Asking around for experience from others at RevSpace, my local hackerspace, seemed to indicate that people had seen similar things with their ESP32-based projects. But not everyone had these issues. Slowly I started gathering more and more “superstitions” around how to keep these microcontrollers connected to my internet. Here are my favorite ones, I have applied all of these and while I haven’t tested them one-by-one the combination of them has ensured steady connections on my SSIDs.While these workarounds don’t quite come close to placing a hexagon of CR2023 batteries around your ESP32 while you chant the 802.11ax specification at it, they have no basis in any  research I did. Take these as anecdotal workarounds for ESP32’s losing connectivity to your WiFi.Turn off power saving on the ESP32The ESP8266 never had any power saving for its WiFi modem stack, however the ESP32 . To me this is the most likely culprit in that in some network configurations, perhaps in combination with some radios, the power saving does something that makes it stop interacting with the network.In your personal handcrafted firmware you can use the following, which should work in esp-idf  Arduino (from what I’ve been told):For ESPHome based projects you can add:Set your APs to use 20 Mhz wide channelsIf you have fancy network hardware then you can likely configure the channel width for the network that serves your ESP32’s. From what people and the internet tell me you  set the band width on the 2.4 Ghz network that your boards use to , not 40, not 60, and definitely not automatic.Pin your ESP32’s to a single APIt seems that when an ESP32 connects it goes straight for the first access point it sees. No matter if that access point is not the one you’ve taped it to. This can lead to bad connectivity, especially since I’ve not really observed ESP32’s moving around to other access points. If your network hardware allows it, you should pin the device to the closest one.These urban legends have so far made it seem that at least my problems are ghosts of the past. I haven’t had a device drop from the network in about a week or two now while they used to drop multiple times per day. I’m planning to drop my application level keep-alives (still a good idea, I’ll write about them another time) because they seem to not be necessary at all anymore.I hope these are of help to anyone, and that the spirits of the ESP32 deem your network worthy too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploying Local Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform &amp; KVM</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jc7np0/deploying_local_kubernetes_cluster_with_terraform/</link><author>/u/rached2023</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 23:06:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm trying to deploy a local Kubernetes cluster (1 master & 2 workers) using Terraform on KVM-based virtual machines.

 They are removing parking spaces and creating dedicated bike lanes. They are installing cameras at the perimeter of urban centers and either charging the most-polluting vehicles or preventing them from entering. Some are going so far as to put entire neighborhoods off-limits to vehicles. In Norway, Oslo promotes "car-free livability." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo touts the "end of car dependence." And while those ideas might sound radical to car-loving Americans, they are fast becoming the norm across the Atlantic, where 340 European cities and towns — home to more than 150 million people — have implemented some kind of restrictions on personal car usage... 

[V]irtually every major European city is imposing some kind of rule. Milan has a system similar to New York's, charging for access to the city core — while entirely banning older, highly polluting vehicles. London charges vehicles that don't meet emissions standards, in what it calls the "largest clean-air zone in the world." The programs are not just the purview of liberal Western Europe: Warsaw, Poland, and Sofia, Bulgaria, recently adopted similar schemes. Even little Italian villages have added vehicle restrictions to reinforce their historic feel. And the Netherlands just broke ground on a 12,000-person neighborhood that will be entirely car-free. The neighborhood, known as Merwede, will be connected by public transport to Utrecht, a medium-size city that — perhaps no surprise — has a low-emissions zone of its own... 

 Perhaps the most elaborate and transformative effort has come in Paris, where Anne Hidalgo was elected mayor in 2014. Since then, Paris has banned the most-polluting vehicles from the city, eliminated 50,000 parking spaces and added hundreds of miles of bike lanes. It turned a bank of the Seine from a busy artery into a pedestrian zone, and closed off the famed Rue de Rivoli to traffic... Journeys by car in Paris have dropped by about 45 percent since 1990. The city has now become a source for striking before-and-after photos: of clogged streets that have transitioned into tree-lined areas where people can walk and play. 
In London government officials say inhalable particular matter has fallen, according to the article, while combustion-produced nitrogen dioxide "is 53% lower than it would have been without the restrictions."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar: An alternative to Viktor Orban? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkYFfWxkIE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vtkYFfWxkIE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:44:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hungary's opposition hold large rallies on Hungary's Independence Day.

In April, Ukraine sortied one of its then-new Aeroprakt A-22 sport plane drones to strike a drone plant in Yelabuga, 550 miles east of Moscow.The 2024 raid remains one of the deepest in Ukraine’s escalating campaign of deep strikes on Russian targets, And it may have been the first in which the Ukrainian drones went after the industry supporting Russia’s own drones.It makes sense for the Ukrainians to continue striking Russian drone factories. Ukraine’s edge in drone warfare is perhaps its most important advantage as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 37th month.Ukrainian drones are so thick in the sky in many of the most important sectors that any Russian vehicles that leave their dugouts “operate in a one-way manner,” one Russian blogger complained.Struggling to jam the well-made Ukrainian drones, the Russians are trying to at least match the explosive UAVs vehicle-for-vehicle—if not exceed them on a technological level.Elite Russian drone groups were the first in Ukraine to deploy unjammable fiber-optic drones that send and receive signals via miles-long cables instead of via radio datalinks, which are vulnerable to Ukrainian electronic warfare.And now the Kremlin is ramping up production of the most numerous first-person-view drones in order to keep pace with Ukrainian production. The Kremlin has announced it will acquire as many as 4 million FPV drones this year; the defense ministry in Kyiv is hoping to acquire 4.5 million. The gap is closing.In blowing up the drone factories, ironically with drones, the Ukrainian intelligence agency hopes to throttle Russian production—and ensure that most of the tiny UAVs buzzing over the front line ... are Ukrainian.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>best way to integrate argocd and hashicorp vault</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jc4ise/best_way_to_integrate_argocd_and_hashicorp_vault/</link><author>/u/Existing-Mirror2315</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 20:35:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/Existing-Mirror2315 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk Says SpaceX&apos;s First Mission to Mars Will Launch Next Year</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/03/15/1947252/elon-musk-says-spacexs-first-mission-to-mars-will-launch-next-year?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 20:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said his Starship rocket will head to Mars by the end of next year," writes the BBC, "as the company investigates several recent explosions in flight tests."

While he’s still able to think clearly in many ways, his ability to use technology has taken a hit. He only got into computers and smartphones later in life, and now, with so much of society relying on digital tools—whether it’s banking, doctor appointments, or even just staying in touch—he’s struggling.Where I live, we even have a government-issued two-factor authentication device/app that’s required for almost everything. It’s frustrating for him, and I’ve seen firsthand how technology, which should be making life easier, is actually making him feel more isolated. And let’s be real—this reliance on tech is only going to increase.The Idea I’d love to create an ultra-simple Linux desktop tailored for people like my dad. Something that: • Boots straight into a locked-down, minimal desktop. • Has only a few essential programs, like a web browser, email client, or video calling app. • Allows relatives to configure everything through an admin panel setting bookmarks, fixing icons, and keeping things simple. • Runs on familiar hardware, since Linux makes it easy to install on existing devices with a USB.This would be a passion project. I just see a real need for it, and I’m sure it could help a lot of people.My Question I’m not planning on touching kernel code or diving into low-level OS development. I have some programming experience (mostly in data engineering and data science), but I don’t even know where to start researching a project like this. What tools or frameworks should I look into? Are there existing Linux distros or desktop environments that could be adapted for this purpose?I know this won’t be ready in time to help my dad, but I’d still love to explore the idea.

Because here's the thing. The $10 billion James Webb Space telescope (in operation since 2022) "has found that the vast majority of deep space and, thus the early galaxies it has so far observed, are rotating in the same direction. While around two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise, the other third rotates counter-clockwise."

In a random universe, scientists would expect to find 50% of galaxies rotating one way, while the other 50% rotate the other way. This new research suggests there is a preferred direction for galactic rotation... "It is still not clear what causes this to happen, but there are two primary possible explanations," team leader Lior Shamir, associate professor of computer science at the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering, said in a statement. "One explanation is that the universe was born rotating. 

"That explanation agrees with theories such as black hole cosmology, which postulates that the entire universe is the interior of a black hole. 

"But if the universe was indeed born rotating, it means that the existing theories about the cosmos are incomplete." Black hole cosmology, also known as "Schwarzschild cosmology," suggests that our observable universe might be the interior of a black hole itself within a larger parent universe. The idea was first introduced by theoretical physicist Raj Kumar Pathria and by mathematician I. J. Good. It presents the idea that the "Schwarzchild radius," better known as the "event horizon," (the boundary from within which nothing can escape a black hole, not even light) is also the horizon of the visible universe. 
The article cites a theory by Polish theoretical physicist Nikodem Poplawski of the University of New Haven that ultimately black holes don't compress indefinitely into a singularity. "The matter instead reaches a state of finite, extremely large density, stops collapsing, undergoes a bounce like a compressed spring, and starts rapidly expanding," Poplawski explained to Space.com...
The scientist continued by adding that rapid recoil after such a big bounce could be what has led to our expanding universe, an event we now refer to as the Big Bang... "I think that the simplest explanation of the rotating universe is the universe was born in a rotating black hole." 
Team leader Shamir offers another theory: that we just need to re-calibrate our distance measurements for the deep universe. (Which could also explain the difference in the expansion rates in the universe "and the large galaxies that according to the existing distance measurements are expected to be older than the universe itself.")]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s tariffs leave US bourbon distillers in limbo | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flwmep6zVgU</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/flwmep6zVgU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Victor Yarbrough, who is a small bourbon producer in Kentucky had been in talks to expand sales in Canada but with the Trump administration’s tariff war, ‘the whole Canadian growth strategy is now on pause,’ he said.

Attackers who are in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization can use it to construct SAML assertions themselves and are in turn able to log in as any user. In other words, it could be used for an account takeover attack. Users of ruby-saml should update to version 1.18.0. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml.In this blog post, we detail newly discovered authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the ruby-saml library used for single sign-on (SSO) via SAML on the service provider (application) side. GitHub doesn’t currently use ruby-saml for authentication, but began evaluating the use of the library with the intention of using an open source library for SAML authentication once more. This library is, however, used in other popular projects and products. We discovered an exploitable instance of this vulnerability in GitLab, and have notified their security team so they can take necessary actions to protect their users against potential attacks.GitHub previously used the ruby-saml library up to 2014, but moved to our own SAML implementation due to missing features in ruby-saml at that time. Following bug bounty reports around vulnerabilities in our own implementation (such as CVE-2024-9487, related to encrypted assertions), GitHub recently decided to explore the use of ruby-saml again. Then in October 2024, a blockbuster vulnerability dropped: an authentication bypass in ruby-saml (CVE-2024-45409) by ahacker1. With tangible evidence of exploitable attack surface, GitHub’s switch to ruby-saml had to be evaluated more thoroughly now. As such, GitHub started a private bug bounty engagement to evaluate the security of the ruby-saml library. We gave selected bug bounty researchers access to GitHub test environments using ruby-saml for SAML authentication. In tandem, the GitHub Security Lab also reviewed the attack surface of the ruby-saml library.As is not uncommon when multiple researchers are looking at the same code, both ahacker1, a participant in the GitHub bug bounty program, and I noticed the same thing during code review: ruby-saml was using two different XML parsers during the code path of signature verification. Namely, REXML and Nokogiri. While REXML is an XML parser implemented in pure Ruby, Nokogiri provides an easy-to-use wrapper API around different libraries like libxml2, libgumbo and Xerces (used for JRuby). Nokogiri supports parsing of XML and HTML. It looks like Nokogiri was added to ruby-saml to support canonicalization and potentially other things REXML didn’t support at that time.We both inspected the same code path in the  of  and found that the signature element to be verified is first read via REXML, and then also with Nokogiri’s XML parser. So, if REXML and Nokogiri could be tricked into retrieving different signature elements for the same XPath query it might be possible to trick ruby-saml into verifying the wrong signature. It looked like there could be a potential authentication bypass due to a !The reality was actually more complicated than this.Roughly speaking, four stages were involved in the discovery of this authentication bypass:Discovering that two different XML parsers are used during code review.  Establishing if and how a parser differential could be exploited.  Finding an actual parser differential for the parsers in use.  Leveraging the parser differential to create a full-blown exploit.To prove the security impact of this vulnerability, it was necessary to complete all four stages and create a full-blown authentication bypass exploit.Quick recap: how SAML responses are validatedSecurity assertion markup language (SAML) responses are used to transport information about a signed-in user from the identity provider (IdP) to the service provider (SP) in XML format. Often the only important information transported is a username or an email address. When the HTTP POST binding is used, the SAML response travels from the IdP to the SP via the browser of the end user. This makes it obvious why there has to be some sort of signature verification in play to prevent the user from tampering with the message.Let’s have a quick look at what a simplified SAML response looks like:Note: in the response above the XML namespaces were removed for better readability.As you might have noticed: the main part of a simple SAML response is its assertion element (A), whereas the main information contained in the assertion is the information contained in the  element (B) (here the NameID containing the username: admin). A real assertion typically contains more information (e.g.  and  dates as part of a  element.)Normally, the  (A) (without the whole  part) is canonicalized and then compared against the  (C) and the  (D) is canonicalized and verified against the  (E). In this sample, the assertion of the SAML response is signed, and in other cases the whole SAML response is signed.Searching for parser differentialsWe learned that ruby-saml used two different XML parsers (REXML and Nokogiri) for validating the SAML response. Now let’s have a look at the verification of the signature and the digest comparison.
The focus of the following explanation lies on the  method inside of .Inside that method, there’s a broad XPath query with REXML for the first signature element inside the SAML document:sig_element = REXML::XPath.first(
  @working_copy,
  "//ds:Signature",
  {"ds"=>DSIG}
)
Hint: When reading the code snippets, you can tell the difference between queries for REXML and Nokogiri by looking at how they are called. REXML methods are prefixed with , whereas Nokogiri methods are called on .Later, the actual  is read from this element:base64_signature = REXML::XPath.first(
  sig_element,
  "./ds:SignatureValue",
  {"ds" => DSIG}
)
signature = Base64.decode64(OneLogin::RubySaml::Utils.element_text(base64_signature))
Note: the name of the  element might be a bit confusing. While it contains the actual signature in the  node it also contains the part that is actually signed in the  node. Most importantly the  element contains the digest (hash) of the assertion and information about the used key.So, an actual  element could look like this (removed namespace information for better readability):<Signature>
    <SignedInfo>
        <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" />

    </KeyInfo>
</Signature>
Later in the same method () there’s again a query for the Signature(s)—but this time with Nokogiri.noko_sig_element = document.at_xpath('//ds:Signature', 'ds' => DSIG)
Then the  element is taken from that signature and canonicalized:noko_signed_info_element = noko_sig_element.at_xpath('./ds:SignedInfo', 'ds' => DSIG)

canon_string = noko_signed_info_element.canonicalize(canon_algorithm)
Let’s remember this  contains the canonicalized  element.The  element is then also extracted with REXML: signed_info_element = REXML::XPath.first(
        sig_element,
        "./ds:SignedInfo",
        { "ds" => DSIG }
 )
From this  element the  node is read:ref = REXML::XPath.first(signed_info_element, "./ds:Reference", {"ds"=>DSIG})
reference_nodes = document.xpath("//*[@ID=$id]", nil, { 'id' => extract_signed_element_id })
The method extract_signed_element_idextracts the signed element id with help of REXML. From the previous authentication bypass (CVE-2024-45409), there’s now a check that only one element with the same ID can exist.The first of the  is taken and canonicalized:hashed_element = reference_nodes[0][..]canon_hashed_element = hashed_element.canonicalize(canon_algorithm, inclusive_namespaces)
The  is then hashed:hash = digest_algorithm.digest(canon_hashed_element)
The  to compare it against is then extracted with REXML:encoded_digest_value = REXML::XPath.first(
        ref,
        "./ds:DigestValue",
        { "ds" => DSIG }
      )
digest_value = Base64.decode64(OneLogin::RubySaml::Utils.element_text(encoded_digest_value))
Finally, the  (built from the element extracted by Nokogiri) is compared against the  (extracted with REXML):unless digests_match?(hash, digest_value)
The  extracted some lines ago (a result of an extraction with Nokogiri) is later verified against (extracted with REXML).unless cert.public_key.verify(signature_algorithm.new, signature, canon_string)
In the end, we have the following constellation:The assertion is extracted and canonicalized with Nokogiri, and then hashed. In contrast, the hash against which it will be compared is extracted with REXML.  The SignedInfo element is extracted and canonicalized with Nokogiri - it is then verified against the SignatureValue, which was extracted with REXML.Exploiting the parser differentialThe question is: is it possible to create an XML document where REXML sees one signature and Nokogiri sees another?Ahacker1, participating in the bug bounty, was faster to produce a working exploit using a parser differential. Among other things, ahacker1 was inspired by the XML roundtrips vulnerabilities published by Mattermost’s Juho Forsén in 2021.Not much later, I produced an exploit using a different parser differential with the help of Trail of Bits’ Ruby fuzzer called ruzzy.Both exploits result in an authentication bypass. Meaning that an attacker, who is in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization, can use it to construct assertions for any users which will be accepted by ruby-saml. Such a signature can either come from a signed assertion or response from another (unprivileged) user or in certain cases, it can even come from signed metadata of a SAML identity provider (which can be publicly accessible).An exploit could look like this. Here, an additional Signature was added as part of the  element that is only visible to Nokogiri:The  element (A) from the signature that is visible to Nokogiri is canonicalized and verified against the  (B) that was extracted from the signature seen by REXML.The assertion is retrieved via Nokogiri by looking for its ID. This assertion is then canonicalized and hashed (C). The hash is then compared to the hash contained in the  (D). This DigestValue was retrieved via REXML. This DigestValue has no corresponding signature.So, two things take place:A valid SignedInfo with DigestValue is verified against a valid signature. (which checks out)  A fabricated canonicalized assertion is compared against its calculated digest. (which checks out as well)This allows an attacker, who is in possession of a valid signed assertion for any (unprivileged) user, to fabricate assertions and as such impersonate any other user.Check for errors when using NokogiriParts of the currently known, undisclosed exploits can be stopped by checking for Nokogiri parsing errors on SAML responses. Sadly, those errors do not result in exceptions, but need to be checked on the  member of the parsed document:doc = Nokogiri::XML(xml) do |config|
  config.options = Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::STRICT | Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::NONET
end

raise "XML errors when parsing: " + doc.errors.to_s if doc.errors.any?
While this is far from a perfect fix for the issues at hand, it renders at least one exploit infeasible.We are not aware of any reliable indicators of compromise. While we’ve found a potential indicator of compromise, it only works in debug-like environments and to publish it, we would have to reveal too many details about how to implement a working exploit so we’ve decided that it’s better not to publish it. Instead, our best recommendation is to look for suspicious logins via SAML on the service provider side from IP addresses that do not align with the user’s expected location.SAML and XML signatures:as confusing as it getsSome might say it’s hard to integrate systems with SAML. That might be true. However, it’s even harder to write implementations of SAML using XML signatures in a secure way. As others have stated before: it’s probably best to disregard the specifications, as following them doesn’t help build secure implementations.
To rehash how the validation works if the SAML assertion is signed, let’s have a look at the graphic below,  depicting a simplified SAML response. The assertion, which transports the protected information, contains a signature. Confusing, right?To complicate it even more: What is even signed here? The whole assertion? No!What’s signed is the  element and the  element contains a . This  is the hash of the canonicalized assertion with the signature element removed before the canonicalization. This two-stage verification process can lead to implementations that have a disconnect between the verification of the hash and the verification of the signature. This is the case for these Ruby-SAML parser differentials: while the hash and the signature check out on their own, they have no connection. The hash is actually a hash of the assertion, but the signature is a signature of a different  element containing another hash. What you actually want is a direct connection between the hashed content, the hash, and the signature. (And once the verification is done you only want to retrieve information from the exact part that was actually verified.) Or, alternatively, use a less complicated standard to transport a cryptographically signed username between two systems - but here we are.In this case, the library already extracted the  and used it to verify the signature of its canonicalized string,. However, it did not use it to obtain the digest value. If the library had used the content of the already extracted  to obtain the digest value, it would have been secure in this case even with two XML parsers in use.As shown once again: relying on two different parsers in a security context can be tricky and error-prone. That being said: exploitability is not automatically guaranteed in such cases. As we have seen in this case, checking for Nokogiri errors could not have prevented the parser differential, but could have stopped at least one practical exploitation of it.The initial fix for the authentication bypasses does not remove one of the XML parsers to prevent API compatibility problems. As noted, the more fundamental issue was the disconnect between verification of the hash and verification of the signature, which was exploitable via parser differentials. The removal of one of the XML parsers was already planned for other reasons, and will likely come as part of a major release in combination with additional improvements to strengthen the library. If your company relies on open source software for business-critical functionality, consider sponsoring them to help fund their future development and bug fix releases.If you’re a user of ruby-saml library, make sure to update to the latest version, 1.18.0, containing fixes for CVE-2025-25291 and CVE-2025-25292. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml. We will publish a proof of concept exploit at a later date in the GitHub Security Lab repository.Special thanks to Sixto Martín, maintainer of ruby-saml, and Jeff Guerra from the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
Special thanks also to ahacker1 for giving inputs to this blog post.2024-11-04: Bug bounty report demonstrating an authentication bypass was reported against a GitHub test environment evaluating ruby-saml for SAML authentication.  2024-11-04: Work started to identify and test potential mitigations.  2024-11-12: A second authentication bypass was found by Peter that renders the planned mitigations for the first useless.  2024-11-13: Initial contact with Sixto Martín, maintainer of ruby-saml.  2024-11-14: Both parser differentials are reported to ruby-saml, the maintainer responds immediately.  2024-11-14: The work on potential patches by the maintainer and ahacker1 begins. (One of the initial ideas was to remove one of the XML parsers, but this was not feasible without breaking backwards compatibility).  2025-02-04: ahacker1 proposes a non-backwards compatible fix.  2025-02-06: ahacker1 also proposes a backwards compatible fix.  2025-02-12: The 90 days deadline of GitHub Security Lab advisories ends.  2025-02-16: The maintainer starts working on a fix with the idea to be backwards-compatible and easier to understand.  2025-02-17: Initial contact with GitLab to coordinate a release of their on-prem product with the release of the ruby-saml library.  2025-03-12: A fixed version of ruby-saml was released.Security Researcher at GitHub Security Lab]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to watch Nvidia GTC 2025, including CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/how-to-watch-nvidia-gtc-2025-including-ceo-jensen-huangs-keynote/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:59:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GTC, Nvidia’s biggest conference of the year, will return this week, with the biggest announcements probably coming Tuesday.

(credit: REUTERS/STRINGER)US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that “today, I have ordered the United States military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones.”Trump also slammed his predecessor, former president Joe Biden, for his “pathetically weak” handling of the Houthi threat.“Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our troops and allies. These relentless assaults have cost the US and world economy many billions of dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” the president stressed.Stay updated with the latest news!Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter“The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated,” Trump wrote. “We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.

But while the cars obey speed limits and properly use their turn signals — they also "routinely violate parking rules."

Waymo vehicles driving themselves received 589 tickets for parking violations in 2024, according to records from San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency... The robots incurred $65,065 in fines for violations such as obstructing traffic, disobeying street cleaning restrictions and parking in prohibited areas... [Waymo is responsible for 0.05% of the city's fines, according to statistics from the article.] 

Parking violations are one of the few ways to quantify how often self-driving companies' vehicles break the rules of the road... Some parking violations, such as overstaying in a paid spot, cause inconvenience but do not directly endanger other people. Others increase the risk of crashes, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. Anytime a vehicle is obstructing the flow of traffic, other drivers might be forced to brake suddenly or change lanes, he said, creating risks for drivers, pedestrians or other road users... 

San Francisco transit operators lost 2 hours and 12 minutes of service time in 2024 because of Waymo vehicles blocking or colliding with transit vehicles, according to San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency records. Autonomous vehicles have obstructed firefighters responding to emergency scenes in San Francisco, triggering city officials to ask for tougher oversight from state regulators. 

The article adds that driverless Waymo vehicles in Los Angeles received 75 more tickets in 2024 — "with $543 in fines still outstanding, according to records from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Orban accuses the EU of abusing its power in fiery speech commemorating Hungary’s Independence Day</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw0qj8gXSWk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mw0qj8gXSWk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:18:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, Viktor Orban held a speech at an Independence Day rally commemorating Hungary's revolution against the Austrian Empire on March 15th, 1848.

In 2012 Mann sued two bloggers for defamation — and last year Mann finally won more than $1 million, reports the Washington Post. "A jury found that two conservative commentators had defamed him by alleging that he was like a child molester in the way he had 'molested and tortured' climate data." 

But "Now, a year after that ruling, the case has taken a turn that leaves Mann in the position of the one who owes money."

 On Wednesday, a judge sanctioned Mann's legal team for "bad-faith trial misconduct" for overstating how much the scientist lost in potential grant funding as a result of reputational harm. The lawyers had shown jurors a chart that listed one grant amount Mann didn't get at $9.7 million, though in other testimony Mann said it was worth $112,000. And when comparing Mann's grant income before and after the negative commentary, the lawyers cited a disparity of $2.8 million, but an amended calculation pegged it at $2.37 million. 

The climate scientist's legal team said it was preparing to fight the setbacks in court. Peter J. Fontaine, one of Mann's attorneys, wrote in an email that Mann "believes that the court committed errors of fact and law and will pursue these matters further." Fontaine emphasized that the original decision — that Mann was defamed by the commentary — still stands. "We have reviewed the recent rulings by the D.C. Superior Court and are pleased to note that the court has upheld the jury's verdict," he said.

Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada’s plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets.The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each.A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada given the “changing environment,” or if there are better options.“At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft,” Laurent de Casanove said in a statement to CityNews. “The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs.”“To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract.” Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada. The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032. In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, “particularly where there may be opportunities” to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada.“The direction I’ve been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada,” he said.Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners “to see what is possible.”A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments. “Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future,” the company said in a statement.The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.On-again, off-again decision to buy F-35sThe Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition in 2010, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider.Then, in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35 at all.The government planned to buy 18 Super Hornets without a competition as an “interim” measure but cancelled the plan after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier.Ottawa initiated an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019.In January 2023, Canada announced it would buy the F-35 fighter jet with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.At the time, Defence Minister Anita Anand called the F-35 the best choice for Canada.A mixed fleet of planes ‘less disruptive, but costly and complex’Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued that Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them.He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should “cut its losses.”“We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems,” he said.Philippe Lagassé, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a “large scale transition underway” from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn’t only include the planes, but also the also the “infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America.”Lagassé, who also served as a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking.“It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time,” he said.Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane “would be less disruptive, but costly and complex.”The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion. A 2023 report estimated the acquisition phase would cost $19.8 billion, including $10.7 billion for 88 planes, $2.1 billion for weapons and ammunition and $5.9 billion for elements like design and depot costs, infrastructure and training.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cubans left in the dark after electrical grid fails | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_90BNmejGo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W_90BNmejGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 17:20:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cuba's national electrical grid collapsed late on Friday, leading to blackouts across the country.

Of course, the most important thing about that year is The Beatles landing in the United States and kicking off the British Invasion. But the year is endlessly discussed because so much else went on. The Rolling Stones released their debut albumMotown became a dominant force in pop music, releasing four number ones, three of which were by The SupremesBob Dylan dropped two albumsThe Beach Boys continued their run of hits“Everybody Loves Somebody” by Dean Martin“Where Did Our Love Go” by The Supremes“A Hard Day’s Night” by The Beatles“Rag Doll” by Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons“Under the Boardwalk” by The DriftersThese are five songs that I return to often. And weeks like this weren’t even that rare in 1964. Just one week later, you had the same songs in the top five, except “Rag Doll” was replaced by The Animals’ “House of the Rising Son,” the song that some claim made Dylan go electric and pushed rock music into a completely new direction.The one claim that’s always fascinated me about 1964 is that it was a line of demarcation between an old and a new way to make music. If you were making hits in 1963 and didn’t change your sound in 1964, you were going to be waiting tables by the beginning of 1965. In other words, The Beatles-led British Invasion decimated the careers of scores of artists. But was this really the case?To do this, I grabbed a list of all 175 acts who released at least one top 40 single in 1963. (Fun fact: the record for the most top 40 hits that year was shared by five acts: Bobby Vinton, Brenda Lee, Dion & the Belmonts, Ray Charles, and The Beach Boys. Each had six top 40 hits.) I then decided to see which of those acts never released a hit in 1964 or any year after. In total, 88 of those 175 acts, or 50%, never had a top 40 hit again. That’s kind of a lot. In other words, The Beatles and their fellow invading Brits killed a lot of careers. Or did they? By looking at only a single year we could be biased. And we are.If we calculate that same rate for every single year between 1960 and 2020, we see that while the kill rate in 1964 was high, it wasn’t completely out of the ordinary. The median is around 40%. Having a multi-year career as a popular artist is just hard. By looking at the years with the highest rates, we can glean a few other things, though.First, three of the top ten rates are 1962, 1963, and 1964. In other words, there is some credence to the theory that the British Invasion decimated many careers. Nevertheless, the fact that the rates in 1962 and 1963 are high tells me that sonic changes were brewing in the United States too. Had The Beatles not arrived, rock music probably still would have evolved in a way that would have left earlier hitmakers in the dust. That sonic evolution would have been different, though.changed their chart methodologyearlier newsletterIn other words, the 1990s were strange. And I think we are just beginning to grapple with that strangeness. Because of that, there was a ton of turnover on the charts. It’s hard for artists to keep up with trends when grunge, gangsta rap, swing, and a new breed of teen pop are all successful in a matter of years. Being a superstar isn’t easy.Aggregating this data got me thinking about which artists have been able to survive the most musical changes and still find success. While there are artists, like Elton John and The Rolling Stones, who put out hits for decades, I want to point out one artist whose resilience still shocks me: Frankie Valli. Born in 1934, Valli had his first major hit in 1962 with “Sherry,” a song performed with his group The Four Seasons. Before The Beatles splashed on American shores, Valli and his bandmates had eight more top 40 hits. But they were the kind of group that you’d expect to be decimated by the new sound of rock music. The Four Seasons were sort of a throwback even in 1963, Valli and his falsetto pointing toward the doo-wop of the last decade.But Valli and his collaborators forged on. They made some musical missteps but they remained a musical force through 1967, releasing bonafide classics, like “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.” Okay. So, he survived the British Invasion. Some others did too. But Valli didn’t go quietly as the 1960s came to a close. In 1974, he scored a massive hit with “My Eyes Adored You,” a song that played well with the soft rock that was dominant at the time. Then disco began to boom and Valli remained undeterred. “Swearin' to God.” “Who Loves You.” “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night).” The man could not be stopped.A New OneAlligator Bites Never Heal An Old OneAs I was admiring 1964, I noticed that the week of October 10 had a mind-blowing top five. It included Roy Orbison’s “Oh, Pretty Woman,” Manfred Mann’s “Do Wah Diddy Diddy,” Martha & the Vandellas’ “Dancing in the Street,” and The Shangri-Las’ “Remember (Walkin’ in the Sand).” There was one song that I wasn’t familiar with, though: “Bread and Butter” by The Newbeats.“Bread and Butter” is fun, little novelty about bread, butter, toast, jam, and losing your lover. The most notable thing about the song is a half-screamed falsetto that appears periodically throughout the song as performed by Larry Henley. Incidentally, Henley is another good example of musical resilience. After his performing career ended, he wrote a few hits over the decades, including Bette Midler’s massive 1989 ballad “Wind Beneath My Wings.”Shout out to the paid subscribers who allow this newsletter to exist.

We've landed two big changes in rust-analyzer this past week: - A Salsa upgrade. Today, this should  improve performance, but in the near future, the new Salsa will allow us do features like parallel autocomplete and persistent caches. This work also unblocks us from using the Rust compiler's new trait solver! - Salsa-ification of the crate graph, which changed the unit of incrementality to an individual crate from the entire crate graph. This finer-grained incrementality means that actions that'd previously invalidate the entire crate graph (such as adding/removing a dependency or editing a build script/proc macro) will now cause rust-analyzer to  reindex the changed crate(s),  the entire workspace.While we're pretty darn confident in these changes, these are big changes, so we'd appriciate some testing from y'all!If you're using Visual Studio Code: 1. Open the "Extensions" view () on a Mac;  on other platforms. 2. Find and open the "rust-analyzer extension". 3. Assuming it is installed, and click the button that says "Switch to Pre-Release Version". VS Code should install a nightly rust-analyzer and prompt you to reload extensions. 4. Let us know if anything's off!Other Editors/Building From Source(Note that rust-analyzer compiles on the latest stable Rust! You do not need a nightly.)git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer.git. Make sure you're on the latest commit!cargo xtask install --server --jemalloc. This will build and place rust-analyzer into into ~/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer.Update your your editor to point to that new path. in VS Code, the setting is rust-analyzer.server.path, other editors have some way to override the path.

We should probably
                promote them to full-blown tuple types.
              All of this is normal. Sickos like me  discussing perceived shortcomings of programming
              languages. It’s nothing personal. I like Go, even, despite its shortcomings.
            
              My personal candidate for Go’s  historical mistake is that of multiple return values,
              exactly because of how harmless they look.
              Multiple return values influenced the design of the language (in bad ways), interact poorly with other
              features, and make the language much more complex than it has to be.
            Exhibit A, multiple return values:Looking at this, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Go has ’tuples’ (like Python or Rust).
              It doesn’t. There’s no such thing as a ’tuple’. All Go has is a special case syntax which allows functions
              to return multiple values at the same time. If you want something that sort of behaves like a tuple in Go,
              you need to define a struct.
              There’s a few other cases of this ‘multiple return values’ behavior special cased for the built-in
               operator or when accessing a value from a map or channel.
            
              What I’m complaining about in this screed is that—as a consequence of putting multiple return values into
              the language and not making them a dedicated tuple type—Go is in a worse state than it had to be, and that
              all of this was completely avoidable.
            
              When I use other languages, I tend to be  that whatever one of my functions spits
              out, I can put it into a list or vector.
            
              Through the power of Go, it’s impossible to  pass data around without additional ceremony. I
              can’t overstate how  it is that in the world of Go, calling a function and being able to
              store the result in a list is the exception, and not the rule.
            
              This (of course) doesn’t compile since  is not a type. Tuples don’t exist. So
              you  get used to first refactoring all of your functions and defining a whole new struct
              just to pass some data around. Maybe use two lists? Or a new struct? Amazing.
            This gets significantly more annoying once you try to go concurrent.
              Imagine that you want to spin up some goroutines, have each call
              func doStuff() (string, error), and then gather the results. You  pass
               through a channel since it’s not a standalone type. The usual workaround is
              to do
              whatever this is
              or to
              define a custom struct:
            
              Let me repeat this: Go—a language famous for its concurrency and uncompromising errors-as-values
              approach—requires you to define a non-standard wrapper type to handle errors as soon as its most basic
              synchronization primitive is involved or to store  in a slice.
            In other words, Go’s error handling and concurrency don’t compose.Hell, even Go’s built-in containers and error handling don’t compose!
              Like many of Go’s problems, it’s something you can work around, but I don’t think that that’s much of an
              excuse.
            
              The whole idea behind Go’s error handling is that . You can pass them around
              like values, inspect them like values, and they’re handled using the same control flow constructs as
              everything else.
            
              So despite errors being values, the return of a function call is  not a value at all.
              You can’t pass it around, you can’t store it.
            
              A friend of mine has suggested that he believes that “Rob Pike invented Go as a practical joke.”. That’s a
              pretty rough way too put it, but I can’t entirely blame him? Why would you design a language where the
              result of a function call cannot be stored or passed around?
            
              The problem is that this situation was avoidable—if anyone had thought about this in slightly more detail
              back in the earliest design days—it would’ve been easy to just promote multiple return values to anonymous
              structs. Instead that time was, presumably, spent adding nonsense like
              named return values.
            
              This is about . Nothing is ‘simple’ about the fact that calling a function doesn’t
              return a value. It’s a weird idiosyncrasy. By trying to make the language ‘simple’, you played yourself
              and added a weird edge case.
            Iterators and ‘Range over Functions’Here’s a basic example of ranging over functions:
              Just create a constructor function which returns a function which captures variables from the enclosing
              function scope, and uses them to decide when to call its argument function, thereby determining the
              behavior of the loop for the end-user. Nothing could possibly be easier. (That’s sarcasm. I find this code
              hard to read and would’ve preferred an interface-based approach.)
            The Go standard library defines the following types and functions as part of this release:
              Go cannot handle the case of iterating over one or two values in a uniform, parametrized way. It requires
              , one for handling one value at a time, and one for two values.
            
              Because Go doesn’t have ’tuples’. Why doesn’t Go have tuples? I don’t know—There were
              some vague discussions in 2009, but it just looks like the Go developers didn’t think of the feature as particularly important. Keeping
              the language ‘small’ was the higher priority for them.
            
              Again: This was an attempt to keep the language ‘simple’ which
              now results in weird, complex edge cases and having to learn twice as many APIs. Congratulations,
              you tried to simplify and instead just played yourself.
            
              (Back in the day Go didn’t have generics. Designing a language that interacts poorly with generics under
              the assumption they’ll never be added was a design tradeoff that probably made sense at the time. Funfact:
              Go took 5 years until it’s 1.0 release. Rust needed 9 years, and Zig still isn’t there.)
            
              Take a step back to think about what this means: The designers of the standard library are forced to
              hardcode specific instances of a type because the language is unable to sufficiently abstract over whether
              you’re handling one or two values at a time.
            
              Again: This is not a hard technical problem. There  solutions for this. It’s not even hard if
              you design a language from the get-go. Go just didn’t implement them.
            
              Consider what this means for Go’s library ecosystem. If even the standard library easily runs into
              situations where it’s necessary to work around this limitation, how hard do you think it is a
              library that does anything slightly fancier? (Again, this limitation extends to error handling, since
              error handling happens through multiple return values.)
            Warning: Hot opinions ahead, and a bunch of speculation.
              Go’s multiple return value-based error handling was considered to be “good enough”, and prevented the
              development of a better approach to error handling.
            
              In reality that could’ve gone either way: The Go developers considered enums and or-operators to be such
              mysterious, advanced features that there’s no guarantees Go would have ended up with
              -type based error handling even if multiple return values had never made it into the
              language.
            For all we know we’d have “Go with exceptions”, which would probably be a step backwards.
              Still: I’ll stand by the fact that multiple return values were a classic ‘worse is better’-type solution
              that prevented the Go developers from ever  anything even slightly more nuanced,
              like a
              Result type (aka a sum
              type purely for error handling, i.e. a value which is either a result  an error).
            
              Instead, we’re stuck with multiple return values-based error handling. I’m sure you’ve seen people
              complain about the issues with accidental shadowing of variables. Those make it pretty easy to
              accidentally forget to check errors. Not a big deal but (once again, this is a running theme here)
              entirely unnecessary.
            
              Or taking an example from
              here, that code like this compiles:
            Or the fact that, no, there’s nothing that stops you from writing functions like this here:Is this bad? Well, it’s by design.
              I am not saying Go’s error handling is . It’s okay. It’s decisively mid-tier, which is a
              bit embarrassing for a modern green-field project. They had an opportunity to do better than this, and
              they blew it, and  of these issues are downstream of the decision to standardize on
              multiple return values as the idiomatic way to handle errors.
            
              I’ll put my own take on what Go’s error handling should have been like in here since it’s my blog post and
              you cannot stop me. I’m sure some people will heavily disagree. That’s fine. I think that if Go had
              standardized around this approach to error handling everyone would’ve gotten used to it.
            
              Simple, just define a  type that has a  method or operator
              defined on it that either just passes the value or (if an error is present) wraps it and
              returns from the function.
              You can bikeshed the hell out of this one. Make it a postfix operator instead of a method, if you want.
              Write  or  to make it stand out more, I don’t care.
            Vastly better interactions with generics.
                Allows you to store  in slices and pass it around however you please.
              Better for static analysis.Less verbose, if you care about that. (I honestly don’t.)There’s not even a need for sum types if you don’t want them.
              In practice, it’s too late for invasive changes like that: Go has standardized on multiple return values
              for error handling, and trying to move away from that would be a fool’s errand.
            
              Since trying to move towards sum-type-based error handling is a nonstarter unless we want to split the
              language, let’s ask the obvious question: Is there anything that can be done to improve any of the issues
              outlined in this post?
            Can we at least promote multiple return values to full blown types and allow generics over them?Maybe. That’d be cool. I think it’d be an improvement.
              It’s not entirely trivial though, so let me write down some reasons why it’d be hard, and the changes
              that’d have to be made.
            
              You might say “But doesn’t Go have strong backwards compatibility guarantees?” Yeah, it does. That’s what
              makes it hard. If you could just change stuff however you want, it’d be easy.
            
              That said, even Go 1.22 made a pretty
              significant change. You can get pretty far as long as you’re willing to say “Old code will continue to
              mean exactly what it means today: the fix only applies to new or updated code.”,  you provide
              tools to auto-fix code during a migration from Go 1.N to Go 1.(N+1).
            In other words, it doesn’t sound impossible.
              In Go, multiple return values are ‘unpacked’ via . This makes the following
              code syntactically ambiguous due to the optional presence value you can extract from maps:
            
              Is this a problem? Eeeeh. It looks like one, but it’s to resolve by just picking one. Since tuples don’t
              exist in previous versions of Go, old code is just not affected.
            Multiple Return Value passingPassing multiple return values to a variadic function is currently legal Go code:
              Does this pass the tuple  to bar as the first argument, or does it automatically unpack
               to pass the fields as first and second argument?
            
              Moving away from auto-unpacking would be a breaking change, but if we don’t move away from it then
              .
            
              The modern solution to that is pretty simple: First, allow tuples to be unpacked like slices are (i.e. you
              have to write  to unpack the tuple). Second, add  and
               commands that identify this issue and fix it when upgrading to the most recent edition
              of Go.
            
              Honestly? I thought this would be hard, but as far as language changes go, this seems pretty easy, all
              things considered.
            
              If you want to dig deeper into this, you can find
              a bunch of
              similar Github
              issues on these topics. I stumbled
              upon them when doing research for this blog, I’ve not participated in any of them.
            Maybe I should, though. It would be  to see this one issue finally resolved.
              I don’t know for sure how Go ended up in this weird state with ‘multiple return values’, where it’s
              impossible to pass function results through a channel or into a slice.
            That one is still baffling to me, so here’s me trying to make sense of it.
              My understanding is that multiple return values were part of Go before its public release. Even in the
              Weekly Snapshot History that goes all the
              way back to 2009, there’s only a single mention of multiple return values way back in 2010: “cgo: correct
              multiple return value function invocations (thanks Christian Himpel)”.I imagine the situation played out as follows:
              First of all, multiple return values entered the language . Perhaps via the
               operator, since someone figured that using a traditional
              for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)-style loop just to iterate over the elements of an array or
              map is too error prone, or perhaps just as a convenience feature.
            
              Then, the gates of hell opened, demons attacked and the world of programming was set back—no, sorry, I am
              kidding.
            
              I assume that what actually happened is that multiple return values were just  and
              quickly became the idiomatic ‘gold-standard’ for error handling, passing values around, and so on.
            
              At this point I’m sure that someone asked “Hey, why don’t we just promote those to a full-blown tuple
              type?”, and was shot down with something like “We already have . There should be a
              single way of doing things. Go is a simple language. Why would we want to have two features that do the
              same thing?”
            
              In either case, at this point multiple return values were here to stay, and the feature established itself
              as the standard for error handling.
            
              Looking at the oldest internal discussions in Google’s ‘Golang Nuts’ group (just one or three days after
              the first
              announcement)
              is interesting. Say
              here or
              here. I
              mean it! Go and take a look. Lines such as “Go doesn’t have nullable types, we haven’t seen a lot of
              demand for them” really puts things into perspective.
            
              Give it a few years and we enter the present day, and Go is struggling with some of its earliest design
              decisions. (Evidence: This entire post. Also,
              generic methods are still
              impossible.)
            
              Go has these weird special cases (e.g. multiple return values, named return values), decided that ‘and’
              and ‘or’ are close enough (they even made that mistake twice), and many of these problems were intentional design decisions or avoidable.
            
              The ‘avoidable’ part is a big deal for me. It just feels like a lot of pain could’ve been avoided if Go
              had spent slightly more time thinking about programming language design.
            
              Going out on a limb, to me it looks like many of the issues boil down to the question of whether you take
              types seriously, and are willing to dig into the bare minimum of abstractions to figure out how certain
              features need to be designed, instead of just making things up as you ™.
            
              I don’t want to shill for Rust , but one thing that language did well is that it
               and designed itself around its type system.
             is how it got memory safety without a garbage collector. By
              moving that information to the type system. This is exactly, intentionally the road that Go
              didn’t pick.
            
              Go instead got…multiple return values, which are specifically, intentionally
              not a type in their own right to keep the language simple. I think this was a bad decision. When
              it’s easy to codify an abstraction as a type, you  codify it as a type. Go is still
              learning that lesson today.
            
              To go out on a positive note—I just spent a whole post complaining about Go, after all—I think that Go is
              an impressive technical achievement, and set the modern gold standard as far as tooling goes. I am
              grateful for that. I also really have to respect that its simplicity keeps perfectionism at bay.
            
              Someday I want to write a post about what I like about Go, but that day is not today. I’ll cross my
              fingers that tuples are going to be on the list by then.

InfoWorld writes that "The initiative promises dramatic improvements in editor startup speed, build times, and memory usage, making it easier to scale TypeScript to large code bases, Microsoft said."

Microsoft's TypeScript team expects to be able to preview command-line type-checking in Go-based tsc by mid-2025, and to deliver a feature-complete Go implementation of TypeScript by the end of the year. [You can build and run the Go code now from Microsoft's new working repository.]
 Developers who use Go-based TypeScript in the Visual Studio Code editor will feel the increased speed in the editor, Microsoft said. The company promises an 8x improvement in project load times, instant comprehensive error listings across entire projects, and greater responsiveness for all language service operations including completion lists, quick information, go to definition, and find all references. The new TypeScript will also support more advanced refactoring and deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute, the company said. 

Microsoft believes native Go implementations reduce build times by up to 10x, notes Neowin. But "Developers can expect TypeScript 6.0 to have some deprecations and breaking changes to support the upcoming Go-based version."

Later this year, Microsoft will be releasing this new native Go implementation as TypeScript 7.0. The current JS-based TypeScript codebase will continue development into the 6.x series until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption, since some projects may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other things that are not supported by TypeScript 7+. 
TypeScript's original creator Anders Hejlsberg recorded an announcement video — and also shared his thoughts in a GitHub discussion titled simply... "Why Go?"
The TypeScript compiler's move to Go was influenced by specific technical requirements, such as the need for structural compatibility with the existing JavaScript-based codebase, ease of memory management, and the ability to handle complex graph processing efficiently. After evaluating numerous languages and making multiple prototypes — including in C# — Go emerged as the optimal choice... 
Let's be real. Microsoft using Go to write a compiler for TypeScript wouldn't have been possible or conceivable in years past. However, over the last few decades, we've seen Microsoft's strong and ongoing commitment to open-source software, prioritizing developer productivity and community collaboration above all. Our goal is to empower developers with the best tools available, unencumbered by internal politics or narrow constraints. This freedom to choose the right tool for each specific job ultimately benefits the entire developer community, driving innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes. And you can't argue with a 10x outcome! 

Hejlsberg also addressed their choice of Go in an online interview with the Michigan TypeScript meetup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Fashion Shopping with Nearest Neighbors</title><link>https://vibewall.shop/</link><author>unixpickle</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:33:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An error has occurred while loading the content.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Milk Kanban</title><link>https://brodzinski.com/2025/03/milk-kanban.html</link><author>ladronevincet</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:32:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When people say Kanban, they tend to think of a specific set of practices. Whiteboards & sticky notes (both almost universally virtual). Tasks moving through columns that represent workflow. Every now and then, WIP limits even.As often as we do it with other things, it reduces a broader principle to a set of oversimplified techniques, which, in turn, tend to underdeliver in many contexts.In its original meaning, Kanban represented a visual signal. The thing that communicated, well, something. It might have been a need, option, availability, capacity, request, etc.In our Kanban systems, the actual Kanban is a sticky note.It represents work, and given its closest environment (board, columns, other stickies, visual decorators), it communicates what needs, or needs not, to be done.If it’s yellow, it’s a regular feature. If there’s a blocker on it, it requests focus. If there’s a long queue of neighbors, it suggests flow inefficiency. If it’s a column named “ready for…” it communicates available work and/or handoff.A visual signal all the way.Let’s decouple ourselves from the most standard Kanban board design. Let’s forget columns, sticky notes, and all that jazz.Enters Kasia, our office manager at Lunar. One of the many things Kasia takes care of is making sure we don’t run out of kitchen supplies. The tricky part is that when you don’t drink milk yourself, it becomes a pain to check the cupboard with milk reserves every now and then to ensure we’re stocked.Then, one day, I found this.A simple index card taped to the last milk carton in a row stating, “Bring me to Kasia.” That’s it.In the context, it really says that:we’re running out of (specific kind of) milkthere’s enough time to make an order (we don’t drink that much of cappuccinos and macchiatos)But it’s just a visual signal. Kanban at its very core.What Kasia designed is a perfect Kanban system. It relies on visual signals, which are put in the context. Even better, unlike most Kanban boards I see across teams, the system is self-explanatory. Everything one needs to know is written on the index card.It’s a safe assumption that, almost always, there’s a simpler visualization that would work just as well. We, process designers, often fall into the trap of overengineering our tools.And it’s a healthy wake-up call when someone who knows close to nothing about our fancy stuff designs a system that we would unlikely think of. One that is a perfect implementation of the original spirit, even if it doesn’t follow any of the common techniques.That’s what we can learn from Milk Kanban.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpaceX launches astronauts for long-awaited International Space Station crew swap</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/spacex-launches-astronauts-for-long-awaited-international-space-station-crew-swap/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:13:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SpaceX successfully launched four people into space on Friday, beginning a mission that will give the International Space Station enough crew members to allow astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to return to Earth after their nine-month stay.

No? Think again. Have you noticed conflicting updates to the same data?In distributed systems, coordination is crucial. A distributed lock ensures that if one actor (node, service instance, etc.) changes a shared resource—like a database record, file, or external service—no other node can step in until the first node is finished.Today, we’ll try to discuss it and:By the end, you should have a decent grasp of distributed locks, enough to make informed decisions about whether (and how) to use them in your architecture.who’s in charge of updating shared data?For example, you might have:Multiple Writers are updating the same table row.That’s a common issue when updating read models.Without locks, you can get unpredictable states - like a read model flipping from correct to incorrect or a file partially overwritten by multiple workers. Locks sacrifice a bit of parallelism for the certainty that no two nodes update the same resource simultaneously. In many cases, that’s the safest trade-off, especially if data correctness is paramount.idempotent actionswrite-ahead logsIf no lock currently exists, the node creates one, for instance by setting a Redis key with a time-to-live or by creating an ephemeral zNode in ZooKeeper.If another node is holding the lock, this node either waits, fails immediately, or retries, depending on your chosen policy.Crash or Automatic ReleaseThe basic flow would look like:And the acquisition part with TTL handling:There are many tools for distributed locking; let's check the most popular for certain categories.Kubernetes Single-InstanceDistributed locks all share a common goal: ensure only one node does a particular thing at any given time. However, each tool mentioned approaches the problem with distinct designs, strengths, and failover behaviours.Let’s look at each tool’s big-picture purpose—why you’d even consider it—then move on to how it implements (or approximates) a lock. Lastly, let’s discuss a few technical details that matter once you start coding or troubleshooting.Redis runs all commands in a single thread, so there is no risk of two commands interfering partway through.Redis runs all commands in a single thread, so there is no risk of two commands interfering partway through. To create a lock, you need to create a “lock key” using a Redis command, for instance:SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30That looks cryptic, but let’s see what’s happening behind the scenes:Atomic Key Creation with NX. SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30Handling Network Partitions. Redlock algorithmChoosing Redis may be a good option if you already run a Redis cluster for caching or need a lightweight solution that’s easy to integrate. Performance is generally good, though absolute consistency under partitions can require more complex setups.ZooKeeper and etcd each run as a cluster of nodes that keep data consistent across a majority of them (a quorum).You create something like  in ZooKeeper or a key in etcd.When you’re done, you delete the ephemeral node or lease key, signalling that source is available.Other clients can “watch” that lock path. If the lock holder crashes, ZooKeeper or etcd detects the session loss and removes the node, instantly notifying watchers that the lock is free again. This allows any waiting client to move in and grab the lock right away.If a node is isolated from the quorum, ZooKeeper or etcd eventually considers that session dead and removes the ephemeral node. This auto-frees the lock. The newly updated cluster state reflects that the lock is available, so another node can pick it up.If your environment already depends on them for cluster metadata or leader election, reusing them for locks is natural. They replicate data across multiple servers, so updates to the lock state are consistent, reducing the risk of split-brain scenarios. The ephemeral mechanism automatically frees locks if a session dies, so you don’t end up with “zombie” locks after crashes.They offer stronger consistency guarantees at the cost of heavier operational overhead compared to Redis.Sometimes you’d rather avoid setting up additional infrastructure, like Redis or ZooKeeper, and simply rely on the single relational database you already use. Many SQL databases—PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and others—provide built-in locking features that can help you coordinate concurrency directly in your existing environment. There are generally two ways to handle locks in a relational database: “I want exclusive access to something”They serve different needs, but both let you say, “I want exclusive access to something,” using your existing DB.You can lock specific rows in a table by issuing something like:BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM locks WHERE lock_id = @loc_key FOR UPDATE;
/* make changes */
COMMIT;
That looks cryptic, but here’s what’s happening. “Lock this row so nobody else can modify it until I’m done.”The lock lasts until you commit or roll back the transaction.You may also use regular rows instead of a dedicated locks table. It’s natural if your concurrency problem revolves around specific table rows. For others you need to define key that would represent the scope of locking-- PostgreSQL
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(12345);
/* do something exclusive */
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(12345);
-- MySQL
SELECT GET_LOCK('readModel', 10);
/* do something exclusive */
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('readModel');
PostgreSQL Advisory LocksIn many cases, database locks require minimal setup. There’s no need to spin up Redis or ZooKeeper if you already trust a single relational DB for everything. You can use familiar SQL, which can benefit many developers. You get transaction integrations.Still, they’re tight to a single database scope.The other downside is lock contention.You also can get deadlocksSometimes, you don’t need a distributed lock at all—you just need to ensure there’s no possibility of concurrency. In Kubernetes, you can tell the cluster to run exactly one replica of your service. With only one pod, you don’t risk two pods writing to the same resource simultaneously. This approach is straightforward but also very limiting.StatefulSetNo Parallelism or scalingetcdetcdIn Kubernetes, the mechanisms and controllers designed to manage the number of pods are quite robust, but in highly dynamic or unusual situations, there might be brief moments where conditions could lead to more than one pod being created temporarily.Rapid Scale-Up and Scale-Down:Network Partitions or etcd Availability Issues:Why You’d Choose Single-Instance in Kubernetes?If you just need to enforce that there’s a single instance processing background job (read model handling, job processing) and you have Kubernetes set up, then it’s a decent choice. You remove the concurrency at all. You don’t spin up Redis or ZooKeeper just to handle locks.Still, the race conditions can be dangerous for high traffic or important cases. It’s not fully reliable.Here’s my recommended decision-making scheme for locking mechanism:If you have a single relational DB handling all app state, advisory locks might sufficeIf your environment already includes a Redis cluster for caching and you want a simpler ephemeral lock, Redis is a natural fit.If concurrency is never desired or is completely out of scope for a specific microservice, AND you’re using already Kubernetes a single-instance Kubernetes approach may be acceptable.If your microservices need advanced coordination (like leader election, watchers, or strongly consistent state), consider ZooKeeper or etcd. If your system needs to acquire multiple locks at once, you risk deadlocks (e.g., process A has Lock1 and wants Lock2; process B has Lock2 and wants Lock1). The best practice is to lock in a consistent order globally or use carefully designed transaction boundaries. I’ll show you next week how you could use queuing and single writer for that.Locks serialize access. If too many services fight for the same lock, your system effectively becomes single-threaded. To avoid bottlenecks, lock only the smallest critical sections. If concurrency at some granularity is acceptable, consider sharding or partitioned locks.If you rely on a single Redis instance or a single ZooKeeper node, your lock manager can fail. Always consider using a clustered or highly available setup, such as Redis with sentinel or cluster mode or a ZooKeeper ensemble of three or five nodes.Systems like Redlock try to handle partial failures, but no distributed lock can be 100% guaranteed if your network is severely partitioned (CAP theorem territory). You might end up with multiple holders, each believing they’re the only one. Proper design, timeouts, and conflict detection help reduce these edge cases.Try to avoid distributed locking if you can. Distributed systems will always have complexities, but a well-implemented distributed lock (or a strategic single-instance approach) can tame the chaos of concurrency—keeping your data consistent and your architecture stable.What are your experiences, use cases, and challenges with distributed locking?And hey, all the best for Christmas if you celebrate it. If you don’t, try to also get the chance to rest a bit. And if you  don’t want to, that’s fine, as long as you’re happy!p.s. Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion.

"The two renewable energy sources accounted for 17% of the country's power mix while coal fell to a low of 15%, it said."

Solar was the fastest-growing energy source, according to Ember's analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, increasing 27% from the year before, while wind rose 7%... Natural gas generation increased 3.3% in 2024, according to Ember, and remains by far the largest source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for 43% of the mix... 
California and Nevada both surpassed 30% annual share of solar in their electricity mix for the first time last year (32% and 30%, respectively). California's battery growth was key to its solar success. It installed 20% more battery capacity than it did solar capacity, which helped it transfer a significant share of its daytime solar to the evening. Texas installed more solar and battery capacity than even California. 

Yet the growth of solar was uneven — 28 states generated less than 5% of their electricity from solar in 2024, highlighting significant untapped potential — even before adding battery storage. 
The article includes this observation from Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember. "The fall in battery costs is a gamechanger for how much solar the U.S. electricity grid could integrate in the near future." 

Electrek notes that "After being stagnant for 14 years, electricity demand started rising in recent years and saw a 3% increase in 2024, marking the fifth-highest level of rise this century..."

Natural gas grew three times more than the decline in coal, increasing power sector CO2 emissions slightly (0.7%). Coal fell by the second smallest amount since 2014, as gas and clean energy growth met rising electricity demand, whereas historically, they have replaced coal. Despite growing emissions, the carbon intensity of electricity continued to decline. The rise in power demand was much faster than the rise in power sector CO2 emissions, making each unit of electricity likely the cleanest it has ever been.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ReactOS Can Now Boot With The Windows Audio Stack...

So far, Merz has seen a lot of advance praise, but how will his ambition to turn Germany from a “hesitant” to a “leading middle power” really be felt in Europe. How will he shape German relations with other EU countries? Will he get along with the European Commission?

It's also helped usher in political newcomer Mark Carney as the new Canadian prime minister and opened a window for Ontario's premier Doug Ford to step into the global conversation. Our editors in Ottawa and Toronto explore how this reaction to Trump is affecting everyday Canadian life and reshaping politics.

Charities that refurbish and distribute computers to low-income individuals must choose between providing soon-to-be-insecure Windows 10 machines, transitioning to Linux -- despite usability challenges for non-tech-savvy users -- or recycling the hardware, contributing to ewaste. Tom's Hardware reports: So how bad will it really be to run an end-of-lifed Windows 10? Should people worry? [Chester Wisniewski, who serves as Director and Global Field CISO for Sophos, a major security services company] and other experts I talked to are unequivocal. You're at risk. "To put this in perspective, today [the day we talked] was Patch Tuesday," he said. "There were 57 vulnerabilities, 6 of which have already been abused by criminals before the fixes were available. There were also 57 in February and 159 in January. Windows 10 and Windows 11 largely have a shared codebase, meaning most, if not all, vulnerabilities each month are exploitable on both OSs. These will be actively turned into digital weapons by criminals and nation-states alike and Windows 10 users will be somewhat defenseless against them."
 
So, in short, even though Windows 10 has been around since 2015, there are still massive security holes being patched. Even within the past few weeks, dozens of vulnerabilities were fixed by Microsoft. So what's a charity to do when these updates are running out and clients will be left vulnerable? "What we decided to do is one year ahead of the cutoff, we discontinued Windows 10," said Casey Sorensen, CEO of PCs for People, one of the U.S.'s largest non-profit computer refurbishers. "We will distribute Linux laptops that are 6th or 7th gen. If we distribute a Windows laptop, it will be 8th gen or newer." Sorensen said that any PC that's fifth gen or older will be sent to an ewaste recycler.
 
[...] Sorensen, who founded the company in 1998, told us that he's comfortable giving clients computers that run Linux Mint, a free OS that's based on Ubuntu. The latest version of Mint, version 22.1, will be supported until 2029. "Ten years ago if we distributed Linux, they would be like what is it," he said. But today, he notes that many view their computers as windows to the Internet and, for that, a user-friendly version of Linux is acceptable.

Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

The researchers were initially astonished by how effectively some of their interpretability methods seemed to uncover these hidden training objectives, although the methods are still under research.While the research involved models trained specifically to conceal information from automated software evaluators called reward models (RMs), the broader purpose of studying hidden objectives is to prevent future scenarios where AI systems might deceive or manipulate human users.While training a language model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reward models are typically tuned to score AI responses according to how well they align with human preferences. However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google is replacing Google Assistant with Gemini</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/google-is-replacing-google-assistant-with-gemini/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:49:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google will replace Google Assistant on Android phones with Gemini later this year, the company announced on Friday.

Why is an ‘open’ future controversial among theologians? If the future is not ‘settled’, if there is no certainty from God’s viewpoint of how future events will turn out, then God’s providence, could not be as sure. If the future is truly open, then not even God could know the future because there are no future facts to know.

Agnostics do not know whether or not God exists. Theists surmise they’re reprobates. Atheists suppose they’re cowards. Are there different kinds of agnostics? Can agnosticism deepen appreciation for God—what it would take to believe in God and what it would mean if indeed there were a God? A robust, energetic agnosticism is a credit to God if there is one.

According to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls "locs"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: "I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly."
 
The AI didn't stop at merely refusing -- it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities." [...] The developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username "janswist," expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after "just 1h of vibe coding" with the Pro Trial version. "Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs," the developer wrote. "Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding." One forum member replied, "never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing."
 
Cursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of "vibe coding" -- a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless "vibes-based" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A look at Firefox forks</title><link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1012453/</link><author>sohkamyung</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:25:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
We can admit it, marketing is not our strong suit. Our strength is

Linux world. Please subscribe today to help us keep doing that, and so
we don’t have to get good at marketing.

           By March 4, 2025Mozilla's actions have been rubbing many Firefox fans the
wrong way as of late, and inspiring them to look for alternatives.
There are many choices for users who are looking for a browser that
isn't part of the Chrome monoculture but is full-featured and suitable
for day-to-day use. For those who are willing to stay in the Firefox
"family" there are a number of good options that have taken vastly
different approaches. This includes GNU IceCat, Floorp, LibreWolf, and Zen.Mozilla has been disappointing a lot of Firefox users for years,
but it seems the pace is accelerating. Its announcement on
February 19 that it needs to "diversify" beyond Firefox did not
inspire confidence, and it annoyed many who would like to see Mozilla
go all-in on its flagship browser (and increase its market share)
rather than chasing AI or dabbling in advertising. But a recent and
more alarming example is its introduction of terms of use for the
browser and the removal of its pledge not to sell users' personal
data. Though it has backpedaled
somewhat since, and rewritten its terms of use, the damage has been
done.
Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it
flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come.
The GNU project also adopted the name IceWeasel for the GNUzilla
project—basically Mozilla source code with any non-free
code, such as the Adobe Flash
Player, stripped out. In 2007, Karl Berry announced
that GNUzilla would be adopting the name IceCat for its version
"not because we have anything against weasels" but to avoid
confusion with Debian's version.IceCat has the distinction of being the oldest Firefox fork still
in development. Ray Dryden applied
for GNUzilla to become part of the GNU Project in August 2005,
and test releases based on Firefox 1.5.0 were available later
that year. IceCat, as with all of the forks covered in this article,
is available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0. However, the
scripts and other tools used to create an IceCat release from Firefox
are licensed under the GPLv3.GNUzilla does not distribute binaries of IceCat. The project
recommends using GNU Guix to
install IceCat on x86_64 Linux systems, and also makes its scripts
available in its Git repository to
compile IceCat from Firefox's extended-support releases (ESRs). It
may, however, also be packaged for a user's favorite Linux
distribution. Fedora 41, for example, currently has
IceCat 115.20.0esr—which is based on Firefox 115.20.0;
both were released on February 4.Current-day IceCat has several changes that distinguish it from
Firefox. The most immediately obvious is its use of the LibreJS add-on to
block "nonfree nontrivial JavaScript while allowing JavaScript that
is free and/or trivial". In practice, this means that a significant 
number of sites will not work unless the user adds exceptions for
the JavaScript used by the site. Users can choose to add exceptions for
individual scripts blocked by LibreJS or to add an exception for the
entire site. Even LWN, which uses a minimal amount of JavaScript,
has scripts that are blocked by LibreJS.IceCat includes the JShelter
extension, which attempts to block not just malware, but browser fingerprinting
and user tracking as well. It modifies the JavaScript environment that
is available to web pages to try to confuse fingerprinters and make it
more difficult to carry out attacks using JavaScript. It may block
APIs or return fake values to thwart these attempts. Like LibreJS, it
can be modified or turned off
entirely for specific sites. There is a paper from 2022 that
explains the extension's approach in great detail, and an extensive FAQ that may be of use
in troubleshooting interactions between JShelter and web sites.In a similar vein, IceCat includes a fork of
the Third-party
Request Blocker extension that (as the name implies) blocks
connections to third-party resources without user consent. It is a
little concerning that the page
describing the extension describes it as "seemingly maintained by
'sw'", and its last update was in March 2020. The home page
listed for the extension is no longer available. Despite the lag in
development, it still seems to be working and blocking plenty of
third-party requests. A visit to a site like The Guardian, for instance, shows
seven sites blocked. As the screenshot shows, site layout and images
are often affected by IceCat's default settings. Usually the sites are
still usable, but far less aesthetically pleasing.One thing that worked well for me was to enable just enough
to see the page text and then use the reader view to read a site's
articles or other content. (Sadly, none of the forks offer a "browse
everything in reader view by default" option.)In all, IceCat ships with eight extensions that either attempt to
enhance user privacy, block non-free software, or unbreak sites that
are affected by its other extensions. It includes a "LibreJS/USPS
compatibility" plugin to offer an alternative shipping calculator for
the US Postal Service site as well as
an extension to replace JavaScript blocked by LibreJS on the Library
Genesis sites.The project has an extension-finder service called Mozzarella, which (of course)
only lists extensions that are free software. However, the extensions
may be outdated compared to their counterparts listed in Firefox's
add-on catalog. For example, the Privacy Badger extension in the Mozzarella
catalog was last updated in June 2023. The Firefox
catalog version was last updated on January 29, 2025.Right now, three people are listed as maintainers for GNUzilla:
Ruben Rodriguez, Amin Bandali, and Mark H. Weaver. The development
mailing lists are a bit on the quiet side. The last-archived
conversation currently for the gnuzilla-dev list is from
August 2024. The bug-gnuzilla
list is a little more lively—its last activity was in
December 2024.IceCat is probably a good choice for folks who are more concerned
with the free software ethos and privacy than with
functionality.The Floorp project is a much
newer entrant. It is developed by a community
of Japanese students called Ablaze. Development is hosted on GitHub,
and the project solicits donations
via GitHub donations. According to its donations page, donors who
contribute at the $100 level may submit ads to feature in the new tab
page—but the ads, which are displayed as shortcuts with a
"sponsored" label, can be turned off in the settings. I've been unable
to find any information about the project governance or legal
structure of Ablaze.Its contributors
page lists seven primary maintainers and 39 code contributors, as well as
many people who have contributed to its language packs and
translations, or who maintain packages. Floorp does not offer native
packages for Linux distributions, but it does provide a Flatpak via
Flathub and precompiled
releases for x86_64 and ARM64.Originally Floorp was based on Chromium but switched to Firefox in
early 2022. The first Firefox-derived version was Floorp v7 (announcement in
Japanese), and it was based on the Firefox rapid releases, but the
project switched to the ESR releases as their base with v8. The most
recent release, version 11.23.1, was announced on
February 15, and is based on (according to
) the Firefox ESR 128.8.0 release,
which came out on March 4. It would
be nice if the project were more explicit in its release notes about which
version of Firefox a release was based on. This is not merely for
curiosity's sake—it would help users track whether Floorp was
receiving the most recent security updates. The project has said that
it plans to
move back to the rapid release versions of Firefox with v12, which is
currently in beta.The project promises "strong tracking protection" and that
it does not track users or have any affiliation with advertising
companies. However, the project does not give details on how its
tracking protection differs from Firefox's. It still uses Google as
its default search engine and includes the Firefox
browser sync feature. It also uses Mozilla's add-ons repository,
and should work with most Firefox add-ons
that are compatible with the corresponding Firefox version.Floorp does have a number of interesting features and enhancements
that may tempt users. It has a dual-sidebar layout that allows users
to access bookmarks, history, and other tools on the left-hand side,
while the right-hand has the Web Apps panel. Users can add web sites
to open in the Web Apps panel, which can be useful while (for example)
doing research for an article while keeping a version of the article
open in the panel.In addition to the Apps panel, Floorp has a split-view feature that
lets users open two pages side-by-side by selecting a tab and clicking
"Split this Tab". Each split has its own history and URL bar. Floorp's
layout is great for wide-screen monitors, and I like the ability to
open sites in split view rather than juggling multiple browser
windows.Another interesting inclusion in Floorp is its Workspace
feature. This allows users to group tabs by categories like
"work", "comics", "shopping", or whatever makes sense for the users'
browsing habits. I've found this useful for working on projects and
stories for LWN—I might have a dozen tabs open for a specific
story, which I can group into a single workspace. Workspaces can also
be assigned to Firefox's multi-account
containers. For example, a user might want to log in to the same
site using different accounts—without having to sign in and out
repeatedly. Combining the workspace and multi-account containers can
be useful in a number of scenarios.Firefox's tabs have seen little feature advancement in the past few
years. Floorp adds a few much-needed enhancements here, allowing users
to move the tab bar to the bottom of the window, use a multi-row tab
bar, and even a vertical tab bar. However, the Floorp implementation
of the vertical tab bar will go away in v12, now that Mozilla has
finally
added vertical tabs in Firefox 136.0.Overall, Floorp is an interesting project with some nice
enhancements to the Firefox UI. However, the development roadmap seems
a bit more haphazard than I would like—switching back and forth
between Firefox rapid release and ESRs, for example. That may not
dissuade other folks, though.The LibreWolf project got its start in 2020. Its focus is primarily
around privacy, security, and the removal of ""
features, such as telemetry and DRM, from Firefox. It lists seven core
contributors on its home page and points to its Matrix room for
development discussions. Its development is hosted on Codeberg.LibreWolf has the normal configuration options one would expect for
a Firefox fork, but it also has the option of using a special
configuration file called  to set
preferences that can take effect across multiple profiles rather than
having to tweak the configuration for each profile. It also makes
preferences easy to back up and move to a new machine. The documentation explains
where to find this file, depending on the installation method, and offers
several suggestions for possible preference changes.LibreWolf is mostly notable for what it  have
rather than what it does. That is, it removes other features from
Firefox that have not been well-received by many users such as Pocket
integration, telemetry, and more. Firefox Sync is disabled by default
but it can be enabled in settings.LibreWolf does include the uBlock Origin add-blocker add-on
as part of its standard installation. It should be noted that uBlock
Origin is being disabled
for Chrome users as Google phases
out support for the WebExtension
API V2 in favor of V3, which will curtail features that uBlock
Origin and other add-ons require to function. To its credit, Mozilla
has committed
to continuing its support for Manifest V2 and V3. LWN covered Manifest V3 and
its impact on content blockers in 2021.For the most part, users would be hard-pressed to spot many
differences between LibreWolf and Firefox at first (or second) glance,
so a screen shot of LibreWolf seemed a bit unnecessary. That approach
is likely to appeal to many users who are uneasy with things like
telemetry and Pocket, but don't want an entirely new browsing
experience.The Zen browser project is the most recent entrant. Its development
began last year with an
announcement on Reddit. It is currently in beta, with its most
recent version, 1.8.2b
based on Firefox 135.0.1, released on
February 25. Kudos to the Zen project, by the way, for
proudly including the Firefox version alongside the project version in
its "About" dialog—information that literally every other
Firefox fork seems intent on hiding. Zen lists 12 people in the main
project team, and about 90 contributors to the
browser. Development for Zen is hosted on GitHub,
and discussion takes place on Discord (link goes
to a Discord invitation).Like Floorp, the project solicits donations to
assist with development, but little information seems to be available
about its governance or structure to provide transparency about how
the money is spent.Unlike the other forks, it is not immediately obvious that Zen is
an offshoot of Firefox. It does not look at all like the standard
Firefox interface, even before users start customizing it. Even
Floorp, which allows significant customization, still bears some
resemblance to Firefox on first use. Zen sports a tab sidebar on the
left that blends the Workspace concept from Floorp and vertical tabs,
with a set of default bookmarks ("Essentials") as icons at the
top. The browser menu is located in the top-left corner, indicated by
a button with three dots. The window title bar is hidden and only
appears if a user hovers the mouse at the top of the window for a few
seconds.While Zen looks modern and interesting, its sleek user interface
and configurability comes at the cost of intuitive usability in some
cases. For example, one might expect that setting Zen to light mode in
the "Language and Appearance" settings would also change the browser's
interface to light mode. It does not, as shown in the
screenshot. Instead, a user has to go to the "Add-ons and Themes"
settings to select a light theme. It would help a great deal if Zen's
user guide
were more complete, but it only has a little bit of documentation to
offer at the moment. To be fair, it is still a beta project, so it may
be much improved by the time the Zen browser has its first stable
release. For now, users will need to be ready to dig through Reddit
and other forums for tips.Features like glance, which pre-fetches a link and gives a preview
of it before opening it in a new tab or window, are useful, but not at
all obvious how to use, even if one is aware the feature exists. (On
Linux, activate glance with .) Likewise, Zen's
split-screen mode requires the user to select multiple tabs and then
right-click to select "Split Tab". Rearranging the splits is also not
intuitive. That said, the additional features are compelling if one is
willing to do some searching to figure things out.The Zen interface can be customized extensively to suit individual
tastes via the settings. If those options aren't enough, Zen has its
own set of add-ons and extensions called Mods to modify the interface
or add features. This ranges from a green-hued theme called Matcha to tweaks
to further minimize the sidebar. Most Firefox add-ons should work
with Zen as well, though some may clash with its user-interface
changes.Currently, Zen isn't fully baked enough for me to consider
switching to it. Others may be more adventurous in their
browsing habits than I am, though. I can say that it has stabilized
significantly since I first tried it shortly after its first public
release. The project does bear keeping an eye on, and the Mozilla
folks could do worse than to copy some of the ideas (and code) that
the project is experimenting with.The Firefox fork rabbit hole is surprisingly deep. There are a few
alternatives I chose not to try—but mention here for
completeness—and probably a few that I've missed. The Basilisk project
is a kind of retro-Firefox project that aims to retain technologies that
Firefox has removed. This includes the deprecated Netscape Plugin Application
Programming Interface (NPAPI) plugin support, ALSA support on
Linux, XUL extensions,
and more.The Pale Moon project is
another browser that has forked off of Mozilla Firefox code and no
longer tracks it directly. It uses
the Goanna
fork of the Gecko rendering engine and still supports NPAPI
plugins and XUL extensions. The project promises no telemetry or data
gathering. It offers a somewhat nostalgic look and feel
that is similar to Firefox in the mid-2000s.For those who pine for the days of the Netscape suite that included
the browser, mail client, HTML editor, IRC chat, and more, there is SeaMonkey. The project
uses code from Firefox and Thunderbird, though it is not directly
based on recent versions. According to its site, it backports security
fixes from Firefox and Thunderbird ESRs that apply to SeaMonkey. The
project also maintains the Composer HTML editor and ChatZilla IRC
client that are no longer maintained by Mozilla. SeaMonkey is still
packaged for a number of Linux distributions, and binaries are
available for Linux on x86_64 and x86 as a tarball. It might be a good
option for users who are still using 32-bit x86 Linux systems.Still dependent on MozillaRegardless which Firefox fork one chooses, it is important to
remember the downsides. First and foremost, all of the forks are
dependent on Mozilla to do the heavy lifting. The bulk of development
is carried by Mozilla, the direction of Firefox is set by Mozilla, and
choosing to run a fork puts the user one step removed from security
and bug fixes. This does not mean users shouldn't consider one
of these forks, but they should be aware of the potential
downsides.There is some precedent for soft forks displacing the original
upstream. For example, the Go-oo fork of
OpenOffice.org became LibreOffice after Oracle consumed Sun. That fork
has clearly overtaken OpenOffice.org in the Linux community as the
go-to desktop office suite and its development has eclipsed that of
its counterpart Apache OpenOffice. Go-oo, of course, had corporate
support as well as community support. For a Firefox fork to be truly
independent and sustainable, it would need a similar effort behind
it. Thus far, no such movement has materialized.A recent question on the LibreWolf issue tracker drives that point
home nicely. User "kallisti5" asked if
LibreWolf was prepared to fork Firefox "if Mozilla continues
farther down this path?" One of LibreWolf's contributors, "ohfp",
replied that the project was "absolutely not prepared to do
that" due to limited time and energy to work on the project as it
is. "We would not even remotely be able to fork and maintain a
browser fully, let alone to continually develop and improve
it."Another downside to the forks is that there are far fewer eyes on
their code and communities. When Mozilla makes an important move,
whether it's positive or negative, users are likely to hear about it
quickly. As of now, the forks get relatively little attention.Folks who want to jump ship from Mozilla's ecosystem entirely,
while still sticking to open source, have some options. Ladybird,
which LWN covered in
June last year, is an attempt to create a new browser from whole
cloth. It is an interesting effort, but not ready for day-to-day use
for most folks. Qutebrowser, Nyxt, and NetSurf are also worth a
look—though they may have some drawbacks for day-to-day use in
terms of site compatibility and features. We will take a look at some
of those options soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mesa RADV/RadeonSI Now Support RDNA4 GPUs With Radeon GPU Profiler</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-RDNA4-AMD-RGP</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 11:05:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Landing in Mesa 25.1 today for the RADV Vulkan and RadeonSI OpenGL drivers is Radeon GPU Profiler "RGP" integration for RDNA4/GFX12 GPUs with the newly-launched Radeon RX 9070 series...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Free95 0.2 Alpha Released As Open-Source Windows Compatible OS</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Free95-0.2-Alpha</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:40:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While ReactOS is widely known as the open-source operating system working on maintaining software and driver compatibility with Microsoft Windows, there's another new one in the field and it's Free95.

About Best Fancy Text Fonts
 have been in trend for a long time. Their most noticeable use is on social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Some of these fancy styles not only have aesthetics but are also attention-grabbing, which is why you might have encountered them while scrolling through your feeds. Below we have featured some of the coolest fonts that you can use to make your next text stylish.

Cursive also known as script font with its handwriting-like style makes it one of the most eye-pleasing text styles. Its flowing design can add a touch of elegance to your writing, making it perfect for highlighting specific parts of your text. For example, you can conclude a message with "𝒯𝒽𝒶𝓃𝓀 𝓎ℴ𝓊". Additionally, it works well for brief, heartfelt messages; for instance, sending a "𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 😊" to your mother would be a wonderful way to start her day.

Gothic font, also known as Fraktur or Blackletter, has the classic vibe of Old English text. With its sharp and angular design, it provides an aesthetic historical feel. Fraktur font has a bold and sophisticated appearance, making it an excellent choice for titles, headings, or for emphasizing parts of the text. For instance, you might wish your friend a great start to the season by writing, "𝕲𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖙 𝕭𝖊𝖌𝖌𝖎𝖓𝖎𝖓𝖌".

One of the most  created using Unicode symbols is the Bold font. We often feel the urge to make certain parts of our text bold to highlight their importance, but many online communities do not have this option. With the text generator, it’s now super easy to emphasize your text and copy-paste it in bold format. Simply enter the text you want to highlight and choose from many available options, including 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝘀-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱, 𝑩𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝑰𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒄, 𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝, and some cooler styles like 𝓢𝓬𝓻𝓲𝓹𝓽 and 𝕱𝖗𝖆𝖐𝖙𝖚𝖗. For example, you might share an inspiring quote "𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞." – 𝐔𝐧𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐧.

Monospace is a beautiful-looking font style with its characters taking up the same amount of horizontal space. Unlike other fonts with characters having varying widths, monospace characters maintain the same width. This type of text style can create a clean, minimalist appearance and adds a nostalgic typewriter feel. Monospace text can be useful when sharing lists, instructions, or information such as a URL, for example 𝚑𝚝𝚝𝚙𝚜://𝚎𝚡𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎.𝚌𝚘𝚖.𝚌𝚘𝚖/. It can enhance the clarity of your text.

Circled or bubble text is a cool-looking font style with each character enclosed in a circle. This font style gives a fun feel which makes it a good choice for informal and creative uses. It has two variants 🅓🅐🅡🅚 and normal Ⓑⓤⓑⓑⓛⓔ text style. It can add a cheerful touch to your social media posts, comments, or messages. For example, you could use it to announce something exciting on your Instagram page with a caption Ⓝⓔⓦ ⒶⓡⓡⓘⓥⒶⓛ or 🅒🅞🅝🅖🅡🅐🅣🅤🅛🅐🅣🅔 a close friend to make their day.

Square text is a modern-looking font style with each character being enclosed in a block. Its modern and striking look is a great way to capture attention on social media. You can create unique headlines and emphasize key points with this style. For example, you can use it to announce updates like 🆆🅸🅽🆃🅴🆁 🆂🅰🅻🅴 on your page or send fun messages to friends, such as 🅶🅾🅾🅳 🅽🅸🅶🅷🆃. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing look is a perfect way to add a trendy look to your text.
Uses of Copy and Paste Fonts
Our Stylish text generator can help you  for social media and make it fun for your chats. However, its applications extend beyond just fun; it can also be a valuable tool for business promotion, note-taking, and engaging in online communities. Here are some creative ways to use fancy text:

You have probably seen many people using Unicode text on social media. These text styles have become quite popular on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and X (Twitter). People use these styles to emphasize certain parts of their text or simply to add a creative or fun flair to it.

Instagram, more than any other platform, is where these cool symbols are most commonly used. Fonts like Cursive, Gothic, Bold, Bubble, and Monospace, etc. are among the top fonts being used on Insta. These fancy fonts have become so popular among Instagram users that they specifically search for an Instagram Font Generator. With the font gen tool, you can easily , write eye-catching comments, and add unique captions to your posts, helping you stand out.

Just like on Instagram, you can style your Facebook bio using this tool. Facebook allows for text-only posts as well, making it a great platform to emphasize keywords or add a creative flair with this tool. For example, you can use unique numbers like ❶❷❸. Additionally, these stylish Facebook fonts can be used in comments too, giving your interactions a fun feel.

Twitter (now known as X) is primarily used for posting text-only content called tweets. Since Twitter does not offer default text styling options, this font text generator can be your go-to tool for . You can bold your text, underline it, italicize it, or even change its font completely using styles like Monospace.
You can make your WhatsApp or other chats more fun and engaging by using stylish text. For instance, to stress a key point, try strong fonts like "𝐁𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐩 𝟏𝟎𝐩𝐦." Make your greetings special with something like "𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 🌤️." When sending invitations, sprinkle in these unique text styles or save them for a personal signature, such as "– 𝒀𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒃𝒓𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓." Plus, in group chats, these eye-catching fonts can help you stand out.

Styling text is not just for alphabets, you can take it a step further by making your number stylish. The next time you create a list in your notes or post on social media, consider using circled numbers like ❶❷❸ for a unique effect. When sharing a date, you can enhance it by writing it as "Join Us on 𝟐𝟖𝐭𝐡 𝐉𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲." You can use cool numbers for announcements or for countdowns such as "⑤ days to go." To copy fancy , simply enter the digits in the text box and choose from different fonts.

If you run an online business, you can create eye-catching promotional headlines with stylish fonts for your page, website, or email campaigns. Announce your new products with creativity, like, "𝓝𝓮𝔀 𝓗𝓪𝓲𝓻 𝓞𝓲𝓵 𝓲𝓷 𝓢𝓽𝓸𝓻𝓮!" or highlight discounts with impact, such as "𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐭 𝟓𝟎% 𝐎𝐟𝐟." Promote your webinars and include compelling calls to action in your posts or ads, like "👉 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐔𝐩." These copy-paste fonts make it easy to grab attention in your promotional content.

Text symbols can add a spark of fun to your educational experience. When writing notes in a simple app, you can highlight key concepts and craft creative headings. You can also write inspiring quotes in bold to motivate yourself throughout your studies. Class representatives can highlight important announcements by using strong fonts, ensuring everyone takes notice. Teachers can also add a special touch by celebrating the class topper with a fancy script.

Use this tool as your fancy name generator to create a stylish version of your name or any other name you choose. You can add a creative touch by selecting cursive, bold, or various other font styles. The awesome part is that your  won't just be for preview; you can use it anywhere Unicode is supported.

Font generator is an online tool where you can type in regular text and it turns it into fancy styles for copying and pasting. It works by mixing in various stylish Unicode symbols that look similar to normal letters, giving your text a fun and cool look.

Copy and paste fonts are made using aesthetic Unicode characters. Unicode is a Universal standard that gives each character a unique code so it looks the same on all platforms.

No, screen readers won't be able to read these text styles effectively. These symbols might look the same as Normal letters but they can have different underlying meanings. Use these styles only when you are sure that your audience does not include individuals using screen readers.

Instagram allows users to change fonts in stories, but unfortunately, there are no built-in options to modify fonts in bios or captions. However, you can easily achieve this by using a third-party tool like the font generator.

Text fonts can be used anywhere Unicode is supported. This includes a variety of platforms such as popular social media sites, messaging applications, documents, websites, emails, and many others.

Facebook does not offer built-in font formatting options. However, you can easily use a fancy font generator to create bold, italic, or underlined text, as well as change your font style completely.

You can easily change your WhatsApp text to bold, italic, monospace, or strikethrough by selecting the text and choosing the formatting options from the menu. If you want to explore more styling options, simply enter your message in the font changer and select your desired style.

Although Twitter is a text-focused platform it does not provide formatting options. If you want to change the font in your tweets or bio, you can use this tool as your Twitter text formatter. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Nash, I made a standalone note with single HTML file</title><link>https://keepworking.github.io/nash/</link><author>yevgenyhong</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 01:51:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello HN,

I have a problem with the implication that there is One True Metric of productivity that you can standardize and sort people by. Consider the magnitude of skills and experiences at play: What adjacent skills, market segments, and product subject matter expertise are you drawing upon? Design, security, compliance, data visualization, marketing, finance? What stage of development? What scale of usage?

If successful, it could serve as an alternative to the chokepoint at the Suez Canal in Egypt. Turkey, Qatar and the UAE have all expressed support for the megaproject, but geopolitical tensions in the region are complicated, with some of its neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China being part of their own competing trade routes. Baghdad also has to navigate political instability within its own borders amongst rivalling factions.

The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself.

To do good theology, religion must speak with science if only to avoid the embarrassment of supernatural explanations when natural explanations are doing just fine. If religion claims to be an approach to the entirety of existence, then it must embed the discoveries and insights of science. Religion has no choice. At its own risk, religion ignores science.

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTS5o8uYGpY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cTS5o8uYGpY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

"I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck."Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's late-2024 hiring of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish "to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future."

Spend a few weeks with WWE and you'll see how many tastes the product caters to. Segments can lean into different genres, such as drama, action, comedy, or even horror. Matches themselves are meant to capture a broad spectrum of styles, from Luchadors hitting highspots, to grueling submission matches to storybook endings by way of title matches that took years to build toward. The idea is to offer different styles and flavors to different segments of the audience. WWE 2K25 translates all of this variety very well, offering up many game modes, most of them worthwhile and often attracting different types of players. There are some flops on the card, but overall, this remains another main event-level display.WWE 2K25 is a great game in its own right and feels like the culmination of several years of effort to fix the series by the Visual Concepts team. WWE 2K20 was so bad and went so viral for that reason that the following year, the game didn't launch a new version--that's virtually unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and ) games. It clearly helped. Since then, it's been slowly and steadily improving year over year, making WWE 2K25 the best game in the series.In the ring, the biggest change is the addition of intergender matches. In the indie wrestling world, it's very common to have men and women wrestle each other without any added drama or lampshading. Promotions simply depict the competitors as equals--save for someone working heel who might call attention to it, of course. But WWE has long avoided similar matchups. This year, the studio finally got the go-ahead from the wrestling behemoth, so you can now, in one surely popular example, play as Rhea Ripley and squash Dominik Mysterio ad nauseam. It's great to see WWE becoming more comfortable with this idea and breaking down that needless barrier in its video game.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Klein, AT&amp;T whistleblower who revealed NSA mass spying, has died</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/memoriam-mark-klein-att-whistleblower-about-nsa-mass-spying</link><author>leotravis10</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:05:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?” We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&T’s central office in San Francisco, called Room 641A. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—made a copy of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.A photo of the NSA-controlled 'secret room' in the AT&T facility in San Francisco (Credit: Mark Klein)Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator Chris Dodd, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tourMark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013. But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.And the fight is not over. The law, called Section 702, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Time Portal – Get dropped into history, guess where you landed</title><link>https://www.eggnog.ai/entertimeportal</link><author>samplank2</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 20:23:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google’s new robot AI can fold delicate origami, close zipper bags without damage</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apollo_humanoid_robot-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:38:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Google DeepMind announced two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, maybe not always), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a moonshot goal of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its Gemini 2.0 large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft goes nuclear on TypeScript codebase…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ2WjtaPfXU</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PQ2WjtaPfXU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:10:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 3 months of Sentry’s team plan free https://bit.ly/3Fs19Oj

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peer-to-peer file transfers in the browser</title><link>https://github.com/kern/filepizza</link><author>keepamovin</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mercedes-Benz Drives Toward Solid-State EV Batteries</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/mercedes-benz</link><author>Lawrence Ulrich</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Njc2OTUwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODU2NTg0NX0.kWQaB9dF0zGesDWKBhA70-XztMQk1cdzlWVpWCNBs7E/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Factorial Energy's semi-solid-state cells could be in EVs in a few years]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can a New Power Link Boost the EU’s Energy Independence?</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/black-sea-energy-link</link><author>Amos Zeeberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjY2NzY1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDMyNTE5NH0.hL7VXlZjYYVXlowC14gTHx1atEgcdIKzlIAmDPaCrgk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Undersea cable would supply clean electricity from the Caucasus]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Metadata routing in scikit-learn</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_-Aja-slA</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lQ_-Aja-slA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:30:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Metadata routing is a relatively new feature that allows you to, as the name implies, route metadata to different components in your machine learning setup. It's especially useful for things like sample_weight, which require data per row of your input to be passed along. But you can imagine many elaborate usecases such as (custom) estimators but also (custom) scorers. This video explains how they work.

These satellites were built by AAC Clyde Space which has offices in the UK, Sweden and a few other countries. They orbit 517 - 550 KM above the Earth's surface and have a spatial resolution at nadir (GSD) of 5.3M.SpaceX launched all three of their satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. They were launched on April 15th, June 12th and November 11th, 2023 respectively.There are ~130 GB of GeoTIFFs being hosted in their AWS S3 bucket in Montreal. The 33 images posted were taken between June and two weeks ago.In this post, I'll examine Wyvern's open data feed.I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and I use ArcGIS Pro from time to time which only supports Windows natively.I'll use GDAL 3.9.3, Python 3.12.3 and a few other tools to help analyse the data in this post.$sudoadd-apt-repositoryppa:deadsnakes/ppa

The maps in this post were rendered with QGIS version 3.42. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.I used QGIS' Tile+ plugin to add geospatial context with Bing's Virtual Earth Basemap as well as CARTO's to the maps. The dark, non-satellite imagery maps are mostly made up of vector data from Natural Earth and Overture.Below is PulseOrbital's list of estimated Tallinn flyovers by Wyvern's Dragonette constellation for March 8th and 9th, 2025.Below I'll try to estimate the current locations of each of their three satellites. I found the Two-line elements (TLE) details on n2yo.I ran the following on March 10th, 2025. It produced a CSV file with names and estimated locations of their three satellites. \
                                   \
                                   \
                                  Below is a rendering of the above CSV data in QGIS.Wyvern have a STAC catalog listing the imagery locations and metadata around their capture. I'll download this metadata and get each image's address details with Mapbox's reverse geocoding service. Mapbox offer 100K geocoding searches per month with their free tier.The above produced a 33-line JSONL file. Below is an example record.$head-n1enriched.jsonjq-S.
I'll load their imagery metadata into DuckDB for analysis.Below are the image counts by country and city. Some areas are rural and Mapbox didn't attribute any city to the image footprint's location.┌──────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐

The Responses API will eventually replace the current Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that scan company files with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and navigate websites -- similar to functions available through OpenAI's Operator agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.
 
However, OpenAI acknowledges that its CUA model is not yet reliable for automating tasks on operating systems and can make unintended mistakes. The company describes the new API as an early iteration that it will continue to improve over time. Developers using the Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. These models can browse the web to answer questions and cite sources in their responses. That's notable because OpenAI says the added web search ability dramatically improves the factual accuracy of its AI models. On OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark, which aims to measure confabulation rate, GPT-4o search scored 90 percent, while GPT-4o mini search achieved 88 percent -- both substantially outperforming the larger GPT-4.5 model without search, which scored 63 percent.
 
Despite these improvements, the technology still has significant limitations. Aside from issues with CUA properly navigating websites, the improved search capability doesn't completely solve the problem of AI confabulations, with GPT-4o search still making factual mistakes 10 percent of the time. Alongside the Responses API, OpenAI released the open source Agents SDK, providing developers free tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities. This toolkit follows OpenAI's earlier release of Swarm, a framework for orchestrating multiple agents.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: XPipe, a shell connection hub for SSH, Docker, K8s, VMs, and more</title><link>https://xpipe.io/</link><author>crschnick</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:16:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A connection hub to keep track and manage of all your remote connections in one placeA terminal launcher that can launch you into a shell session in your favorite terminal instantlyComplete SSH support, including config files, agent integrations, jump servers, tunnels, key files, smartcards, X11 forwarding, and moreIntegrations for various container runtimes like Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, LXD, incus, plus environments like WSL, Cygwin, MSYS2Support for hypervisors like Proxmox, Hyper-V, KVM, VMware workstation, and more]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: VSC – An open source 3D Rendering Engine in C++</title><link>https://github.com/WW92030-STORAGE/VSC</link><author>NormalExisting</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:08:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Been making this rasterizer engine in C++ for the past few months, now also adding ray-tracing functionality to the system.Simply load a model or generate a mesh, add some lights, and render.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Origins of Jim Crow</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-origins-of-jim-crow</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67cf1c54d64d9d8e86eefa65/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BsnePbprmy9HgeeTXRDwUqmLjz6BLGqp2UScy-aVocY" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Jim Crow era is one of the darkest periods in American history.

the leaders of its various Special Interest Groups (SIGs). This time, we focus on
,
the group responsible for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on
Kubernetes. Sandipan Panda
(DevZero) had the opportunity to interview Maciej
Szulik (Defense Unicorns) and Janet
Kuo (Google), the chairs and tech leads of
SIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application
management within the Kubernetes ecosystem.Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey
within the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps?: Hey, my name is Maciej, and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you
can also find me helping
SIG CLI and also being one of
the Steering Committee members. I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various
areas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl.: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved
with the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an
amazing journey!My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My
journey with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding
rolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly
involved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles.All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet.Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives?
What key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem?As described in our
charter, we cover a
broad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in
short, means we’re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the
ups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes.Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken
by SIG Apps?At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the
challenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It’s worth giving credit here to two
working groups we’ve sponsored over the past years:Best practices and challengesSandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for
Kubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application
lifecycle management?Implementing health checks and readiness probes
ensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved
reliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing
solutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and
resolve issues quickly.Auto-scale your application based
on resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your
application can handle varying loads.Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job
and CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use
Operators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and
lifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual
intervention.Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them?The biggest challenge we’re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and
improvements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons
behind those decisions.Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any
recent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial
for SIG Apps?The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend
kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions
and the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to
achieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven’t
considered or weren’t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes.Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG
Apps, and what advice would you give them?We get the question, "What good first issue might you recommend we start with?" a lot :-) But
unfortunately, there’s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start
contributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read
through the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that
controller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your
breakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want
to search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining
the problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix.Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to
understand all the edge cases we’ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you’re
successful with one controller, you’ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again.Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback
integrated into your work?We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our
bi-weekly meetings. As long
as you’re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback
about any of the core controllers, we’re always happy to hear from everyone.Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management
within Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends?Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working
groups, each covering a different aspect of it.Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG?Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on
Slack, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull
requests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes
great!SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are
deployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving
innovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of
modern application developers and operators. Whether you’re a new contributor or an experienced
developer, there’s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact.If you’re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their SIG
README and join their bi-weekly meetings.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Traversal-resistant file APIs</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/osroot</link><author>Damien Neil</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Dev - Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A path traversal vulnerability arises when an attacker can trick a program
into opening a file other than the one it intended.
This post explains this class of vulnerability,
some existing defenses against it, and describes how the new
 API added in Go 1.24 provides
a simple and robust defense against unintentional path traversal.“Path traversal” covers a number of related attacks following a common pattern:
A program attempts to open a file in some known location, but an attacker causes
it to open a file in a different location.If the attacker controls part of the filename, they may be able to use relative
directory components ("..") to escape the intended location:f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "../../../../etc/passwd"))
On Windows systems, some names have special meaning:// f will print to the console.
f, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "CONOUT$"))
If the attacker controls part of the local filesystem, they may be able to use
symbolic links to cause a program to access the wrong file:// Attacker links /home/user/.config to /home/otheruser/.config:
err := os.WriteFile("/home/user/.config/foo", config, 0o666)
If the program defends against symlink traversal by first verifying that the intended file
does not contain any symlinks, it may still be vulnerable to
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) races,
where the attacker creates a symlink after the program’s check:// Validate the path before use.
cleaned, err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(unsafePath)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
if !filepath.IsLocal(cleaned) {
  return errors.New("unsafe path")
}

// Attacker replaces part of the path with a symlink.
// The Open call follows the symlink:
f, err := os.Open(cleaned)
Another variety of TOCTOU race involves moving a directory that forms part of a path
mid-traversal. For example, the attacker provides a path such as “a/b/c/../../etc/passwd”,
and renames “a/b/c” to “a/b” while the open operation is in progress.Before we tackle path traversal attacks in general, let’s start with path sanitization.
When a program’s threat model does not include attackers with access to the local file system,
it can be sufficient to validate untrusted input paths before use.Unfortunately, sanitizing paths can be surprisingly tricky,
especially for portable programs that must handle both Unix and Windows paths.
For example, on Windows  reports ,
because the path “\foo” is relative to the current drive.In Go 1.20, we added the 
function, which reports whether a path is “local”. A “local” path is one which:does not escape the directory in which it is evaluated ("../etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not an absolute path ("/etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not empty ("" is not allowed);on Windows, is not a reserved name (“COM1” is not allowed).In Go 1.23, we added the 
function, which converts a /-separated path into a local operating system path.Programs that accept and operate on potentially attacker-controlled paths should almost
always use  or  to validate or sanitize those paths.Path sanitization is not sufficient when attackers may have access to part of
the local filesystem.Multi-user systems are uncommon these days, but attacker access to the filesystem
can still occur in a variety of ways.
An unarchiving utility that extracts a tar or zip file may be induced
to extract a symbolic link and then extract a file name that traverses that link.
A container runtime may give untrusted code access to a portion of the local filesystem.Programs may defend against unintended symlink traversal by using the
path/filepath.EvalSymlinks
function to resolve links in untrusted names before validation, but as described
above this two-step process is vulnerable to TOCTOU races.Before Go 1.24, the safer option was to use a package such as
github.com/google/safeopen,
that provides path traversal-resistant functions for opening a potentially-untrusted
filename within a specific directory.In Go 1.24, we are introducing new APIs in the  package to safely open
a file in a location in a traversal-resistent fashion.The new  type represents a directory somewhere
in the local filesystem. Open a root with the 
function:root, err := os.OpenRoot("/some/root/directory")
if err != nil {
  return err
}
defer root.Close()
 provides methods to operate on files within the root.
These methods all accept filenames relative to the root,
and disallow any operations that would escape from the root either
using relative path components ("..") or symlinks.f, err := root.Open("path/to/file")
 permits relative path components and symlinks that do not escape the root.
For example,  is permitted. Filenames are resolved using the
semantics of the local platform: On Unix systems, this will follow
any symlink in “a” (so long as that link does not escape the root);
while on Windows systems this will open “b” (even if “a” does not exist). currently provides the following set of operations:func (*Root) Create(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) Lstat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
func (*Root) Mkdir(string, fs.FileMode) error
func (*Root) Open(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenFile(string, int, fs.FileMode) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenRoot(string) (*Root, error)
func (*Root) Remove(string) error
func (*Root) Stat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
In addition to the  type, the new
 function
provides a simple way to open a potentially-untrusted filename within a
specific directory:f, err := os.OpenInRoot("/some/root/directory", untrustedFilename)
The  type provides a simple, safe, portable API for operating with untrusted filenames.Caveats and considerationsOn Unix systems,  is implemented using the  family of system calls.
A  contains a file descriptor referencing its root directory and will track that
directory across renames or deletion. defends against symlink traversal but does not limit traversal
of mount points. For example,  does not prevent traversal of
Linux bind mounts. Our threat model is that  defends against
filesystem constructs that may be created by ordinary users (such
as symlinks), but does not handle ones that require root privileges
to create (such as bind mounts).On Windows,  opens a handle referencing its root directory.
The open handle prevents that directory from being renamed or deleted until the  is closed. prevents access to reserved Windows device names such as  and .On WASI, the  package uses the WASI preview 1 filesystem API,
which are intended to provide traversal-resistent filesystem access.
Not all WASI implementations fully support filesystem sandboxing,
however, and ’s defense against traversal is limited to that provided
by the WASI impementation.When GOOS=js, the  package uses the Node.js file system API.
This API does not include the openat family of functions,
and so  is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) races in symlink
validation on this platform.When GOOS=js, a  references a directory name rather than a file descriptor,
and does not track directories across renames.Plan 9 does not have symlinks.
On Plan 9, a  references a directory name and performs lexical sanitization of
filenames. operations on filenames containing many directory components can be much more expensive
than the equivalent non- operation. Resolving “..” components can also be expensive.
Programs that want to limit the cost of filesystem operations can use  to
remove “..” components from input filenames, and may want to limit the number of
directory components.You should use  or  if:you are opening a file in a directory; ANDthe operation should not access a file outside that directory.For example, an archive extractor writing files to an output directory should use
, because the filenames are potentially untrusted and it would be incorrect
to write a file outside the output directory.However, a command-line program that writes output to a user-specified location
should not use , because the filename is not untrusted and may
refer to anywhere on the filesystem.As a good rule of thumb, code which calls  to combine a fixed directory
and an externally-provided filename should probably use  instead.// This might open a file not located in baseDirectory.
f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(baseDirectory, filename))

// This will only open files under baseDirectory.
f, err := os.OpenInRoot(baseDirectory, filename)
The  API is new in Go 1.24.
We expect to make additions and refinements to it in future releases.The current implementation prioritizes correctness and safety over performance.
Future versions will take advantage of platform-specific APIs, such as
Linux’s , to improve performance where possible.There are a number of filesystem operations which  does not support yet, such as
creating symbolic links and renaming files. Where possible, we will add support for these
operations. A list of additional functions in progress is in

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Pixel Watch Knows When Your Heart Stops Beating</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/heart-attack-smartwatch</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjcwNTY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mjg3MTEyOH0.GzE5L4Fb8ueiISIYEvX3bBMzEfsD14la9xuOopm36Mk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The feature set to roll out in the U.S. this month will call 911 if you can’t]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happy 20th birthday, Y Combinator</title><link>https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1899092996702048709</link><author>btilly</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D Delivers Excellent Performance For Linux Developers, Creators &amp; Technical Computing</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-linux</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahead of tomorrow's availability of the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPUs in retail channels, today the embargo lifts on being able to deliver Ryzen 9 9950X3D reviews and performance benchmarks.

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker
- Python 3.10+The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft’s Muse AI Edits Video Games on the Fly</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-video-games</link><author>Matthew S.

This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

These digital documents serve as containers for everything from scientific research to government records, but their rigid formats often trap the data inside, making it difficult for machines to read and analyze."Part of the problem is that PDFs are a creature of a time when print layout was a big influence on publishing software, and PDFs are more of a 'print' product than a digital one," Derek Willis, a lecturer in Data and Computational Journalism at the University of Maryland, wrote in an email to Ars Technica. "The main issue is that many PDFs are simply pictures of information, which means you need Optical Character Recognition software to turn those pictures into data, especially when the original is old or includes handwriting."Computational journalism is a field where traditional reporting techniques merge with data analysis, coding, and algorithmic thinking to uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden in large datasets, which makes unlocking that data a particular interest for Willis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK Greenlights Amazon Kuiper, Starlink Faces New Rival</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/starlink-internet-kuiper-competition</link><author>Margo Anderson</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjYzMTg2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDc2MjA5Nn0.bmrElVf6-ehF4bT2-fpNTfzZKS4uhqwZHxx_YwvZ1bM/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Satellite broadband tech squares off, while also trying to avoid collisions]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of the Ethereum Blockchain with Andrew Koller</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/03/11/the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4255543830.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that was created by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in 2015.

On the other hand, GraphQL, a newer query language developed by Facebook, takes a more flexible and efficient approach, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request.In this article, we’ll break down REST and GraphQL, compare their differences, and help you decide which one is best suited for your use case. emerged in the early 2000s as a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.REST is not a protocol or standard but rather a set of guiding principles that leverage the existing  to enable communication between clients and servers.At its core, REST is built around . Each resource (such as a user, order, or product) is uniquely identified by a Uniform Resource Locator, and clients interact with these resources using a fixed set of HTTP methods. → Retrieve a resource (e.g.,  to fetch user data). → Create a new resource (e.g.,  to add a new user). → Update an existing resource (e.g.,  to update user details). → Remove a resource (e.g.,  to delete a user).For example, let’s say a client needs information about a specific user with .The client makes a requestThe server responds with a JSON representation of the userREST APIs typically  and use  to communicate the outcome of the request: → Resource successfully created → Client error (e.g., missing required fields) → Requested resource does not exist500 Internal Server Error → Unexpected server issueSimplicity and Intuitive Design: The resource-based model aligns well with most business domains, making REST intuitive for developers.: Each request contains all the information needed to complete it, making REST scalable across distributed systems.: HTTP's caching mechanisms can be leveraged to improve performance.REST APIs can be easily scaled using load balancers and CDNs.: With nearly two decades of widespread use, REST enjoys robust tooling, documentation, and developer familiarity.REST endpoints often return , leading to inefficient network usage. For example, if a mobile app only needs a user’s name and email, but the API response includes additional fields like address, phone number, and metadata, it results in .: If an API doesn’t return related data, the client may need to  to retrieve all required information. For example, to get user details and their posts, a client might have to make: (fetch user) (fetch user’s posts): When APIs evolve, maintaining backward compatibility becomes difficult. REST APIs often require  (, ), adding maintenance overhead.Rigid Response Structure: The server defines how data is returned, and clients must adapt to it—even if they only need a subset of the data.For years,  was the de facto standard for building APIs. However, as applications grew more complex, REST began to show limitations—especially in scenarios where clients needed fine-grained control over the data they fetched.To address these challenges, Facebook introduced GraphQL in 2015, offering a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval.Unlike REST, which organizes APIs around fixed endpoints and HTTP methods, GraphQL is a  that allows clients to request exactly the data they need—nothing more, nothing less.A  () replaces multiple REST endpoints, allowing clients to structure their own queries instead of relying on predefined responses.Here, the query asks for a specific user's firstName, email, profileUrl and posts, all within a GraphQL aggregates the data from multiple services and returns precisely the requested data.It solves the problems of  (getting unnecessary data) and  (requiring multiple requests to retrieve related data).Unlike REST, where API responses are  and may vary across versions, GraphQL enforces a strict schema that defines the shape of the data.A simple GraphQL schema for the above example might look like this:type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  profile: Profile!
  posts: [Post!]
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  url: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  publishedDate: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  posts: [Post!]!
}Three Core Functionalities of GraphQLGraphQL provides three core functionalities:Similar to GET requests in REST, GraphQL queries allow clients to request specific fields of data.Clients have full control over what they retrieve, avoiding unnecessary data fetching.Example: Fetching specific user and post details in a single requestquery {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}Equivalent to POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE in REST. Used to create, update, or delete resources in the API.Example: Creating a new postmutation {
  createPost(title: "GraphQL vs REST", content: "GraphQL solves many of REST's limitations...", publishedDate: "2025-03-10") {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}The response will contain the newly created post with its .3.  → Real-Time UpdatesUnlike REST, which requires polling or WebSockets for real-time updates, GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to listen for changes and receive updates automatically when data is modified.Ideal for chat applications, live feeds, stock market updates, and notifications.Example: Listening for new postssubscription {
  newPost {
    title
    content
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}Whenever a , all subscribed clients will .How GraphQL Differs from RESTBoth GraphQL and REST rely on HTTP requests and responses, but they differ in how they structure and deliver data.REST centers around resources (each identified by a URL).GraphQL centers around a schema that defines the types of data available.In REST, the  decides which data is included in a response. If a client requests a blog post, the API might also return related , even if they aren’t needed.With GraphQL, the  what to fetch. This makes GraphQL more flexible but also introduces challenges in caching and performance optimization.: Clients can request only the fields they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.Single Request for Multiple Resources: Related data can be retrieved in one request, solving REST’s  query problem.: GraphQL APIs use a schema to define available data, making them easier to explore and document.Real-time Data with Subscriptions: GraphQL natively supports real-time data updates through subscriptions, enabling clients to receive automatic notifications whenever data changes on the server.API Evolution Without Versioning: New fields can be added without breaking existing queries, avoiding REST-style ,  versioning issues.: Unlike REST, which can be used with basic HTTP clients (cURL, browsers), GraphQL requires a GraphQL server, schema, and resolvers.: REST APIs leverage HTTP caching (e.g., browser caching, CDNs), but GraphQL queries use POST requests, making caching trickier. Since clients can request arbitrary amounts of data, GraphQL APIs must be carefully optimized to prevent performance issues. Unoptimized queries (e.g., deeply nested requests) can lead to costly database scans, increasing the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.Performance Risks with GraphQLImagine a mobile app introduces a  that unexpectedly triggers a  on a critical database table.With REST, this scenario is less likely because API endpoints are predefined, and developers control how data is exposed.With GraphQL, the client , which could inadvertently request massive amounts of data. If a poorly designed query is executed on a high-traffic service, it could bring down the entire database.To mitigate this, GraphQL APIs require strict query rate limiting, depth restrictions, and cost analysis mechanisms—adding additional complexity to the implementation.There is no  answer.  remains a great choice for simple APIs, while  is powerful for complex applications with varying data needs.Ultimately, it’s not about which is better, but which is better for your specific needs.Your API is simple and doesn’t require flexible queries.You need caching benefits from HTTP. You need a standardized, well-established API  approach.You’re integrating with third-party services.Your team is already familiar with REST and need faster implementation.You need flexible and efficient data fetching.Your API serves multiple clients (mobile, web, IoT) with different data needs.Real-time updates are required (GraphQL subscriptions). You want to avoid API versioning issues.Your application requires deeply nested dataCan You Use Both REST and GraphQL?Absolutely! REST and GraphQL are , and many organizations implement a  to get the best of both worlds:GraphQL for client-facing applications where flexibility, performance, and dynamic querying are essential.REST for admin interfaces, third-party integrations, and internal microservices where statelessness, caching, and simplicity are beneficial.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

which was only released a few weeks ago!
Early adopters to integrate Kuzu-Wasm include Alibaba Graphscope, see: 1
and 2, and Kineviz, whose project will be launched soon.In this post, we’ll showcase the potential of Kuzu-Wasm by building a fully in-browser chatbot
that answers questions over LinkedIn data using an advanced retrieval technique: Graph
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG). This is achieved using Kuzu-Wasm
alongside WebLLM, a popular in-browser LLM inference engine that can
run LLMs inside the browser.A quick introduction to WebAssemblyWebAssembly (Wasm) has transformed browsers into general-purpose computing platforms.
Many fundamental software components, such as full-fledged databases, machine learning
libraries, data visualization tools, and encryption/decryption libraries, now have Wasm versions.
This enables developers to build advanced applications that run entirely in users’
browsers—without requiring backend servers. There are several benefits for building fully
in-browser applications:y: Users’ data never leaves their devices, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality.: An in-browser application that uses Wasm-based components
can run in any browser in a completely serverless manner.: Eliminating frontend-server communication can lead to a significantly faster and
more interactive user experience.With this in mind, let’s now demonstrate how to develop a relatively complex AI application completely in
the browser! We’ll build a  chatbot that uses graph retrieval- augmented
generation (Graph RAG) to answer natural language questions. We demonstrate this using
Kuzu-Wasm and WebLLM.The high-level architecture of the application looks as follows:
The term “Graph RAG” is used to refer to several techniques but in its simplest form the term
refers to a 3-step retrieval approach. The goal is to retrieve useful context from a graph DBMS (GDBMS)
to help an LLM answer natural language questions.
In our application, the additional data is information about
a user’s LinkedIn data consisting of their contacts, messages, companies the user or their contacts worked for. Yes, you can download
your own LinkedIn data (and you should, if
for nothing else, to see how much of your data they have!).
The schema of the graph database we use to model this data will be shown below momentarily. First, let’s go over the 3 steps of
Graph RAG:Q Q: A user asks a natural language question Q, such as “Which of my contacts work at Google?“.
Then, using an LLM, this question is converted to a Cypher query, e.g., MATCH (a:Company)<-[:WorksAt]-(b:Contact) WHERE a.name = "Google" RETURN b,
that aims to retrieve relevant data stored in the GDBMS to answer this question.Q Context: Q is executed in the GBMS and a set of records is retrieved, e.g., “Karen” and “Alice”. Let’s call these retrieved records “Context”.(Q + Context)  A: Finally, the original Q is given to the LLM along with the retrieved context and the LLM produces a natural language answer A,
e.g., “Karen and Alice work at Google.”The schema for our personal LinkedIn data’s graph is shown below:Upload CSV Files: Users drag and drop their LinkedIn CSV files, which are stored in Kuzu-Wasm’s virtual file system.Initial Processing: Using Kuzu’s  feature, the raw CSVs are converted into JavaScript objects.Normalization: In JavaScript, we clean and standardize the data by fixing timestamps, formatting dates, and resolving inconsistent URIs.Data Insertion: The cleaned data is inserted back into Kuzu-Wasm as a set of nodes and relationships.Our code follows the exact 3 steps above. Specifically, we prompt WebLLM twice, once to create a Cypher query Q,
which is sent to Kuzu-Wasm.
We adapted the prompts from our LangChain-Kuzu integration,
with a few modifications. Importantly, we make sure to include the schema information of the LinkedIn database from Kuzu in the prompt, which helps the LLM better understand
the structure and relationships (including the directionality of the relationships) in the dataset.In this example, we represented the schema as YAML instead of raw, stringified JSON in the LLM prompt.
In our anecdotal experience, for Text-to-Cypher tasks that require reasoning over the schema, we find that LLMs tend do better
with YAML syntax than they do with stringified JSON. More experiments on such Text-to-Cypher tasks will be shown in future blog posts.It’s indeed impressive to see such a graph-based pipeline with LLMs being done entirely in the browser! There are, however, some caveats.
Most importantly, in the browser, resources are restricted, which limits the sizes of different components of your application.
For example, the size of the LLM you can use is limited. We tested our implementation on a MacBook Pro 2023 and a Chrome browser.
We had to choose the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC model (see here for the model card),
which is an instruction-tuned model in MLC format. The  format is the smallest of the Llama 3.1 models that has 8B parameters
(the largest has 450B parameters, which is of course too large to run in the browser).
For simple queries, the model performed quite well. It correctly generated Cypher queries for the LinkedIn data, such as:How many companies did I follow?Which contacts work at Kùzu, Inc?However, we saw that for more complex queries requiring joins, filtering, and aggregation, the model struggled to return a valid Cypher query.
It often produced incorrect or incomplete Cypher queries for questions like: “Who endorsed me the most times?“.
Token generation is also far slower than what you may be used to in state-of-the art interfaces,
such as ChatGPT. In our experiments, we observed a speed of 15-20 tokens/sec, so generating answers took on average, around 10s.We have deployed this demo so you can test it in your browser:Live Demo: Drag and drop your LinkedIn data dump into
the app and start querying your personal graph. The demo also visualizes your data in a node-link graph view using GitHub Repository: The source code is openly available so you can experiment with it further. If you see better results with different models/prompts, we’d love to hear it!Once the data is loaded, you can see a visualization that looks something like this:The key takeaway from this post is that such advanced pipelines that utilize graph databases and LLMs are now possible .
We expect that many of the performance limitations of today will improve over time, with the wider adoption of WebGPU,
Wasm64, and other proposals
to improve Wasm. LLMs are also rapidly getting smaller & better, and before we know it, it will be possible to use very advanced LLMs
in the browser. The next release of Kuzu will include a native vector index (it’s already available
in our nightly build; see this PR for how to use it!).
As a result, you can also store the embeddings of documents
along with actual node and relationship records to enhance your graph retrievals, entirely within Kuzu.
Using our upcoming vector index,
you’ll be able to try all sorts of interesting RAG techniques, coupled with Kuzu-Wasm, all within the browser while keeping your data private.
The sky is the limit!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nancey Murphy - Arguing God from Moral Law?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBAxG6jxPU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kaBAxG6jxPU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like us on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.At the end, I will reflect on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug wasn’t fixed as of publishing this post, although it since has been); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison reproduced the 10% speedup “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from .Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a Raptor Lake i5-13500 I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds using my  configuration, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos. (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some  tuning flags which work around the regression.I’ve used  as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by /. You can find the complete output files and reports on github.Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.You’ll notice I didn’t benchmark the tail-call interpreter on the older Clang release (what would be ). The tail-call interpreter relies on new compiler features which only landed in Clang 19, meaning we can’t test it on earlier versions. This interaction, I think, is a big reason this story was so confusing, and why it took me so many benchmarks to be  I understood the situation.A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a  statement inside of a  loop, looking something like so:Most compilers will compile the  into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each  block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.It’s long been known that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a , each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.Modern C compilers support taking the address of labels, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the s in the latter code into a  LLVM instruction, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the -based interpreter!Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch  into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, in an old LLVM blog post introducing the new implementation.The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many  instructions can be quite expensive.In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented some limits on tail-duplication pass, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed -based implementation! This bug was first identified by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if you fix it, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the  of the regression.Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from 20% to 100%. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, more recent work finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single  statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):Notice that " is only 2% slower than , even though the base  build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.I haven’t mentioned the  benchmark, which you may notice claims to be  than " It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:Compiles the  into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotosCompiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic  graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, andIs able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatchThose facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the -based interpreter, and have the  do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” -based interpreter, goes ahead and duplicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the  test from earlier:Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the , but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.LLVM pull request 114990 merged shortly after I published this post, and fixes the regression. I was able to benchmark it before merge and confirm it restores the expected performance.For releases before that fix, the PR that caused the regression added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number.I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is  and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.Once you have metrics for  system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there  a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.On software engineering One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.And probably that  situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that  regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were  trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.Our compilers typically only  to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” -based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those  binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on the  attribute, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature.  does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the ; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) [[clang::musttailduplicate]] attribute on the interpreter  loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.I want to close with a call-out of how helpful  was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked  of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (, , , and ) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m  I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.Using , I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence  any given build in my  store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is shockingly concise; here’s a taste:I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required all of about 10 lines of code.That said, not everything was rosy. For one,  is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter. I’ve handled that one, but are there more?In addition, Nix is incredibly extensible and customizable, but figuring out how to make a specific customization can be a real uphill battle, and involve a lot of trial and error and source-diving. My patched LLVM build ended up being pretty short and clean, but getting there required me to read a lot of  source code, mixing and matching two under-documented extensibility mechanisms ( and  – not to be confused with , used elsewhere), and one failed attempt which successfully patched , but then silently built a new  against the unpatched version.Still,  was clearly enormously helpful here, and on net it definitely made this kind of multi-version exploration and debugging  saner than any other approach I can imagine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adafruit Successfully Automates Arduino Development Using &apos;Claude Code&apos; LLM</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/03/10/0054257/adafruit-successfully-automates-arduino-development-using-claude-code-llm?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:59:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adafruit Industries used large language model (LLM) tool Claude Code to streamline hardware development, writes managing director ptorrone. 

In a demo video Limor 'Ladyada' Fried compares the LLM's command-line interface to working with the build-automation tool CMake or "a weird cross between IRC and a BBS." The first step was converting a PDF of the hardware's datasheet into text, and Claude Code first displays the appropriate Bash command, while asking "Do you want to proceed?" ("What's nice is that it doesn't make changes, even though it has write access to files in the directory...") Eventually from the data sheet it creates things like an accurate register map, C++ headers, and even license text — and more. 

"We are using it to automate parts of the coding and debugging process for an Arduino-compatible Metro Mini board with an OPT 4048 color sensor," writes ptorrone:
Using Claude Code's shell access, we can compile, upload, and test code in a semi-automated workflow, allowing the LLM to suggest fixes for errors along the way... While the AI isn't perfect for high-level driver development, it's proving VERY useful for tedious debugging and super-fast iterative improvements, bringing hardware automation closer to ...reality. 
In the video Fried describes it like this. "I have a full debugging cycle, where I'm there — I'm like driving the car — but I have this copilot that's telling me where to go..." 

"I feel like I'm getting closer to having a semi-automated way of doing driver development."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Sphinx</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-sphinx</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67c99971fc5f88b98d88db92/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Ny2jz0WJhZWoGFy6wT3sHklkR2Hs2Bbxor5HoXtuSx4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Great Sphinx of Giza is probably the most recognisable statue in the world but it’s also one of the most mysterious...with conflicting stories about who built it and why have circulated since ancient times.

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Axiom Space and Red Hat Will Bring Edge Computing to the International Space Station</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/08/205225/axiom-space-and-red-hat-will-bring-edge-computing-to-the-international-space-station?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Axiom Space and Red Hat will collaborate to launch Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) to the International Space Station this spring. It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tom McLeish - Cosmology and Creation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwU_xc3VYZ4</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FwU_xc3VYZ4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Show your support for the show with a Closer To Truth merch purchase: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Volkswagen reintroducing physical controls for vital functions</title><link>https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-reintroducing-physical-controls-vital-functions</link><author>zfg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 07:25:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[All future Volkswagen models will feature physical controls for the most important functions, design chief Andreas Mindt has said.The German firm has been criticised over the past few years for moving many of the vital controls in its cars from physical buttons and dials to the infotainment touchscreen. Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI tools are spotting errors in research papers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00648-5</link><author>kgwgk</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:54:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friendly Feud: JS Party Edition (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/83</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/83/changelog--friends-83.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Our award-winning JS Party game show is back with a new name, a new channel, and the same ol’ survey-response-guessing fun!

Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (“that’s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff”) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague “there be dragons” feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I’ve learned that:ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there’s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It’s an escape code called OSC 52!)They aren’t completely standardized, and because of that they don’t always
work reliably. And because they’re also invisible, it’s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they  to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there’s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen ?
That’s an escape code! It’s called an “escape code” because the first character
is the “escape” character, which is usually written as , , ,
, or .Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes: which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don’t fit into Unicode. For example “left arrow key” is
, “Ctrl+left arrow” might be , and clicking the mouse might
be something like . which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.Now let’s talk about standards!The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
ECMA-48,
which was originally published in 1976.Define some general  for escape codes (like “CSI” codes, which are
 + something and “OSC” codes, which are  + something)Define some specific escape codes, like how “move the cursor to the left” is
, or “turn text red” is  . In the spec, the “cursor left”
one is called  and the one for changing colours is called
.The formats are extensible, so there’s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren’t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it’s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn’t define escape
codes for the mouse.There are a bunch of escape codes that aren’t defined in ECMA-48, for example:enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)I believe (correct me if I’m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in XTerm Control Sequences, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.This list of “what xterm supports” is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.To deal with this, there’s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called “terminfo”.It looks like the standard for terminfo is called X/Open Curses, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (“curses”) for accessing the database.For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
“clear screen” for all of the different terminals your system knows about:for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T "$term" 2>/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
On my system (and probably every system I’ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.should programs use terminfo?I think it’s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what’s in the  environment variable. Fish does this, for example.Identify a “single common set” of escape codes which works in “enough”
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (“don’t use terminfo”) include:[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.I’m not going to do it justice so I’m not going to summarize it, I think it’s
worth reading.I was just talking about the idea that you can use a “common set” of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it’s some combination of:The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren’t relevant on modern terminals)what’s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)What xterm supports (though I’d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)and maybe ultimately “identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those”, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to useI don’t think there are any resources like Can I use…? or
Baseline for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the “caniuse” for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)some reasons to use terminfoI also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:some people expect to be able to use the  environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with ), and there’s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo worldeven though there’s  variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there’s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you’re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I’m missingthere is no one standard for what the “single common set” of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren’t actually widely
supported enoughterminfo & user agent detectionThe way that ncurses uses the  environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.It also seems like it’s had some of the same results – the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being “xterm-256color” feels similar to how Safari’s user agent is
“Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15”. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn’t working well.On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don’t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though – I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.some more documents/standardsA few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:why I think this is interestingI sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is “outdated”, and since I
love the terminal so much I’m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less “outdated”.Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we’re still not there!). I don’t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it’s MUCH better, so maybe there’s hope.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CMU research shows compression alone may unlock AI puzzle-solving abilities</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/compression_illustration_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:22:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently discovered hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples.

myself reading a bunch of computer science papers. I don't pretend to be good
at this - but I don't mind some confusion or being overwhelmed, and I'm okay to
admit my ignorance. . I ran into this 15 year old paper 
that introduced several concepts entirely new to me. I struggled to understand
them.So what do you do then? You look for more papers to help explain things. This
is a risky endeavor, because they might confuse you even more, but it cannot be
avoided. I discovered a paper for a relevant data structure that mentioned
source code on a website. The source code was in C++ and I am working in Rust,
but I figured I'd take a look anyway. But when I went to the website the
resource wasn't there. So I mailed the owner of the website, who happened to be
a computer science professor.This professor (Gonzalo Navarro) was
very friendly and immediately mailed me back . Only during
our conversation did I realize I was seeing his name on a  of papers in
the field. Turned out I had stumbled into talking to one of the world experts in
the field of succinct data strucures, within a few days of my discovery they
even existed. Ignorance can bring you far.So what are succinct data structures? If you've taken computer science courses
in recent decades you might have, but I didn't run into them before as a
programmer, or if I did, I immediately forgot. But now I think they're data
structures with fascinating properties.We all use arrays, and hashmaps, and various trees are common too. We don't have to fully
understand how they work in order to be able to leverage their properties
effectively. Now I found msyelf wondering why people don't use these succinct
data structures more often.So I figured I'd talk a bit about them.To introduce succinct data structures it's useful to compare them to
compression. You use compression to shrink the size required to represent this
data. Compression can be useful to save disk space, or transmit less data over
the network, or to save memory. But to do anything useful with compressed data,
such as access it or query it, you first need to uncompress it again. Then
afterwards if you want to save space, you need to compress it again.Succinct data structures are different: they store their content in a compact
fashion like compression, but the compact form of the data has useful
properties. You can still use it!This is a field that seems to have emerged in computer science relatively
recently; many of the important data structures were invented in the last 25
years.In this article I going to give a tour of some of the succinct data structures
I have run into. I do not claim any expertise in this area at all - I only have
the vaguest notion of how many of these data structures work. Heck, I only
discovered they existed a few months ago! But as I said, you don't need to know
how they work in order to use them.In systems programming one cares more about the particular characteristics
(memory, performance) of data structures than usual. It strikes me there are
quite a few potential applications for them in this field. Much of the original
research work with compact data structures was done with C++. I myself like to
use Rust for my systems programming, so I looked for implementations in Rust.
I'm going to share what I found in the hopes other developers who use Rust find
them interesting. But the general overview is not limited to Rust in any way,
so if you're not interested in Rust I invite you to read on as well.Consider a vector (array) of bits. For instance What I'm going to say is pretty
obvious, but I think it's useful to highlight anyway. The bit vector above is 8
entries long. This means it fits into a single byte of memory.On a 64 bit computer, 64 bits fit in a single native integer. That's a bit
vector of 64 entries fitting inside 8 bytes, which is quite a lot if you
consider that a normal array takes that many bytes for a  integer
value. Even a bool in Rust takes a byte of storage.Bit vectors themselves aren't succinct data structures. In the end computer
memory is a giant array of bits. But succinct data structures try to make every
bit count.It's also important to note that a data structure might present itself as a bit
vector but actually stores the information inside in some special way that
makes certain operations fast. That's what we're going to see next.The rank/select bit vector is a core succinct data structure that many others
are built on. When I was hunting for source code I had only just realized that
these weren't just plain bit vectors but supported special operations, 
and .Let's look at our bit vector from before: .We give each entry an index (from 0 to 8, not inclusive).The  operation, given an index, counts how many bits have been set before
it in the array:So,  is 0 as no bits have been set at this position yet,  is
1,  is 1 as well (there's a 0 in that location, so no more bits have
been set).  is 2.  is 4.The  operation is the inverse of rank. You can give it a rank and get
the index where that bit was set.So  is 1,  is 3,  is 4, and  is 6.
Just the subsequent indexes where you see a .A succinct implementation of a rank/select bit vector can do these operations
in constant time. Only a little bit more data than is taken up by the bit
vector itself is required to support these operations.So what are the use cases for this? Let's consider a simple one.Let's say you have a big string that is actually composed of lots of little
strings. You want to track where all of these strings start. Now there are many
data structures you could use for this, and often they might be better, but
let's use a rank/select bit vector.Here's string with positions under it:Note the special  markers. These could be encoded as  in practice.So, this big string has 4 substrings, which we can view as an array:We can identify each substring with a number that is the index to this array:Now let's consider a rank/select bit vector. For the points in this string
where the substring starts, at each location you have an , you set a bit in
it.Now when you have any position in this you can efficiently determine which
sub-string it belongs to using  - you get a substring identifier. For
instance, position 12 is in "I am a string" and  gets me .If you add 1 to an identifier you get the next substring identifier - a useful
property.You can turn the substring identifier back into a position using . For
instance  gets you , the position of the first  in the string,
i.e the start of . Add 1 to that and you have the start of the
next substring. So if you want to find the end of a string, you can add 1 to
the substring identifier and do a select on that.This allows you to maintain unique identifiers for slices in a block of data in
a compact way.With a normal rank/select bit vector you'd use 1 bit times the length of the
string as overhead, plus a little. For a string a megabyte long, that's 128
kilobytes extra, and some change. But if the set bits are relatively uncommon
you can use a  rank/select bit vector to store this additional
information very efficiently, in far less space than would be required for the
original bit vector.In Rust I've really enjoyed working with
 which has both excellent
performance and very minimal overhead over the original bit vector. The author
is very responsive and is working a range of exciting new features.Another worthwhile library is . Of
particular interest is its implementation of , which is a sparse
implementation.  in my opinion however has a better design for efficient
construction of these data structures than  does. I'm therefore glad to
report that  is in the process of adding a sparse implementation as well.A  sounds like something out of science fiction. "Doc, the
wavelet matrix is out of sync! We cannot get back to 1985!". Related other
structures are , including the  which also
has a pretty cool scifi name.What these data structures do is generalize rank/select over "arbitrary
alphabets". The alphabet of a bit vector consists of 0 and 1, but many
real-world data has a bigger alphabet. Of particular interest in the succinct
data structure space is DNA, which has the alphabet of its nucleotides "G",
"C", "A" and "T", size 4. Another very common alphabet is text. If you use
UTF-8 and store its bytes its alphabet is of size 256. Generally the smaller the alphabet, the better: the data structures need less
space and can be faster.So let's consider the string "banana" in some text alphabet like ASCII.We can now rank and select particular symbols in the alphabet. Let's consider
the letter (symbol) : is 0, as there are no s yet at index 0. But 
gets you rank 3. Similarly  lets you find the index of a symbol in the
string:  gets you index 3, the index of the second .The implementation of a wavelet matrix uses rank/select bit vectors underneath.In Rust the  crate also has an
implementation of the wavelet matrix data structure.An FM-index is data structure that lets you store text (any vector of symbols)
in a compact way, but still allows important query operations. It doesn't use
much more space than the original text (or in some cases, less).The important queries here are: which counts how many occurrences of a certain pattern
(substring) exist in the stored text. which gives the index for each occurrence of the pattern in
the original textThe ability to load up a huge string of DNA data into memory and then being
able to find substrings in it fast is extremely useful in bioinformatics. But
any use where you have a lot text against which you want to support search
operations could potentially benefit from an FM-Index.In Rust the  crate provides this
functionality.Originally the  crate used the
 crate (by the same author) for its
underlying rank/select bit vector. But I've recently ported  over to
use  instead, which boosted the performance of  considerably.I've been working with the wonderful author of  to improve its API
and functionality, and a lot more is coming in this space, including support
for storing and searching large strings consisting of multiple substrings.Let's consider a tree of data, where each node can have arbitrary amounts of
children. These are very common structures in programming. Both XML and JSON
can be represented by trees like this; so can programming language ASTs.If you want to allow arbitrary navigation within the tree, you need the
following operations on nodes in the trees:: gives the node that this node is a child of: gives the first child node of a node: gives the next sibling of a node (within its parent): gives the previous sibling of a node (within its
parent)And often this is how these trees are represented in memory. Along these lines:This is quite a bit of information per node: on a 64 bit operating system this
node clocks in at 32 bytes, or 256 bits. A balanced parentheses tree allows the
same operations but takes only 2 bits per node! Well, there's a little overhead
too used by the rank/select bit vector underneath, and a bit more in a
management data structure, but it's still impressively tiny.How does it do this? In a very brief sketch, it basically encodes a tree as a
series of parentheses. Let's consider a single tree with a root node  and
two child node  and :This can be represented as "(()())".The outer parentheses encode the root node  and the two inner  pairs
encode its child nodes. Since we have only an opening parenthesis  and a
closing parenthesis , this information can be stored in a rank/select bit
vector, with 1 for open and 0 for close.And thanks to various clever operations using  and  and a bit
of supplementary information it can support all of the navigation I mentioned
above, and quite a few operations more.The amazing author of  is working on a Rust implementation on the
 branch of the  crate. I've been using it a lot in my own work
and it's looking great!
Building on these structuresYou can use these and other succinct data structures to build new functionality
with very interesting properties.I'm working on XML processing in Rust , and the paper I mentioned in
the beginning described a way to store XML data using succinct data structures.It use a balanced parenthesis tree to store the XML tree. This does not allow
one to attach information to nodes such as the XML tag information (i.e. the
 in  and ). But you can attach information to each node by
maintaining a sparse rank/select bit vector for each tag that marks the
relevant parenthesis with additional information.This rank/select bit vector then allows fundamental new operations: you can
"jump" to the first descendant node with a particular tag without having to
traverse the intervening nodes!XML also contains text nodes. These can be attached to the tree by tracking
which opening parenthesis have the text node tag. The paper also uses an
 to store the text nodes and allow fast queries over them.While XML is perhaps a rather quaint application for these techniques, imagine
a programming language that stores its AST in such a way. Huge ASTs could be
stored relatively compactly but still support interesting search operations,
which might open up new ways to implement programming language compilers.Now that I've discovered these data structures I'm left wondering where they
were in all my programming life. I suspect there's a lot of untapped potential
in them for general computing. While data structures that use a lot more memory
can generally do many of these operations more efficiently, the ability to use
less memory has performance implications all of its own. And until last
December I had no idea they even existed! I'm sure there are a lot of
developers out there that could find interesting uses for them.Update: if you're interested in succinct data structures I've created a small
Discord channel about them which you can join.The experiences I've had recently with professors, as well as the open
source developers in the Rust succinct space, give me some badly needed new
faith in humanity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mistral OCR</title><link>https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-ocr</link><author>littlemerman</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:39:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout history, advancements in information abstraction and retrieval have driven human progress. From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation. Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately 90% of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing Mistral OCR. Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite la Plateforme, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.State of the art understanding of complex documentsNatively multilingual and multimodalDoc-as-prompt, structured outputSelectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified informationState of the art understanding of complex documentsMistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures. Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook here. Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider  to switch between input and output. Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.Fuzzy Match in GenerationBeing lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.Doc-as-prompt, structured outputMistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents. See this example notebook. Available to self-host on a selective basisFor organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option. This ensures that sensitive or classified information remains secure within your own infrastructure, providing compliance with regulatory and security standards. If you would like to explore self-deployment with us, please let us know.We are empowering our beta customers to elevate their organizational knowledge by transforming their extensive document repositories into actions and solutions. Some of the key use cases where our technology is making a significant impact include:Digitizing scientific research: Leading research institutions have been experimenting with Mistral OCR to convert scientific papers and journals into AI-ready formats, making them accessible to downstream intelligence engines. This has facilitated measurably faster collaboration and accelerated scientific workflows.Preserving historical and cultural heritage: Organizations and nonprofits that are custodians of heritage have been using Mistral OCR to digitize historical documents and artifacts, ensuring their preservation and making them accessible to a broader audience.Streamlining customer service: Customer service departments are exploring Mistral OCR to transform documentation and manuals into indexed knowledge, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.Making literature across design, education, legal, etc. AI ready: Mistral OCR has also been helping companies convert technical literature, engineering drawings, lecture notes, presentations, regulatory filings and much more into indexed, answer-ready formats, unlocking intelligence and productivity across millions of documents.Mistral OCR capabilities are free to try on le Chat. To try the API, head over to la Plateforme. We’d love to get your feedback; expect the model to continue to get even better in the weeks to come. As part of our strategic engagement programs, we will also offer on-premises deployment on a selective basis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TikTok just released its React Native killer…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qjE8JkIVoQ</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-qjE8JkIVoQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:24:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using code FIRESHIP to get get 1-month free https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

That’s not new.

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

I greatly admire the way Colonel Vindman was willing to put everything on the line to defend the ideals of democracy and the American Dream.The American Dream is, at its core, the promise that hard work, fairness, and opportunity can lead to a better future. But in 2025, that promise feels like a question: How can we build on our dream so that it works for everyone?Alexander and I will explore this in our joint talk through the lens of democracy, community, and economic mobility. We come from very different backgrounds, but we strongly share the belief that everyone's American Dream is worth fighting for.Alexander Vindman has lived many lifetimes of standing up for what's right. He was born in the Soviet Union and immigrated to the U.S. as a child, growing up in Brooklyn before enlisting in the U.S. Army. Over the next 21 years, he served with distinction, earning a Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Iraq and eventually rising to Director of European Affairs for the National Security Council. When asked to choose between looking the other way or upholding the values he swore to protect, he chose correctly. That decision cost him his career but never his integrity. I have a lot to learn about what civic duty truly means from Alex.I build things on the Internet, like Stack Overflow and Discourse. I write on the internet, on this blog. I've spent years thinking about how people interact online, how communities work (or don't), and how we create digital spaces that encourage fairness, participation, and constructive discourse. Spaces that result in artifacts for the common good, like local parks, where everyone can enjoy them together. Whether you're running a country or running a forum, the same rules seem to apply: people need clear expectations, fair systems, strong boundaries, and a shared sense of purpose. This is the part of Stay Gold I couldn't tell you about, not yet, because I was working so hard to figure it out. How do you make long-term structural change that creates opportunity for everyone? It is an incredibly complex problem. But if we focus our efforts in a particular area, I believe we can change a lot of things in this country. Maybe not everything, but something foundational to the next part of our history as a country: how to move beyond individual generosity and toward systems that create security, dignity, and possibility for all.I can't promise easy answers, but what I can promise is an honest, unfiltered conversation about how we move forward, with specifics. Colonel Vindman brings the perspective of someone who embodied American ideals, and I bring the experience of building self-governing digital communities that scale, which turned out to be far more relevant to the future of democracy than I ever would have dreamed possible.Imagine what we can do if Alex and I work together.

      Michael Knyszek
      6 March 2025
      In last year’s blog post about the  package, we alluded
to some new features then in proposal review, and we’re excited to share that as
of Go 1.24 they are now available to all Go developers.
These new features are the 
function, which queues up a function to
run when an object is no longer reachable, and the 
type, which safely points to an object without
preventing it from being garbage collected.
Together, these two features are powerful enough to build your own 
package!
Let’s dig into what makes these features useful, and when to use them.Note: these new features are advanced features of the garbage collector.
If you’re not already familiar with basic garbage collection concepts, we
strongly recommend reading the introduction of our garbage collector
guide.If you’ve ever used a finalizer, then the concept of a cleanup will be
familiar.
A finalizer is a function, associated with an allocated object by calling
, that is later
called by the garbage collector some time after the object becomes unreachable.
At a high level, cleanups work the same way.Let’s consider an application that makes use of a memory-mapped file, and see
how cleanups can help.//go:build unix

type MemoryMappedFile struct {
    data []byte
}

func NewMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer f.Close()

    // Get the file's info; we need its size.
    fi, err := f.Stat()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Extract the file descriptor.
    conn, err := f.SyscallConn()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    var data []byte
    connErr := conn.Control(func(fd uintptr) {
        // Create a memory mapping backed by this file.
        data, err = syscall.Mmap(int(fd), 0, int(fi.Size()), syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED)
    })
    if connErr != nil {
        return nil, connErr
    }
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    mf := &MemoryMappedFile{data: data}
    cleanup := func(data []byte) {
        syscall.Munmap(data) // ignore error
    }
    runtime.AddCleanup(mf, cleanup, data)
    return mf, nil
}
A memory-mapped file has its contents mapped to memory, in this case, the
underlying data of a byte slice.
Thanks to operating-system magic, reads and writes to the byte slice directly
access the contents of the file.
With this code, we can pass around a , and when it’s
no longer referenced, the memory mapping we created will get cleaned up.Notice that  takes three arguments: the address of a
variable to attach the cleanup to, the cleanup function itself, and an argument
to the cleanup function.
A key difference between this function and  is that the
cleanup function takes a different argument than the object we’re attaching the
cleanup to.
This change fixes some problems with finalizers.It’s no secret that finalizers
are difficult to use correctly.
For example, objects to which finalizers are attached must not be involved
in any reference cycles (even a pointer to itself is too much!), otherwise the
object will never be reclaimed and the finalizer will never run, causing a
leak.
Finalizers also significantly delay reclamation of memory.
It takes at a minumum two full garbage collection cycles to reclaim the
memory for a finalized object: one to determine that it’s unreachable, and
another to determine that it’s still unreachable after the finalizer
executes.The problem is that finalizers resurrect the objects they’re attached
to.
The finalizer doesn’t run until the object is unreachable, at which point it is
considered “dead.”
But since the finalizer is called with a pointer to the object, the garbage
collector must prevent the reclamation of that object’s memory, and instead must
generate a new reference for the finalizer, making it reachable, or “live,” once
more.
That reference may even remain after the finalizer returns, for example if the
finalizer writes it to a global variable or sends it across a channel.
Object resurrection is problematic because it means the object, and everything
it points to, and everything those objects point to, and so on, is reachable,
even if it would otherwise have been collected as garbage.We solve both of these problems by not passing the original object to the
cleanup function.
First, the values the object refers to don’t need to be kept specially
reachable by the garbage collector, so the object can still be reclaimed even
if it’s involved in a cycle.
Second, since the object is not needed for the cleanup, its memory can be
reclaimed immediately.Returning to our memory-mapped file example, suppose we notice that our program
frequently maps the same files over and over, from different goroutines that are
unaware of each other.
This is fine from a memory perspective, since all these mappings will share
physical memory, but it results in lots of unnecessary system calls to map and
unmap the file.
This is especially bad if each goroutine reads only a small section of each
file.So, let’s deduplicate the mappings by filename.
(Let’s assume that our program only reads from the mappings, and the files
themselves are never modified or renamed once created.
Such assumptions are reasonable for system font files, for example.)We could maintain a map from filename to memory mapping, but then it becomes
unclear when it’s safe to remove entries from that map.
We could  use a cleanup, if it weren’t for the fact that the map entry
itself will keep the memory-mapped file object alive.Weak pointers solve this problem.
A weak pointer is a special kind of pointer that the garbage collector ignores
when deciding whether an object is reachable.
Go 1.24’s new weak pointer type,
, has a  method that
returns either a real pointer if the object is still reachable, or  if it
is not.If we instead maintain a map that only  points to the memory-mapped
file, we can clean up the map entry when nobody’s using it anymore!
Let’s see what this looks like.var cache sync.Map // map[string]weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]

func NewCachedMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    var newFile *MemoryMappedFile
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(filename)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newFile == nil {
                var err error
                newFile, err = NewMemoryMappedFile(filename)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newFile)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(filename, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newFile, func(filename string) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, wp)
                }, filename)
                return newFile, nil
            }
            // Someone got to installing the file before us.
            //
            // If it's still there when we check in a moment, we'll discard newFile
            // and it'll get cleaned up by garbage collector.
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, value)
    }
}
This example is a little complicated, but the gist is simple.
We start with a global concurrent map of all the mapped files we made.
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile consults this map for an existing mapped
file, and if that fails, creates and tries to insert a new mapped file.
This could of course fail as well since we’re racing with other insertions, so
we need to be careful about that too, and retry.
(This design has a flaw in that we might wastefully map the same file multiple
times in a race, and we’ll have to throw it away via the cleanup added by
.
This is probably not a big deal most of the time.
Fixing it is left as an exercise for the reader.)Let’s look at some useful properties of weak pointers and cleanups exploited by
this code.Firstly, notice that weak pointers are comparable.
Not only that, weak pointers have a stable and independent identity, which
remains even after the objects they point to are long gone.
This is why it is safe for the cleanup function to call ’s
, which compares the , and a crucial reason
this code works at all.Secondly, observe that we can add multiple independent cleanups to a single
 object.
This allows us to use cleanups in a composable way and use them to build
generic data structures.
In this particular example, it might be more efficient to combine
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile with  and
have them share a cleanup.
However, the advantage of the code we wrote above is that it can be rewritten
in a generic way!type Cache[K comparable, V any] struct {
    create func(K) (*V, error)
    m     sync.Map
}

func NewCache[K comparable, V any](create func(K) (*V, error)) *Cache[K, V] {
    return &Cache[K, V]{create: create}
}

func (c *Cache[K, V]) Get(key K) (*V, error) {
    var newValue *V
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(key)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newValue == nil {
                var err error
                newValue, err = c.create(key)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newValue)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(key, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newValue, func(key K) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(key, wp)
                }, key)
                return newValue, nil
            }
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[V]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(key, value)
    }
}
Despite our best efforts, cleanups and weak pointers can still be error-prone.
To guide those considering using finalizers, cleanups, and weak pointers, we
recently updated the guide to the garbage
collector with some advice
about using these features.
Take a look next time you reach for them, but also carefully consider whether
you need to use them at all.
These are advanced tools with subtle semantics and, as the guide says, most
Go code benefits from these features indirectly, not from using them directly.
Stick to the use-cases where these features shine, and you’ll be alright.For now, we’ll call out some of the issues that you are more likely to run into.First, the object the cleanup is attached to must be reachable from neither
the cleanup function (as a captured variable) nor the argument to the cleanup
function.
Both of these situations result in the cleanup never executing.
(In the special case of the cleanup argument being exactly the pointer passed
to ,  will panic, as a signal to the
caller that they should not use cleanups the same way as finalizers.)Second, when weak pointers are used as map keys, the weakly referenced object
must not be reachable from the corresponding map value, otherwise the object
will continue to remain live.
This may seem obvious when deep inside of a blog post about weak pointers, but
it’s an easy subtlety to miss.
This problem inspired the entire concept of an
ephemeron to resolve it, which is a
potential future direction.Thirdly, a common pattern with cleanups is that a wrapper object is needed, like
we see here with our  example.
In this particular case, you could imagine the garbage collector directly
tracking the mapped memory region and passing around the inner .
Such functionality is possible future work, and an API for it has been recently
proposed.Lastly, both weak pointers and cleanups are inherently non-deterministic, their
behavior depending intimately on the design and dynamics of the garbage
collector.
The documentation for cleanups even permits the garbage collector never to run
cleanups at all.
Effectively testing code that uses them can be tricky, but it is
possible.Weak pointers have been brought up as a feature for Go since nearly the
beginning, but for years were not prioritized by the Go team.
One reason for that is that they are subtle, and the design space of weak
pointers is a minefield of decisions that can make them even harder to use.
Another is that weak pointers are a niche tool, while simultaneously adding
complexity to the language.
We already had experience with how painful  could be to use.
But there are some useful programs that are not expressible without them, and
the  package and the reasons for its existence really emphasized that.With generics, the hindsight of finalizers, and insights from all the great work
since done by teams in other languages like C# and Java, the designs for weak
pointers and cleanups came together quickly.
The desire to use weak pointers with finalizers raised additional questions,
and so the design for  quickly came together as well.I want to thank everyone in the community who contributed feedback on the
proposal issues and filed bugs when the features became available.
I also want to thank David Chase for thoroughly thinking through weak
pointer semantics with me, and I want to thank him, Russ Cox, and Austin
Clements for their help with the design of .
I want to thank Carlos Amedee for his work on getting 
implemented, polished, landed for Go 1.24.
And finally I want to thank Carlos Amedee and Ian Lance Taylor for their work
replacing  with  throughout the
standard library for Go 1.25.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will the future of software development run on vibes?</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vibe_coding_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 23:41:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To many people, coding is about precision. It's about telling a computer what to do and having the computer perform those actions exactly, precisely, and repeatedly. With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, it's now possible for someone to describe a program in English and have the AI model translate it into working code without ever understanding how the code works. Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy recently gave this practice a name—"vibe coding"—and it's gaining traction in tech circles.The technique, enabled by large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, has attracted attention for potentially lowering the barrier to entry for software creation. But questions remain about whether the approach can reliably produce code suitable for real-world applications, even as tools like Cursor Composer, GitHub Copilot, and Replit Agent make the process increasingly accessible to non-programmers.Instead of being about control and precision, vibe coding is all about surrendering to the flow. On February 2, Karpathy introduced the term in a post on X, writing, "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." He described the process in deliberately casual terms: "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2284 - Ian Carroll</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJeRWPioGbQ</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jJeRWPioGbQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 18:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ian Carroll is an independent researcher, entrepreneur, and host of "The Ian Carroll Show" on YouTube.

The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD graphics and bonus features. This was announced back in 2022, and now, two and a half years later due to delays, we finally have Suikoden I&II HD Remaster--and I'm left wondering just how all that time this remaster spent cooking in the oven was spent.First, let's talk a bit about the games themselves. I first played both of these titles back on the PS1 many years ago. The original Suikoden was the game I was most excited to revisit, as it had been well over two decades since I'd last played it, and I'd forgotten so much about it. I was pleased to rediscover a pleasant, breezy RPG with a fast-paced story, smooth turn-based combat, and a charming sense of humor. It's quite short, and with the lack of load times and addition of battle speed-up options, you can easily finish it in around 15-20 hours doing all of the optional content.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Flying Taxi eVTOLs Might Not Fly Directly From A to B</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzooJ9SfkaA</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IzooJ9SfkaA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:00:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flying taxis have the potential to help passengers skip congestion by zipping across the skies from A to B.

It relies on protocols such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)  , Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)  , and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)  to establish direct connections across varied network environments. While its foundational mechanics are well-documented, practical implementation reveals subtleties in areas like NAT traversal, signaling, DataChannel management, and congestion control that can impact performance and reliability. This post examines core concepts and technical details for developers building WebRTC applications.Signaling and Initial Connection SetupWebRTC relies on an out-of-band signaling channel to coordinate the initial connection between peers, a mechanism not prescribed by the W3C WebRTC 1.0 specification but essential for exchanging Session Description Protocol (SDP) offers, answers, and ICE candidates, as outlined in  . SDP, a format for describing session parameters like codecs and transport options, is typically transmitted over a WebSocket connection to a centralized server in most deployments, the. This choice reflects WebSockets’ support for real-time, bidirectional communication, making them well-suited for the low-latency requirements of WebRTC signaling, but it can be any equivalent. The process begins with one peer generating an SDP offer via the CreateOffer() method, committing it locally with SetLocalDescription(), and sending it to the remote peer through the signaling connection. The receiving peer applies this offer as its remote description using SetRemoteDescription(), generates an answer with CreateAnswer(), sets it locally, and returns it. Once both peers have established their local and remote descriptions, they exchange ICE candidates—network endpoint details like IP addresses and ports—to finalize the connection.Peer A creates offer with CreateOffer()Peer A sets offer locally with SetLocalDescription()Peer A sends offer via the siganling connection to Peer BPeer B sets offer as remote with SetRemoteDescription(), sends answer backPeer A sets answer as remote with SetRemoteDescription()While WebSockets dominate due to their efficiency, alternatives like HTTP polling or REST APIs can serve simpler use cases, though their request-response model introduces measurable latency, often on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on network conditions. By contrast, Magic Wormhole provides a non-WebRTC example, using a rendezvous server to facilitate P2P setup with its own encrypted transport, distinct from WebRTC’s ICE-based approach. In practice, WebRTC applications favor WebSockets or similar protocols for their balance of practicality and performance.PeerConnection and DataChannel Multiplexing*The RTCPeerConnection object, as defined in  , manages WebRTC’s transport layer, overseeing ICE negotiation, DTLS encryption, and the SCTP association for DataChannels. A single PeerConnection can multiplex multiple streams, making it efficient to handle diverse communication types, een text messaging, file transfers, or telemetry—within one instance. Establishing additional PeerConnections incurs overhead: ICE negotiation takes 100-500 milliseconds depending on network conditions and candidate gathering, DTLS handshakes often require 50-200 milliseconds for key exchange, and SCTP setup adds further delay. Multiplexing DataChannels avoids these costs, centralizing transport management and reducing signaling complexity.DataChannels operate over a single SCTP association within a PeerConnection, identified by 16-bit stream IDs (0-65535) as specified in  . After the initial SDP negotiation establishes the SCTP association, new DataChannels can be created dynamically using CreateDataChannel() without additional offer/answer exchanges, a feature enabled by WebRTC’s design (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3 ). When one peer creates a DataChannel, the remote peer receives it via the OnDataChannel event, allowing immediate handler attachment. If both peers independently create DataChannels with the same label, WebRTC treats them as distinct unless explicitly coordinated with the negotiated: true option and a matching id, an option available for specific synchronization use cases. All DataChannels share SCTP’s congestion control, meaning high traffic on one channel—such as a multi-megabyte file transfer—can reduce throughput for others, a behavior governed by the SCTP congestion algorithms, occasionally necessitating data rate management.Using multiple PeerConnections is warranted only in specific cases: isolating traffic, routing through distinct TURN relays for redundancy, or separating streams for diagnostic clarity. Otherwise, a single PeerConnection is preferable. If all DataChannels close and no media tracks remain, the PeerConnection persists per the specification, but some implementations (e.g., older browsers) may terminate it after an idle timeout, typically 5-60 seconds, unless keep-alive traffic maintains activity. A low-bandwidth DataChannel sending periodic messages can mitigate this risk, ensuring the connection remains available for future use.ICE, NAT Traversal, and STUN/TURN MechanicsICE enables WebRTC to traverse Network Address Translators (NATs) by systematically evaluating network paths. It gathers candidates from local interfaces (host candidates), STUN servers (server-reflexive candidates), and TURN relays (relay candidates), testing them to establish connectivity. , formalized in  , sends candidates incrementally as they are discovered, allowing peers to begin connectivity checks immediately — typically reducing setup time by 50–200 milliseconds compared to Full ICE, which collects all candidates before SDP exchange. Most WebRTC implementations default to Trickle ICE for its efficiency nowadays.STUN servers, per  , query a peer’s public IP and port mapping behind a NAT, assuming the NAT permits some inbound traffic via techniques like UDP hole punching. This fails with Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), where ISPs assign multiple users a shared public IP and block inbound connections, rendering direct P2P infeasible. TURN servers, defined in  , address this by relaying all traffic: both peers establish outbound connections to the same TURN server, which proxies data between them. This process doubles bandwidth usage — for a 1Mbps stream, the TURN server handles 1Mbps inbound and 1Mbps outbound — making it resource-intensive and costly compared to STUN’s lightweight discovery role. TURN servers must be identical for both peers to form a relay path, whereas STUN servers can differ since they only provide mapping data, a distinction rooted in their respective protocol designs.Candidate exchange timing is important: candidates are gathered only  SetLocalDescription() commits the local SDP, ensuring ICE’s state machine progresses correctly. The remote peer processes candidates after SetRemoteDescription(), though some implementations (e.g., browsers like Chrome) buffer early candidates, while others (e.g.,  ) may discard them, leading to potential connectivity delays if not synchronized properly.Peer A sets local description, starts gathering candidatesPeer A sends candidate to Peer B when OnIceCandidate firesPeer B sets remote description, processes candidatePeer B sends its candidate back to Peer ABoth peers connect using received candidatesDataChannel Lifecycle and the OnOpen() ChallengeDataChannels introduce lifecycle considerations, notably with the OnOpen() event, which fires when the local system deems the SCTP stream usable (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3). This does not confirm remote readiness; the remote peer may not have attached an OnMessage handler, risking data loss if messages are sent immediately. In cases where data loss is a concern, consider a handshake after OnOpen() and before transmitting substantive data. This ensures both peers—and any external logic, like TCP-to-WebRTC bridges—are fully initialized, aligning with observed best practices in WebRTC deployments.Messages arriving before OnMessage is set are buffered by SCTP, but the buffer size varies by implementation—typically 256KB in browsers like Chrome and Firefox, configurable in libraries like Pion via MaxMessageSize. If this buffer overflows due to delayed handler attachment, older messages are dropped, necessitating prompt handler setup or application-level buffering for critical payloads. Post-connection, new DataChannels trigger OnDataChannel on the remote peer without signaling, leveraging the existing SCTP association. Closing all DataChannels leaves the PeerConnection intact, allowing later creation, though NAT timeouts (15-60 seconds per  ) or implementation-specific idle policies may necessitate keep-alive messages.Peer A and B complete initial connection setupPeer A creates DataChannel “chat” with CreateDataChannel()Peer A’s OnOpen fires, channel is ready locallyPeer B’s OnDataChannel fires, detects “chat”Peer B’s OnOpen fires, channel is readySCTP: Data Framing, Congestion, and ReliabilityDataChannels utilize SCTP over DTLS, offering reliable, message-oriented transport distinct from TCP’s stream model or UDP’s unreliability, per RFC 4960 and RFC 8832. SCTP preserves message boundaries, delivering complete payloads to OnMessage without reassembly. Browser implementations cap Send() at approximately 16MB (e.g., Chrome’s WebRTC internals), while SCTP’s default send/receive buffer is around 256KB, adjustable in libraries like Pion. Messages exceeding this buffer can block transmission, requiring manual chunking, e.g., into 64KB segments with sequence IDs, followed by reassembly on receipt, signaled by a final small packet.SCTP’s congestion control operates across all DataChannels in a PeerConnection, throttling sends based on network feedback like round-trip time and packet loss. Heavy traffic on one channel can degrade others, a shared constraint observable via the BufferedAmount() API. The OnBufferedAmountLow() event fires when the send buffer drops below a threshold (default 64KB in Pion), guiding pacing to avoid overflow, which can force channel closure in extreme cases. Unlike TCP, SCTP lacks guaranteed delivery if the PeerConnection fails mid-transfer; dropped messages require application-level acknowledgments, such as sequence number tracking, to ensure reliability for critical data.Maintaining Connection StabilityNetwork dynamics challenge WebRTC’s stability, particularly with NATs and firewalls. UDP NAT mappings expire after 15–60 seconds of inactivity (RFC 4787), necessitating keep-alive messages — e.g., a “ping” every 5–30 seconds via a DataChannel — to sustain bindings. TURN servers impose their own timeouts, often configurable (e.g., 10 minutes in Coturn), requiring periodic traffic to maintain relay sessions. Network changes, such as switching from Wi-Fi to cellular, may disrupt connectivity, addressable by an ICE restart — renegotiating SDP to update candidates per RFC 8835. Logging PeerConnectionState transitions (“connected” to “disconnected” to “failed”) identifies these disruptions, enabling recovery actions like re-establishing the connection or switching to TURN.Peer A sends STUN candidate, no responsePeer B can’t connect via STUN (e.g., CGNAT)Peer A switches to TURN server candidatePeer B uses same TURN server candidateConnection works through TURN relay Debugging and Optimization StrategiesDebugging hinges on comprehensive logging. Monitoring PeerConnectionState tracks connection lifecycle events, while OnIceCandidate verifies candidate exchange—missing candidates often signal NAT traversal failures resolvable with TURN or refined STUN configurations. The OnBufferedAmountLow() callback detects congestion when BufferedAmount() exceeds typical thresholds (e.g., 256KB), indicating a slow receiver. Optimization includes reducing ICE setup time by limiting STUN queries (e.g., one server per region) or prioritizing host candidates, though this risks connectivity if NAT traversal fails. For TURN, short-lived credentials (e.g., 24-hour expiry) and bandwidth caps control costs, while tuning SCTP’s MaxMessageSize (default 256KB in Pion) supports high-throughput use cases, balancing performance with reliability.PeerConnectionState changes to “connecting”OnIceCandidate shows new candidatePeerConnectionState changes to “connected”OnDataChannel detects new channelOnBufferedAmountLow shows buffer statusWebRTC provides a robust framework for P2P communication, requiring however signaling over e.g. WebSockets. Applications need to be designed with considerations for multiplexing DataChannels, managing ICE and NAT traversal, handling SCTP congestion, and ensuring connection stability each require deliberate attention. Keep in mind that WebRTC is primarily used for real-time peer-to-peer communication in applications like video conferencing, voice calls, live streaming, and data sharing, but it is not suitable for broadcasting, persistent background tasks, or bulk data transfers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI revolution is here.

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

Virtual machines often run inside hosting environments to prevent one customer from being able to access or control the resources of other customers. By breaking out of one customer’s isolated VM environment, a threat actor could take control of the hypervisor that apportions each VM. From there, the attacker could access the VMs of multiple customers, who often use these carefully controlled environments to host their internal networks.“If you can escape to the hypervisor you can access every system,” security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Mastodon. “If you can escape to the hypervisor, all bets are off as a boundary is broken.” He added: “With this vuln you’d be able to use it to traverse VMware managed hosting providers, private clouds orgs have built on prem etc.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CNCF Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8bb_SkDxQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bY8bb_SkDxQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 19:55:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell about it.With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act. Though Hazelight has yet to release anything less than great, it was almost shocking to see how much it had learned from--and improved upon--2021's critical darling It Takes Two. Levels and environments are vast, gorgeous, and varied; our two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are full of depth, charm, and personality; the game's seemingly endless gimmicks and gameplay mechanics, all of which are introduced at far more rapid pace than It Takes Two, are nearly all so fun, brilliant, and tightly designed that they could stand alone; and its writing, plot beats, and overall structure deliver a remarkable story that rappels from heart wrenching, commentative, darkly humorous, and brimming with joy just as fluidly as our heroines grapple-hook between buildings. Though there is a level of cheesiness that coats the game's overarching story and its primary antagonist, Rader, as a whole Split Fiction is a marvelous game that sets a new benchmark not only for Hazelight, but for co-op experiences as a whole.Despite its inevitable greatness, Split Fiction kicks off with a humble (if slightly cliched) beginning in which it introduces its protagonists: Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster. Mio and Zoe are nothing alike. Whereas Mio is an angsty, city-slicking, sci-fi enthusiast who'd sooner yank out her own tooth than open up to a stranger, the fantasy-loving Zoe is sunshine incarnate. And yet, the pair does share one thing in common: They are both unpublished writers in dire need of money and a byline.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Hilton, Marriott and Others Are Using Timeshares to Make Billions | WSJ The Economics Of</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncGLBfG-0Vc</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ncGLBfG-0Vc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 15:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. timeshare industry has consolidated behind a few major brands: Hilton Grand Vacations, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Travel + Leisure. The industry has evolved significantly from its notoriously scammy origins, having much higher standards and using more flexible points-based systems.

Users in distant regions experience significant latency, slow load times, and frustrating buffering issues. The farther they are from your server, the longer it takes for data to travel across the network, degrading their experience.To fix this, you need a way to bring your content physically closer to your users, reducing the distance data must travel.This is exactly what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) does.In this article, we will explore what a CDN is, how it works, its benefits, different use-cases, and popular CDN providers.A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver  (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their .The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to end-users with  and  by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects the request to the nearest server in its network,  and A  operates using three key components: – The primary servers where the original content is stored. – Directs user requests to the nearest edge server instead of the origin server.By leveraging edge servers distributed across multiple geographical regions, CDNs minimize latency and accelerate content delivery. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a CDN works: – A user visits a website and requests content, such as an image, a webpage, or a video. This request must be  that can serve the content. – The browser  to resolve the web content address (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/images/logo.png) into an IP address. The DNS return the nearest CDN edge server’s IP address rather than the origin server.If the content is  at the edge server, it is served immediately to the user.If not, the edge server forwards the request to the origin server. The origin server processes the request and  to the edge server. The edge server caches the content it retrieved from the origin server. – Once cached, future requests for the same content are served directly from the edge server, reducing load on the origin and improving speed.CDNs use a Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism to determine how long content remains cached before expiring. To ensure users always receive the latest version, CDNs periodically refresh and update cached content from the origin server. – By serving content from the nearest edge server, CDNs reduce latency and improve page load speed. – CDNs offload traffic from the origin server by caching static assets, reducing resource consumption.Improved Availability and Reliability – With multiple servers in different locations, CDNs prevent single points of failure.: CDNs can handle traffic spikes more efficiently than traditional hosting, making them ideal for websites with fluctuating traffic patterns.: CDNs make it easier to deliver content to users worldwide, regardless of their location. – Many CDNs offer DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and bot mitigation to secure applications.While CDNs offer many benefits, it’s important to note that they also introduce some challenges like: Integrating a CDN requires proper DNS configuration, cache rules, and content invalidation policies.Many CDN providers charge based on bandwidth usage and request volume. For high-traffic websites, CDN costs , especially for video streaming, gaming, and software distribution.Accelerating Website PerformanceWebsites with  use CDNs to ensure  for users regardless of location. (images, CSS, JavaScript) at , reducing the time required to fetch them from the origin.Video Streaming & OTT PlatformsCDNs optimize video content delivery by caching video files closer to users, minimizing buffering and latency.Supports adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) to serve video based on the user’s internet speed.Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use CDNs to serve videos and music in real-time to user.Multiplayer  require  content delivery to ensure a smooth gaming experience.CDNs help distribute game updates, patches, and downloadable content (DLCs) faster.Content & Media DistributionNews websites and content platforms deliver images, articles, and videos through a CDN to handle large traffic spikes.Software Distribution & UpdatesOperating system and software vendors use CDNs to distribute large files, updates, and patches quickly.Accelerates the distribution of software updates and applications to users worldwide. Microsoft, Apple, and Google use CDNs for distributing Windows updates, macOS updates, and Android app downloads.Here are some of the most widely used CDN providers:: One of the oldest and largest CDN providers, known for its extensive global network and robust security features.: Offers a comprehensive suite of performance and security services, including a free tier for smaller websites.: Known for its real-time content delivery and edge computing capabilities.: Integrated with AWS, provides seamless scalability and extensive integration with other AWS services.: Leverages Google’s global network infrastructure to ensure high performance and low-latency content delivery. – Designed for applications hosted on Microsoft Azure, providing seamless integration with other Azure services.Selecting the best CDN depends on your , , and platform integration requirements. Cloudflare and Fastly are great for performance and security, while CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, and Azure CDN offer seamless cloud integration. Akamai is a preferred choice for high-scale enterprise applications requiring a robust global network.A Content Delivery Network is an essential tool for any online service aiming to deliver content quickly and reliably to a global audience.By understanding how CDNs work, the benefits they offer, and how to choose and implement the right one, you can significantly enhance the performance, security, and scalability of your web applications.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I
work for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes & etcd & CSI
(Container Storage Interface)
because of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes & etcd
(and also CSI) since 2020. Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a
Specialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the
Kubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project
needed help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that
"you come for the technology, and stay for the people": for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a
wonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward. Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring
a stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with SIG
Instrumentation, where I
created and led the Kubernetes Structured Logging effort.
I'm still the main project lead for Kubernetes Metrics Server,
providing crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,
right around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most
scalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's
history. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing. Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd
maintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
and GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and
etcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my
job, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more
importantly, the awesome open source community.Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is
a very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,
serving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and
reliability issues. Creating a dedicated SIG
allowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,
and ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just
described being addressed, and to what extent?: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and
transparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs
(Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals
and PRRs (Production Readiness Reviews,
which has improved our feature development and release cycle.Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from
becoming a SIG?: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like
Prow and TestGrid. For large projects like
etcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear
tools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also
help etcd.: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation
for addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes
ecosystem.The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like
to highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd
contributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had
greater collaboration with other SIGs like SIG API
Machinery,
SIG Scalability,
SIG Testing,
SIG Cluster Lifecycle, etc.This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes
ecosystem. The formation of the etcd Operator Working Group
under the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful
collaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within
Kubernetes.Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and
community involvement in recent months?: Yes -- as showing in our
unique PR author data
we recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current
priorities for SIG etcd?: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also
working on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making
etcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of
course, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure
not only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve
the understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points
that the community cares about the most.Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're
constantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,
so we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG
Scalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the
evolving cloud native landscape?: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The
cloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how
can they get involved?: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our
SIG etcd meetings,
follow discussions on the etcd-dev mailing list, and check
out our GitHub issues. We're always looking for people to
review proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing
to SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase. Start with issues labeled "good first
issue" or "help wanted" to find tasks that are suitable for newcomers.: Contribute to the development of new features and enhancements. Check the
etcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in.: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code
changes, and providing feedback.: Improve etcd's documentation by adding new content,
clarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is
essential for users and contributors.: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or Slack channels.
Helping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution.: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack,
attending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will
help you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the
people involved.: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider
finding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned!
Our first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will
have a new round of mentorship program coming up.: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even
fixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix
can be a great way to get involved.By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a
critical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable
experience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing!Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that
you'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs?: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established
processes of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other
SIGs, and focus on building a strong community.: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS
journey:: Open source development can take time. Don't get
discouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if
you encounter challenges.: The etcd community values collaboration and
respect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve
common goals.: Contributing to open source should be
enjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that
you find fulfilling.Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!For more information and resources, please take a look at :]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to install KSH on FreeBSD</title><link>https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-ksh-kornshell-on-freebsd/</link><author>Vivek Gite</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 23:50:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cyberciti.biz/atom/">Dev - NixCraft</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[nstalling KSH (KornShell) on FreeBSD can be done with either FreeBSD ports or the pkg command. The ports collection will download the KSH source code, compile it, and install it on the system. The pkg method is easier, and it will download a pre-compiled binary package. Hence, it is recommended for all users. KornShell (KSH) has a long history, and many older Unix systems and scripts rely on it. As a result, KSH remains relevant for maintaining and supporting legacy infrastructure. Large enterprises, especially those with established Unix-based systems, continue to use KSH for scripting and system administration tasks. Some industries where KSH is still commonly used include finance and telecommunications. While Bash has become the dominant shell in many Linux distributions, KSH still holds a significant presence in Unix-like environments, particularly in legacy systems. Therefore, installing KSH and practicing with it is worthwhile if you plan to work in such environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers surprised to find less-educated areas adopting AI writing tools faster</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/virtual_typewriter_hero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 22:32:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, experts have debated how widely AI language models would impact the world.

But also being developed is a compiler named trapc "intended to be implemented as a cybersecurity compiler for C and C++ code, said developer Robin Rowe..."

 Due by the end of this year, trapc will be a free, open source compiler similar to Clang... Rowe said. TrapC has pointers that are memory-safe, addressing the memory safety issue with the two languages. With TrapC, developers write in C or C++ and compile in TrapC, for memory safety... 
Rowe presented TrapC at an ISO C meeting this week. Developers can download a TrapC whitepaper and offer Rowe feedback. According to the whitepaper, TrapC's memory management is automatic and cannot leak memory. Pointers are lifetime-managed, not garbage-collected. Also, TrapC reuses a few code safety features from C++, notably member functions, constructors, destructors, and the new keyword. 

"TrapC Memory Safe Pointers will not buffer overrun and will not segfault," Rowe told the ISO C Committee standards body meeting, according to the Register. "When C code is compiled using a TrapC compiler, all pointers become Memory Safe Pointers and are checked."
 
In short, TrapC "is a programming language forked from C, with changes to make it LangSec and Memory Safe," according to that white paper. "To accomplish that, TrapC seeks to eliminate all Undefined Behavior in the C programming language..." 

"The startup TRASEC and the non-profit Fountain Abode have a TrapC compiler in development, called trapc," the whitepaper adds, and their mission is "to enable recompiling legacy C code into executables that are safe by design and secure by default, without needing much code refactoring... The TRASEC trapc cybersecurity compiler with AI code reasoning is expected to release as free open source software sometime in 2025." 

In November the Register offered some background on the origins of TrapC...

What's Linux's marketshare on Steam? The Steam Survey numbers tell this story: 

11/24: 2.03%
12/24: 2.29%
01/25: 2.06%
02:25: 1.45% 

"The February numbers show a staggering 0.61% drop to Linux use..." reports Phoronix. But they attribute this to an sampling error:
According to the survey, it shows 50% of Steam users using the Simplified Chinese language pack [a 20% increase from the month before]. In prior months where there has been drops to Linux use, it's been correlated to wild swings in the Chinese use on Steam. This looks to be another such month. 
Of the Linux specific data, SteamOS continues to prove most popular for that Valve distribution powering the Steam Deck [at 34.67%, with Arch Linux coming in second at 9.7%]. 
AMD CPUs power around 70% of the Linux gaming systems thanks to the Steam Deck APU and AMD Ryzen being quite popular with Linux enthusiasts.

Though the package has been removed from PyPI, researchers at security platform Socket.dev say it enabled "coordinated, unauthorized music downloads from Deezer — a popular streaming service founded in France in 2007."

Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezer's access restrictions... The package is designed to log into Deezer, harvest track metadata, request full-length streaming URLs, and download complete audio files in clear violation of Deezer's API terms... [I]t orchestrates a distributed piracy operation by leveraging both user-supplied and hardcoded Deezer credentials to create sessions with Deezer's API. This approach enables full access to track metadata and the decryption tokens required to generate full-length track URLs. 

Additionally, the package routinely communicates with a remote server... to update download statuses and submit metadata, thereby centralizing control and allowing the threat actor to monitor and coordinate the distributed downloading operation. In doing so, automslc exposes critical track details — including Deezer IDs, International Standard Recording Codes, track titles, and internal tokens like MD5_ORIGIN (a hash used in generating decryption URLs) — which, when collected en masse, can be used to reassemble full track URLs and facilitate unauthorized downloads... 

Even if a user pays for access to the service, the content is licensed, not owned. The automslc package circumvents licensing restrictions by enabling downloads and potential redistribution, which is outside the bounds of fair use...

This is achieved through public key addressing and a multi-layered encryption and routing process that ensures no single node in the Tor network has complete knowledge of the communication path. Unlike traditional network addressing, where a domain name resolves to an IP address via DNS, hidden services derive self-authenticating .onion addresses from cryptographic public keys. This eliminates the need for a centralized registry, instead relying on a fully distributed lookup mechanism via a subset of Tor relays known as Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs).In this post, we explore how enables decentralized, anonymous routing and service discovery while mitigating surveillance and censorship.Addressing, Public Key Infrastructure, and Cryptographic IdentityEach hidden service is uniquely identified by its .onion address, which is directly derived from an Ed25519 public key. The service generates a key pair, where the private key remains confidential and is used to sign service descriptors, while the public key forms the basis of the address. The address itself is constructed by computing the Blake2b cryptographic hash of the public key, appending a checksum, encoding the result using Base32, and appending the .onion suffix. This deterministic derivation ensures that the .onion address is self-authenticating—clients can verify they are communicating with the correct service without relying on a trusted third party.# 1.

Construct Onion Addressonion_address_raw = public_key || checksum || 0x03onion_address = Base32(onion_address_raw) + ".onion"This cryptographic model ensures that only the entity possessing the corresponding private key can operate a given .onion address. It also means that services cannot arbitrarily select easy-to-remember addresses; instead, addresses are pseudo-random, unless techniques such as brute-force key generation (vanity address generation) are used.Hidden Service Descriptor and the Decentralized Lookup MechanismBecause .onion addresses do not resolve via DNS, Tor employs a decentralized lookup mechanism using Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs). The hidden service generates a , a structured document containing:Ed25519 Public Key: af3d2e4c5b6a7890c123d456e...Introduction Points: [node1, node2, node3]Signature: Signed(service_descriptor, private_key)Encrypted Metadata: Session keys, authentication infoThese descriptors are deterministically mapped to HSDir nodes based on a hash of the service’s public key. HSDirs store descriptors temporarily, typically expiring within an hour, requiring hidden services to refresh them periodically to maintain reachability. A client looking to access a service calculates the appropriate HSDirs by hashing the .onion address and querying the network for the latest descriptor. Blake2b(public_key) -> hsdir_index.The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Service Descriptor StorageTor’s hidden service discovery mechanism operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) model, where descriptors are stored across a subset of nodes designated as HSDirs. The allocation of storage responsibilities is determined by a deterministic hash function, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. As time progresses, descriptor responsibility shifts dynamically among different relays. The ephemeral nature of descriptors and their encrypted structure makes large-scale enumeration of hidden services infeasible.When a client queries an HSDir for a descriptor, the request itself is onion-routed, ensuring that the HSDir does not learn the client’s IP address. To mitigate exploitation, Tor employs proof-of-work mechanisms and rate-limiting to prevent large-scale descriptor harvesting.Entry Guards and Circuit EstablishmentWhen a client or a hidden service establishes a connection to the Tor network, the first relay in its circuit is known as an entry guard. This relay is selected for its long-term stability and performance characteristics. Entry guards mitigate certain traffic correlation attacks by limiting exposure to malicious relays, as a client does not randomly select a new first-hop node for every connection.For clients, entry guards prevent frequent exposure to new first-hop nodes, which mitigates attacks where adversaries could rotate relays to observe multiple connections and correlate user activity.For hidden services, entry guards ensure a consistent first-hop into the Tor network. A hidden service forms circuits through introduction points and rendezvous points, but its entry guard remains stable over time, preventing attackers from easily mapping its presence.Since entry guards know the client’s real IP (or the hidden service’s real IP in a single-hop mode), their security and integrity are critical. However, because they do not know the final destination or whether the connection belongs to a hidden service, they cannot deanonymize users in a standard multi-hop configuration.Establishing a Connection: Introduction Points and Rendezvous PointsOnce the client retrieves the service descriptor, it selects an introduction point from the list contained in the descriptor. Introduction points are Tor relays preselected by the hidden service, maintaining persistent circuits to the service, enabling communication without exposing its actual network location.The client encrypts an introduction request using the service’s public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This request is relayed through the Tor network to the introduction point, which forwards it through its pre-established circuit to the hidden service. The service then responds by establishing a connection to a , a random Tor relay chosen by the client. Once both the client and the service connect to this relay, a bidirectional communication channel is established over separate Tor circuits, ensuring that no single entity in the network has knowledge of both endpoints.Proof-of-Work Defense Mechanism for Hidden ServicesTor’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) defense mechanism , introduced with the release of Tor 0.4.8 in August 2023, requires clients to solve computational puzzles before accessing onion services, aiming to deter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. When an onion service detects stress, it embeds PoW parameters in its service descriptor, specifying a cryptographic challenge. The client fetches this descriptor, extracts parameters, and computes a solution using the Equi-X PoW scheme, which involves a memory-hard computational puzzle requiring RAM for efficient solving. The challenge consists of concatenated values, including a service-specific seed and nonce, hashed using the HashX function. Clients iteratively attempt solutions until they find one that meets the difficulty requirement (based on leading zero bits in a Blake2b-derived hash). The solved puzzle, nonce, and effort value are then submitted in an INTRODUCE1 message. The service verifies the solution by quickly checking its hash and the Equi-X proof, then places the request in a priority queue based on effort. Clients investing more computational work receive higher priority in the queue, ensuring that motivated users bypass attackers attempting to flood introduction requests. Dynamic difficulty tuning ensures adaptive effort adjustments based on observed attack severity, keeping the service available while discouraging large-scale automated abuse.Routing, Onion Encryption, and Traffic FlowTor’s circuit-based routing model ensures that no single node in the network possesses a complete view of a communication path. Onion encryption encapsulates messages in multiple layers, where each relay decrypts only its layer, revealing the next hop without exposing the full route.Decrypts a single encryption layer to determine the next relayForwards the partially decrypted packet without knowledge of its ultimate destinationAdds an additional layer of encryption when transmitting responses back to the clientBy the time traffic reaches the rendezvous point, both the client and the hidden service are communicating through independent Tor circuits, preventing correlation of the origin and destination.Non-Anonymous Single-Hop Hidden ServicesTor supports an alternative mode for hidden services that prioritizes performance over anonymity. By enabling HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1 and HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1, a hidden service bypasses the traditional three-hop circuit model and instead directly registers with HSDirs while accepting connections through a single-hop Tor circuit.While this significantly reduces latency, it exposes the service’s real IP address to its entry guard relay, making it traceable. This configuration is primarily used for services requiring censorship resistance but not anonymity, such as certain high-performance Tor-based applications or relays used for onion-routed content distribution.Service Availability and Scalability ConsiderationsReliability of hidden services is affected by factors including descriptor refresh rates, introduction point stability, and HSDir churn. A hidden service can improve availability by increasing the number of introduction points, ensuring resilience against relay failures. However, since the descriptor itself is the bottleneck for discovery, additional introduction points do not necessarily accelerate lookup speed. Services must ensure they remain online consistently to prevent descriptor expiration, as clients will otherwise be unable to retrieve valid routing information.To mitigate excessive load, Tor imposes limits on the number of introduction points per service. High-traffic services often deploy load-balancing mechanisms by distributing traffic across multiple onion addresses, each backed by different backend nodes. This approach prevents bottlenecks in descriptor resolution and introduction request handling.Security and Resistance to EnumerationTor’s architectural design makes hidden services resistant to large-scale enumeration and targeted de-anonymization attacks. The use of DHT-based lookup combined with ephemeral descriptors, encryption, and circuit-layer separation ensures that no single entity in the network can trivially index all hidden services. Additionally:HSDir nodes can only observe encrypted descriptors, not .onion addresses directlyIntroduction points never learn the client’s IP addressRendezvous points see only anonymized Tor circuits, preventing correlationThe self-authenticating nature of .onion addresses ensures that man-in-the-middle attacks are infeasible. Even if an attacker compromises an HSDir node, they cannot alter or forge descriptors without detection due to cryptographic signing.Decentralized Communication with Tor Hidden ServicesTor hidden services provide a censorship-resistant, decentralized alternative to traditional domain-based addressing. Unlike conventional services that rely on DNS and public IP exposure, .onion addresses are self-authenticating and do not require a central registry, making them resilient against domain seizures and network filtering.A key advantage of hidden services is their ability to function within NAT-restricted environments and firewalled networks. Unlike traditional services that rely on port forwarding, hidden services establish outbound-only Tor circuits, allowing them to function seamlessly behind NAT, carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT), and firewalls without requiring manually opened inbound ports. The service initiates outgoing circuits to introduction points, meaning that as long as the service has an outbound connection, it remains accessible — even in networks that typically block unsolicited inbound connections. This makes .onion services ideal for hosting within home networks, mobile carriers, and restricted corporate environments where traditional hosting would be infeasible without port forwarding or VPN tunneling.Multi-hop circuits remain the foundation of anonymous hidden services, while single-hop configurations offer a higher performance alternative at the cost of privacy. Despite this trade-off, .onion addressing continues to provide decentralized resolution, censorship resistance, and NAT-friendly deployment, making it viable for both anonymity-preserving and infrastructure-agnostic use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>27-Year-Old EXE Became Python In Minutes.

They'd spotted a Reddit post "detailing how someone took a 27-year-old visual basic EXE file, fed it to Claude 3.7, and watched as it reverse-engineered the program and rewrote it in Python."

It was an old Visual Basic 4 program they had written in 1997. Running a VB4 exe in 2024 can be a real yak-shaving compatibility nightmare, chasing down outdated DLLs and messy workarounds. So! OP decided to upload the exe to Claude 3.7 with this request: 
"Can you tell me how to get this file running? It'd be nice to convert it to Python."> 
Claude 3.7 analyzed the binary, extracted the VB 'tokens' (VB is not a fully-machine-code-compiled language which makes this task a lot easier than something from C/C++), identified UI elements, and even extracted sound files. Then, it generated a complete Python equivalent using Pygame. According to the author, the code worked on the first try and the entire process took less than five minutes... 
Torrone speculates on what this might mean. "Old business applications and games could be modernized without needing the original source code... Tools like Claude might make decompilation and software archaeology a lot easier: proprietary binaries from dead platforms could get a new life in open-source too." 

And maybe Archive.org could even add an LLM "to do this on the fly!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Perl&apos;s CPAN Security Group is Now a CNA, Can Assign CVEs</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/01/0548217/perls-cpan-security-group-is-now-a-cna-can-assign-cves?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Active since 1995, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (or CPAN) hosts 221,742 Perl modules written by 14,548 authors. This week they announced that the CPAN Security Group "was authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)" to assign and manage CVE vulnerability identifications for Perl and CPAN Modules. 

"This is great news!" posted Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman on social media, saying the announcement came "Just in time for my talk about this very topic in a few weeks about how all open source projects should be doing this" at the Linux Foundation Member Summit in Napa, California. And Curl creator Daniel Stenberg posted "I'm with Greg Kroah-Hartman on this: all Open Source projects should become CNAs. Or team up with others to do it." (Also posting "Agreed" to the suggestion was Seth Larson, the Python Software Foundation's security developer-in-residence involved in their successful effort to become a CNA in 2023.) 

444 CNAs have now partnered with the CVE Program, according to their official web site. The announcement from PerlMonks.org:

Years ago, a few people decided during the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS) that it would be a good idea to join forces, ideas and knowledge and start a group to monitor vulnerabilities in the complete Perl ecosystem from core to the smallest CPAN release. The goal was to follow legislation and CVE reports, and help authors in taking actions on not being vulnerable anymore. That group has grown stable over the past years and is now known as CPANSec. 

The group has several focus areas, and one of them is channeling CVE vulnerability issues. In that specific goal, a milestone has been reached: CPANSec has just been authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for Perl and modules on CPAN

So the blog post calls for a "common framework" for "defining specific, measurable criteria for achieving different levels of memory safety assurance." The hope is this gives policy makers "the technical foundation to craft effective policy initiatives and incentives promoting memory safety" leading to "a market in which vendors are incentivized to invest in memory safety." ("Customers will be empowered to recognize, demand, and reward safety.") 

In January the same Google security researchers helped co-write an article noting there are now strong memory-safety "research technologies" that are sufficiently mature: memory-safe languages (including "safer language subsets like Safe Buffers for C++"), mathematically rigorous formal verification, software compartmentalization, and hardware and software protections. (With hardware protections including things like ARM's Memory Tagging Extension and the (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, or "CHERI", architecture.) Google's security researchers are now calling for "a blueprint for a memory-safe future" — though Importantly, the idea is "defining the desired outcomes rather than locking ourselves into specific technologies." 

Their blog post this week again urges a practical/actionable framework that's commonly understood, but one that supports different approaches (and allowing tailoring to specific needs) while enabling objective assessment:

At Google, we're not just advocating for standardization and a memory-safe future, we're actively working to build it. We are collaborating with industry and academic partners to develop potential standards, and our joint authorship of the recent CACM call-to-action marks an important first step in this process... This commitment is also reflected in our internal efforts. We are prioritizing memory-safe languages, and have already seen significant reductions in vulnerabilities by adopting languages like Rust in combination with existing, wide-spread usage of Java, Kotlin, and Go where performance constraints permit. We recognize that a complete transition to those languages will take time. That's why we're also investing in techniques to improve the safety of our existing C++ codebase by design, such as deploying hardened libc++. 

This effort isn't about picking winners or dictating solutions. It's about creating a level playing field, empowering informed decision-making, and driving a virtuous cycle of security improvement... The journey towards memory safety requires a collective commitment to standardization. We need to build a future where memory safety is not an afterthought but a foundational principle, a future where the next generation inherits a digital world that is secure by design. 
The security researchers' post calls for "a collective commitment" to eliminate memory-safety bugs, "anchored on secure-by-design practices..." One of the blog post's subheadings? "Let's build a memory-safe future together." 

And they're urging changes "not just for ourselves but for the generations that follow."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kaizen!

The new model seems to prove that longstanding rumors of diminishing returns in training unsupervised-learning LLMs were correct and that the so-called "scaling laws" cited by many for years have possibly met their natural end.An AI expert who requested anonymity told Ars Technica, "GPT-4.5 is a lemon!" when comparing its reported performance to its dramatically increased price, while frequent OpenAI critic Gary Marcus called the release a "nothing burger" in a blog post (though to be fair, Marcus also seems to think most of what OpenAI does is overrated).Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that GPT-4.5 is better than GPT-4o but in ways that are subtle and difficult to express. "Everything is a little bit better and it's awesome," he wrote, "but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Do Websockets Work ✨</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/how-do-websockets-work</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cf1bf388-28af-4284-b0df-1f95b80f0df6_1280x720.gif" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 13:41:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get the powerful template to approach system design for FREE on newsletter sign-up:This post outlines how websockets work. You’ll find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there lived a student named Jonas.Although extremely bright, he struggled with chemistry lessons. And spent countless hours doing homework.So he was sad and frustrated.Until one day, he decides to ask for help with homework from his friend, Emma.And shares a Google Document with her.The changes have to be visible in real-time to both of them, which means a bidirectional communication pattern is necessary.Let’s quickly look into potential communication patterns to handle this use case:The client requests the server for an update, and the server responds after processing it. Although this approach is simple and efficient, the client has to request the server again for an update. So it isn’t real-time.Imagine  as automatically refreshing the browser every few seconds to check a stock’s price.The client  asks the server for an update, while the server returns an empty response if nothing has changed. It can track changes in real time.Yet there are some problems with this approach:Responsiveness depends on the interval between requests.Extra overhead from connection requests and empty responses.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  as asking a restaurant waiter for food, and then waiting at the counter until it's ready.The client requests, and the server responds only when there’s an update. Put simply, the server doesn’t send an empty response; instead, it  the request and waits for an update to occur. Yet the server sends an empty response on timeout. And client has to make an extra request to receive every change.Although it allows real-time communication, there are some problems with this approach:The server has to maintain many open connections, and it consumes resources.The client has to make a separate request for sending data to the server.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  like a radio broadcast, it's one way and listeners can't talk back to the radio station.The client requests the server, and it creates an open connection with the client.The server then updates the client whenever anything changes. Yet the communication is , and the client has to make a separate request to send data to the server.So it's inefficient for this use case.Meet Trae, an adaptive AI IDE that transforms how you work, collaborating with you to run faster:Simply describe your project needs in natural language, and watch it built by Trae.Upload your design files and let Trae assist in translating your visual concepts into clean, workable code.As you code, Trae learns your project patterns and provides contextually relevant suggestions to help you code more efficiently.Google Docs use websockets for bidirectional communication in real-time.Imagine  as a telephone call, both people can talk at the same time.1. Opening a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of opening a websockets connection is called the .The client sends an HTTP GET request to the server asking for a websocket connection.The HTTP request includes specific headers.The handshake is complete and opens a Transmission Control Protocol () connection for bidirectional communication.The client and server can exchange data in both directions in real-time. It supports text and binary data formats.2. Transferring Data Through WebsocketsA websocket message can be split into frames for performance. A frame contains information such as payload data in binary syntax. A frame allows the sender to have only a small buffer to keep data. The receiver then assembles the frames to reconstruct the original websocket message.3. Closing a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of closing a websocket connection is called .The client or server can close the connection. A websocket frame with a specific code is used to signal the close. The connection is closed after the receiver acknowledges it.The server then deallocates the resources.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re on Twitter:Websocket is efficient because it can send updates through a single connection.Yet it needs a persistent and stateful connection between the client and server. While a server can handle only limited websocket connections because of memory and socket limitations.Although good for specific use cases, it isn’t a silver bullet for real-time communication.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in March 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of
1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the
iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent
kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even
once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the .)Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latencyThe iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and
has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large
Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a
number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of
Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top
level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service
IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain
# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O
# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT
# etc...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK
This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel
to check it against all of the Service rules is  in the number
of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and
the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection
increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and
worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP
address appears earlier or later in the  chain).By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like
this is to have a  rule, using a "verdict map" to do the
dispatch:table ip kube-proxy {
# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.
map service-ips {
type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict
comment "ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic"
elements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,
172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,
172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,
... }
}
# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an
# element in the map. (This rule says, "construct a tuple from the
# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look
# that tuple up in "service-ips"; and if there's a match, execute the
# associated verdict.)
chain services {
ip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips
}
...
}
Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly  map lookup,
packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster
size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the
iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000
Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as
the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000
Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for
nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few
microseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to
squint to see the nftables results!:Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latencyWhile the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are
great, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often
keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:
the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when
Services and their endpoints change.With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a
whole (actual rules, plus associated data) is  in the combined
number of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables
backend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of
thousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of
iptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving
kube-proxy so that it could skip updating  of the unchanged
rules in each update, but the limitations of  as an
API meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's
 in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller
constant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can
still be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's  config
option to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to
push iptables updates.The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and
when kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the
update is only  in the number of Services and endpoints that
have changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of
Services and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each
nftables-using component to have its own private table also means that
there is no global lock contention between components like with
iptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much
more efficiently than with iptables.(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump
right into using the nftables backend for now.First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit
tests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in
the real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as
much real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise
that it is as stable and bug-free.Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;
currently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of
bugs in early versions of the  command line tool, you should not
run kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier
than 1.0.0) version of  in the host filesystem (or else
kube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables
on the system).Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such
as the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet
support kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the
documentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components
to see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they
will not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or
override kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether
kube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability
and monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data
for kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in
iptables mode.Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%
compatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old
kube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less
performant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that
changing the default would be a compatibility break. Since the
nftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad
defaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In
particular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only
reachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable
on all IPs, including , with iptables mode.) The
kube-proxy documentation has more information about this, including
information about metrics you can look at to determine if you are
relying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration
options are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to
pass  to kube-proxy (or set  in
your kube-proxy config file).You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to
nftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the
kube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting
in nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs
rules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs
mode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)As mentioned above, while nftables is now the  kube-proxy mode,
it is not the , and we do not yet have a plan for changing
that. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main
advantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of
the IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes
(for example, the fact that the  device needs to have
 Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of
Kubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement
using IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have
different endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a
local or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same
performance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of
the downsides:(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use
various other IPVS functionality, like alternative "schedulers" for
balancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,
because kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS
schedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the
proxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic
more cleverly.)While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop
the IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people
who are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode
instead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in
nftables mode that you can't work around).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mastering event sourcing</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53MW-lk3vdM</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/53MW-lk3vdM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 18:05:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

In a candid blog post, Construct developer Ashley explains why maintaining large software projects is a burden most programmers fail to appreciate. "Writing the initial code for a feature is only a fraction of the work," Ashley explains, estimating it represents just "25% of the total work" in Construct's 750,000-line codebase. The rest? A grinding cycle of "testing, diagnosing and fixing bugs, optimizing performance, upgrading it to work with other changes, refactoring, customer support, writing documentation and similarly revising the documentation over time." 

Ashley describes how accepting code contributions feels like someone offering to build you a free extension -- initially attractive until the roof starts leaking years later and the original builder is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, your tenants (users) are furious, and you're stuck with "no good options." The post recounts Construct's own bruises: a community-contributed storage plugin still causing compatibility headaches a decade later, and third-party libraries that became maintenance nightmares after their creators vanished. 

These experiences explain why seasoned maintainers eye large code contributions with deep suspicion rather than gratitude. "If you suggest some software project uses some code -- even a small amount -- will you be there in literally 10 year's time sorting out all the issues that arise from it?" Ashley asks. "Usually the answer is no."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building for application developers (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/630</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/630/the-changelog-630.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anurag Goel, Founder/CEO of Render, joins Adam to discuss what they’re doing to solve cloud problems for application developers.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito.

An anonymous reader quotes an excerpt from the report: ExpressVPN is one of ZDNET's favorite Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The popular VPN's transformation of its Lightway codebase from C to Rust promises to make the service faster and more secure. For now, the updated Lightway 2.0 is only available via ExpressVPN's Aircove router with the February 4 AircoveOS v5 update. The Aircove, which we rate as the best VPN router, costs $189. With this device, you can protect your tech from unwanted snoopers without installing a VPN on each gadget. So, how much faster is the updated ExpressVPN? In my tests, I connected to the internet via my updated router over my 2 Gigabit per second (Gbps) AT&T Internet using a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet-connected Linux Mint desktop with a Wi-Fi 6 connection over my Samsung Galaxy 25 Plus smartphone.
 
Without the VPN engaged, I saw 1.6 Gbps speeds, which is about par. With the VPN switched on and using Lightway 2.0, I saw speeds in the 290 to 330 Megabit per second (Mbps) range to Toronto and London, England. Farther afield, I saw speeds around 250 to 280Mbps to Hong Kong and Seoul. That's about 20% faster than I had seen with earlier Lightway versions. I was impressed. This version of the VPN should also be more secure. As Pete Membrey, ExpressVPN's chief research officer, said in a statement: "At ExpressVPN, we innovate to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Upgrading Lightway from its previous C code to Rust was a strategic and straightforward decision to enhance performance and security while ensuring longevity."
 
The updated Lightway VPN protocol also uses ML-KEM, the newly finalized NIST standard for post-quantum encryption. This feature, wrote Membray in a blog post, "ensures your connection is secured by encryption designed not just for today's threats but for the quantum-powered challenges of the future." To ensure the integrity of the recoded Lightway protocol, ExpressVPN commissioned two independent security audits from cybersecurity firms Cure53 and Praetorian. Both audits yielded positive results, with only minor vulnerabilities identified and promptly addressed by ExpressVPN. In short, ExpressVPN is technically about as safe a VPN as they come.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2279 - Ky Dickens</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF0CrAx_sBM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gF0CrAx_sBM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 18:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ky Dickens is a filmmaker and documentarian.

Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can --feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mary, Queen of Scots</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bc86d019249d0c1a6d8f00/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=GtxOZiLfcAbHNEsURMPrACCd_6JUDRhfgf4gUf5H13Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.

      Michael Pratt
      26 February 2025
      The hash table is a central data structure in computer science, and it provides the implementation for the map type in many languages, including Go.The concept of a hash table was first described by Hans Peter Luhn in 1953 in an internal IBM memo that suggested speeding up search by placing items into “buckets” and using a linked list for overflow when buckets already contain an item.
Today we would call this a hash table using chaining.With data structures that have been around this long, it’s easy to think that they must be “done”; that we know everything there is to know about them and they can’t be improved anymore.
That’s not true!
Computer science research continues to make advancements in fundamental algorithms, both in terms of algorithmic complexity and taking advantage of modern CPU hardware.
For example, Go 1.19 switched the  package from a traditional quicksort, to pattern-defeating quicksort, a novel sorting algorithm from Orson R. L. Peters, first described in 2015.Go 1.24 includes a completely new implementation of the built-in map type, based on the Swiss Table design.
In this blog post we’ll look at how Swiss Tables improve upon traditional hash tables, and at some of the unique challenges in bringing the Swiss Table design to Go’s maps.Open-addressed hash tableSwiss Tables are a form of open-addressed hash table, so let’s do a quick overview of how a basic open-addressed hash table works.In an open-addressed hash table, all items are stored in a single backing array.
We’ll call each location in the array a .
The slot to which a key belongs is primarily determined by the , .
The hash function maps each key to an integer, where the same key always maps to the same integer, and different keys ideally follow a uniform random distribution of integers.
The defining feature of open-addressed hash tables is that they resolve collisions by storing the key elsewhere in the backing array.
So, if the slot is already full (a ), then a  is used to consider other slots until an empty slot is found.
Let’s take a look at a sample hash table to see how this works.Below you can see a 16-slot backing array for a hash table, and the key (if any) stored in each slot.
The values are not shown, as they are not relevant to this example.To insert a new key, we use the hash function to select a slot.
Since there are only 16 slots, we need to restrict to this range, so we’ll use  as the target slot.
Suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 7 is empty, so we simply insert 98 there.
On the other hand, suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 3 is a collision because it already contains key 56.
Thus we cannot insert here.We use a probe sequence to find another slot.
There are a variety of well-known probe sequences.
The original and most straightforward probe sequence is , which simply tries successive slots in order.So, in the  example, since slot 3 is in use, we would consider slot 4 next, which is also in use.
So too is slot 5.
Finally, we’d get to empty slot 6, where we’d store key 25.Lookup follows the same approach.
A lookup of key 25 would start at slot 3, check whether it contains key 25 (it does not), and then continue linear probing until it finds key 25 in slot 6.This example uses a backing array with 16 slots.
What happens if we insert more than 16 elements?
If the hash table runs out of space, it will grow, usually by doubling the size of the backing array.
All existing entries are reinserted into the new backing array.Open-addressed hash tables don’t actually wait until the backing array is completely full to grow because as the array gets more full, the average length of each probe sequence increases.
In the example above using key 25, we must probe 4 different slots to find an empty slot.
If the array had only one empty slot, the worst case probe length would be O(n).
That is, you may need to scan the entire array.
The proportion of used slots is called the , and most hash tables define a  (typically 70-90%) at which point they will grow to avoid the extremely long probe sequences of very full hash tables.The Swiss Table design is also a form of open-addressed hash table.
Let’s see how it improves over a traditional open-addressed hash table.
We still have a single backing array for storage, but we will break the array into logical  of 8 slots each.
(Larger group sizes are possible as well. More on that below.)In addition, each group has a 64-bit  for metadata.
Each of the 8 bytes in the control word corresponds to one of the slots in the group.
The value of each byte denotes whether that slot is empty, deleted, or in use.
If it is in use, the byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash for that slot’s key (called ).Insertion works as follows:Compute  and break the hash into two parts: the upper 57-bits (called ) and the lower 7 bits (called ).The upper bits () are used to select the first group to consider:  in this case, as there are only 2 groups.Within a group, all slots are equally eligible to hold the key. We must first determine whether any slot already contains this key, in which case this is an update rather than a new insertion.If no slot contains the key, then we look for an empty slot to place this keyIf no slot is empty, then we continue the probe sequence by searching the next group.Lookup follows the same basic process.
If we find an empty slot in step 4, then we know an insertion would have used this slot and can stop the search.Step 3 is where the Swiss Table magic happens.
We need to check whether any slot in a group contains the desired key.
Naively, we could just do a linear scan and compare all 8 keys.
However, the control word lets us do this more efficiently.
Each byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash () for that slot.
If we determine which bytes of the control word contain the  we are looking for, we’ll have a set of candidate matches.In other words, we want to do a byte-by-byte equality comparison within the control word.
For example, if we are looking for key 32, where , the operation we want looks like so.This is an operation supported by SIMD hardware, where a single instruction performs parallel operations on independent values within a larger value (). In this case, we can implement this operation using a set of standard arithmetic and bitwise operations when special SIMD hardware is not available.The result is a set of candidate slots.
Slots where  does not match do not have a matching key, so they can be skipped.
Slots where  does match are potential matches, but we must still check the entire key, as there is potential for collisions (1/128 probability of collision with a 7-bit hash, so still quite low).This operation is very powerful, as we have effectively performed 8 steps of a probe sequence at once, in parallel.
This speeds up lookup and insertion by reducing the average number of comparisons we need to perform.
This improvement to probing behavior allowed both the Abseil and Go implementations to increase the maximum load factor of Swiss Table maps compared to prior maps, which lowers the average memory footprint.Go’s built-in map type has some unusual properties that pose additional challenges to adopting a new map design.
Two were particularly tricky to deal with.When a hash table reaches its maximum load factor, it needs to grow the backing array.
Typically this means the next insertion doubles the size of the array, and copies all entries to the new array.
Imagine inserting into a map with 1GB of entries.
Most insertions are very fast, but the one insertion that needs to grow the map from 1GB to 2GB will need to copy 1GB of entries, which will take a long time.Go is frequently used for latency-sensitive servers, so we don’t want operations on built-in types that can have arbitrarily large impact on tail latency.
Instead, Go maps grow incrementally, so that each insertion has an upper bound on the amount of growth work it must do.
This bounds the latency impact of a single map insertion.Unfortunately, the Abseil (C++) Swiss Table design assumes all at once growth, and the probe sequence depends on the total group count, making it difficult to break up.Go’s built-in map addresses this with another layer of indirection by splitting each map into multiple Swiss Tables.
Rather than a single Swiss Table implementing the entire map, each map consists of one or more independent tables that cover a subset of the key space.
An individual table stores a maximum of 1024 entries.
A variable number of upper bits in the hash are used to select which table a key belongs to.
This is a form of , where the number of bits used increases as needed to differentiate the total number of tables.During insertion, if an individual table needs to grow, it will do so all at once, but other tables are unaffected.
Thus the upper bound for a single insertion is the latency of growing a 1024-entry table into two 1024-entry tables, copying 1024 entries.Modification during iterationMany hash table designs, including Abseil’s Swiss Tables, forbid modifying the map during iteration.
The Go language spec explicitly allows modifications during iteration, with the following semantics:If an entry is deleted before it is reached, it will not be produced.If an entry is updated before it is reached, the updated value will be produced.If a new entry is added, it may or may not be produced.A typical approach to hash table iteration is to simply walk through the backing array and produce values in the order they are laid out in memory.
This approach runs afoul of the above semantics, most notably because insertions may grow the map, which would shuffle the memory layout.We can avoid the impact of shuffle during growth by having the iterator keep a reference to the table it is currently iterating over.
If that table grows during iteration, we keep using the old version of the table and thus continue to deliver keys in the order of the old memory layout.Does this work with the above semantics?
New entries added after growth will be missed entirely, as they are only added to the grown table, not the old table.
That’s fine, as the semantics allow new entries not to be produced.
Updates and deletions are a problem, though: using the old table could produce stale or deleted entries.This edge case is addressed by using the old table only to determine the iteration order.
Before actually returning the entry, we consult the grown table to determine whether the entry still exists, and to retrieve the latest value.This covers all the core semantics, though there are even more small edge cases not covered here.
Ultimately, the permissiveness of Go maps with iteration results in iteration being the most complex part of Go’s map implementation.In microbenchmarks, map operations are up to 60% faster than in Go 1.23.
Exact performance improvement varies quite a bit due to the wide variety of operations and uses of maps, and some edge cases do regress compared to Go 1.23.
Overall, in full application benchmarks, we found a geometric mean CPU time improvement of around 1.5%.There are more map improvements we want to investigate for future Go releases.
For example, we may be able to increase the locality of operations on maps that are not in the CPU cache.We could also further improve the control word comparisons.
As described above, we have a portable implementation using standard arithmetic and bitwise operations.
However, some architectures have SIMD instructions that perform this sort of comparison directly.
Go 1.24 already uses 8-byte SIMD instructions for amd64, but we could extend support to other architectures.
More importantly, while standard instructions operate on up to 8-byte words, SIMD instructions nearly always support at least 16-byte words.
This means we could increase the group size to 16 slots, and perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel instead of 8.
This would further decrease the average number of probes required for lookups.A Swiss Table-based Go map implementation has been a long time coming, and involved many contributors.
I want to thank YunHao Zhang (@zhangyunhao116), PJ Malloy (@thepudds), and @andy-wm-arthur for building initial versions of a Go Swiss Table implementation.
Peter Mattis (@petermattis) combined these ideas with solutions to the Go challenges above to build github.com/cockroachdb/swiss, a Go-spec compliant Swiss Table implementation.
The Go 1.24 built-in map implementation is heavily based on Peter’s work.
Thank you to everyone in the community that contributed!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Claude 3.7 goes hard for programmers…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2WtHZciC74</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x2WtHZciC74?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:27:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Convex for free, the only database designed to be generated https://convex.link/fireship

This January was the hottest ever recorded globally, yet it also snowed in Florida and was icy in Texas? How? Well, global warming might actually be making winter storms colder. It all has to do with the polar jetstream — a boundary of air that’s in flux depending on the differences in temperature around the globe. What effect might climate change be having on it?

Unlike a monolithic system, a distributed system has no central point of control, meaning it must handle challenges like data consistency, network latency, and system failures.Debugging distributed systems is conventionally considered challenging because modern architectures consist of numerous microservices communicating across networks, making failures difficult to isolate. The challenges and maintenance burdens can magnify as systems grow in size and complexity.Julia Blase is a Product Manager at Chronosphere where she works on features to help developers troubleshoot distributed systems more efficiently, including Differential Diagnosis, or DDx.

These book are not tied to any specific library, tool or framework; instead, they focus on  that can be applied to any tech stack.They cover multiple aspects of building software, from coding and design patterns to distributed systems, microservices, and designing good APIs. I also found most of them very helpful when preparing for . is all about writing high-quality, maintainable code. The author, Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), provides guidelines and best practices for structuring your code, naming variables, handling errors, and more.You’ll learn how to make your code more readable and easier to understand, not just for yourself but for any developer who might read it later. It also covers principles like the Single Responsibility Principle, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and how to effectively refactor your code when it starts to get messy.How it can help your career:Writing clean code is one of the most important skills for a Software Engineer. By applying the principles in this book, you’ll be able to deliver features faster, avoid technical debt, and stand out as someone who values code quality. This can open up opportunities for leadership roles and help you perform better in coding interviews.Head First Design Patterns uses a fun, engaging style to teach you the core design patterns you’ll encounter in everyday software development. The book breaks down each pattern in a visually-rich format, making it easier to understand why and when to use them.You’ll learn how to recognize common problems in code and how to solve them using design patterns like the Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern, Singleton Pattern, and more. This book makes heavy use of code examples and diagrams, so it’s great for visual learners.How it can help your career:Design patterns are frequently asked about in technical interviews, and they also come up a lot when you’re collaborating with other engineers. Having a solid understanding of design patterns will help you write flexible, scalable solutions and communicate better with your peers about how to structure your code.This book focuses on how to build systems that handle large amounts of data reliably, efficiently, and securely. It covers topics like data modeling, database internals, distributed systems, transactions, and scalability.You’ll gain a deep understanding of how different storage systems work (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) and how to handle big data challenges. Martin Kleppmann explains concepts like replication, partitioning, and consistency in a way that is easy to grasp, even if you’re new to distributed systems.How it can help your career:As data volumes grow in almost every company, understanding how to design data-intensive systems is a crucial skill. This knowledge is also extremely valuable in System Design Interviews, where you’re often asked about scalability, reliability, and performance. gives a detailed look at how to design and implement microservice-based systems. Sam Newman walks through the fundamentals of what microservices are, why they’re useful, and how to manage the challenges that come with them.You’ll learn about service boundaries, communication patterns (like synchronous vs. asynchronous), testing strategies for microservices, and how to deploy and monitor distributed systems. The book also covers organizational aspects—such as team structures—that can support a microservices architecture.How it can help your career:Microservices are widely adopted in modern tech companies, and many architectural interviews will delve into your understanding of them. Knowing how to break a monolith into microservices and handle issues like service discovery, API gateways, and observability can make you a stronger candidate for senior engineering roles. focuses on the practical aspects of creating robust, well-documented, and user-friendly APIs. It covers the entire process—from planning and design to documentation and versioning. It includes expert advice, worksheets, checklists, and case studies from companies including Slack, Stripe, Facebook, and GitHub.You’ll discover how to define API requirements, choose the right data formats (like JSON, XML), and handle authentication and rate-limiting. The book also addresses collaboration between teams and how to involve stakeholders in the API design process.How it can help your career:APIs are at the heart of modern software systems. Whether you’re building internal services or public APIs, understanding how to design them effectively makes you more valuable to your team. It also comes up in interviews if you’re applying for roles where you need to talk about RESTful or GraphQL APIs, integration points, and best practices for scaling APIs, handling security and managing changes.There are other great books that I haven’t mentioned in this article.Do let me know your favorite Software Engineering books in the comments.

As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI killed the tech interview.

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Not just because of the verticality and fluidity it introduced to traversal, but also because of its vital role in combat--whether you were incorporating Silkbind attacks into combos or using the Wire-dash to avoid certain death by the skin of your teeth. The Wirebug was a fantastic addition, and yet its absence is something I never really felt in Monster Hunter Wilds. Such is the strength of its combat, the seamlessness of its open world, and the impact both of these facets have on a core gameplay loop that remains infinitely compelling. There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series.For seasoned veterans, that core gameplay loop will be instantly recognizable. You hunt monsters, craft their parts to make better weapons and armor, and then use these upgrades to hunt even more challenging monsters. It's an evergreen formula, although an emphasis on narrative hasn't always been part of the equation. The lone exception is 2018's Monster Hunter World, and in many ways, Wilds feels like a continuation of that game's approach to storytelling. By integrating Guild and Village quests into one cohesive story with multiple characters and a fully voiced protagonist, Capcom clearly intends for the story to be more than the afterthought it has traditionally been.The game's opening moments see the Hunter's Guild arrive in the Forbidden Lands: an uncharted region believed to be uninhabited for the past thousand-odd years. This misconception changed, however, when a young boy named Nata was discovered near the border. Pensive and frightened, Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a fearsome monster known as the White Wrath, forcing the Hunter's Guild to embark on an expedition to investigate this mysterious creature and potentially save Nata's Indigenous people from annihilation. As a hunter, it's your role to slay a bestiary of monsters and protect the balance of the ecosystem in this dangerous new frontier.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fedora Amicably Resolves Legal Threat From OBS Studio Over Downstream Flatpak</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/24/0438216/fedora-amicably-resolves-legal-threat-from-obs-studio-over-downstream-flatpak?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to application packaging, earlier this month the site Its FOSS complained that Fedora Flatpaks "are often unmaintained or broken, leading to a poor experience for users who aren't usually aware they're using them." And this apparently created friction with OBS Studio, the free/open-source screencasting and streaming app. 

"We are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork," OBS Studio lead Joel Bethke posted in on GitLab's page for Fedora Flatpaks. They said they were making "a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution. Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken...." (Issues with Fedora's packaging led "to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package..." Bethke said in his original Issue. "I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds.") 

23 people clicked "Like" on the original Issue — but threatening legal action only happened after Bethke felt Fedora was unresponsive, according to It's FOSS:
In a comment on a video by Brodi Robertson (check pinned comment), Joel shared that folks from Fedora were not taking this issue seriously, with one of them even resorting to name-calling by labeling the OBS Studio devs as being "terrible maintainers". Since then, a major step has been taken by Neal Gompa, a well-known Fedora contributor and member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo). He has opened a new issue to remove Fedora's OBS Studio flatpak from the registry as soon as possible. 
But by Tuesday Bethke posted in a new comment on GitLab announcing that "a very good conversation" with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader seemed to have cleared the tension. "We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are... [T]he OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks." To the issue of not knowing where to report bugs for the downstream package, "We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point." As for other issues with Fedora's Flatpak for OBS Studio, "The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve..." 

And similar sentiments were echoed on Fedora's own issue tracker. "We had a good conversation today, and there is a hopeful path forward that does not require the OBS Project distancing itself from Fedora Flatpaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Soho: London&apos;s Most Notorious Neighbourhood</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/soho-londons-most-notorious-neighbourhood</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67b85b7161b0b0034978a439/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmRGXDSfjZDg2qWbQDZfaox2_QT4byoFAB_X1QSIGTc" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Soho was once a thriving melting pot of speakeasies, sex work and organised crime.

Linux's second-in-command Greg Kroah-Hartman has also been a big proponent of Rust kernel code. He's crafted another Linux kernel mailing list post [Wednesdsay] outlining the benefits of Rust and encouraging new kernel code/drivers to be in Rust rather than C. Greg KH makes the case that the majority of the kernel bugs are due to "stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust." 

"As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years... and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic," Kroah-Hartman began. Here's some excerpts from his remarks. Citing corner cases like overwrites of memory, error path cleanups, use-after-free mistakes and forgetting to check error values, Kroah-Hartman says he's "all for... making these types of problems impossible to hit."

That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)... [F]or new code / drivers, writing them in Rust where these types of
bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of
us, why wouldn't we do this...? Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that...? 

Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. 

Kroah-Hartman emphasized later that "a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) " 

The complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that " #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2277 - Woody Harrelson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ztXzOIH7x10?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 18:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Woody Harrelson is an actor, playwright, and activist.

Highlights from Torvalds' response:

The fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying "as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for". 

And that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust — which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... 

You don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: 

 "The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust" 

that is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... 

You can't have it both ways. You can't say "I want to have nothing to do with Rust", and then in the very next sentence say "And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that "wall of protection" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. 

But that "wall of protection" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the "nobody is forced to deal with Rust" does not imply "everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code".
 
Torvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including "I respect you technically, and I like working with you."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge with Voice Agents</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Challenge-with-Voice-Agents-e2v7kj7</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98865191/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-22%2F395336812-44100-2-5e30b9d18237d.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:50:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode Two, Demetrios, Paul, and Floris explore the latest in Voice AI agents.

All passport applicants should be allowed to select whatever gender markers they feel best fit, including M, F, or X.In humans, neither sex nor gender is binary at any level. There are several possible arrangements of sex chromosomes: X, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXX, tetrasomies, pentasomies, etc. A single person can contain a mosaic of cells with different genetics: some XX, some XYY. Chromosomes may not align with genitalia: people with XY chromosomes may have a vulva and internal testes. People with XY chromosomes and a small penis may be surgically and socially reassigned female at birth—and never told what happened. None of these biological dimensions necessarily align with one’s internal concept of gender, or one’s social presentation.The executive order has no idea how biology works. It defines “female” as “a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell”. Zygotes do not produce reproductive cells at all: under this order none  of us have a sex. Oogenesis doesn’t start until over a month into embryo development. Even if people were karyotyping their zygotes immediately after conception so they could tell what “legal” sex they were going to be, they could be wrong: which gametes we produce depends on the formation of the genital ridge.All this is to say that if people fill out these forms using this definition of sex, they’re guessing at a question which is both impossible to answer and socially irrelevant. You might be one of the roughly two percent of humans born with an uncommon sexual development and not even know it. Moreover, the proposed change fundamentally asks the wrong question: gender markers on passports are used by border control agents, and are expected to align with how those agents read the passport holder’s gender. A mismatch will create needless intimidation and hardship for travelers.Of course most of us will not have our identities challenged under this order. That animus is reserved for trans people, for gender-non-conforming people, for anyone whose genetics, body, dress, voice, or mannerisms don’t quite fit the mold. Those are the people who will suffer under this order. That cruelty should be resisted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Change my mind (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/81</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/81/changelog--friends-81.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod and Adam use Chris Kiehl’s post on development topics he’s changed his mind on (over the last 10 years) as a proxy for discussion on dev things they HAVE and HAVE NOT changed their minds on.Changelog++ members save 9 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

But Cabernet dares to go deeper with its message, delving into the cyclical nature of humanity's cruelty to each other, especially regarding the treatment of the lower class, and how society's many ills are often the result of the new rich inheriting the evils of the old. It all makes for a deeply compelling consequence-driven story where every choice carries the potential to surprise you with terrifying force. Some late-game glitches mar the game's fantastic conclusion, but even if developer Party for Introverts doesn't address those issues in post-launch updates, the journey to get to Cabernet's final hour is an incredible piece of interactive fiction.A 2D narrative-driven RPG set in 19th century Eastern Europe, Cabernet begins with protagonist Liza's funeral, as you briefly roleplay as her uncle and give a eulogy that determines the direction of Liza's life and which skills she specializes in. Control then shifts to Liza as you awake in a dungeon. Unsure of how she got there, Liza makes a pact with an unseen and silent presence for freedom, before finding herself at a party filled with vampires. It quickly becomes apparent that she is now a vampire as well, and this new life comes with a ton of rules, like needing to satiate a constant thirst for blood and staying away from sunlight. But there are immense freedoms associated with the transformation as well, as Liza is empowered with supernatural abilities that allow her to go to places she never could before, get away with acts others are often swiftly arrested for, and pursue passions and love most mortals of her station cannot yet readily do.In this sense, Liza is a stand-in for the middle class, which was emerging during this period in real-life history. Liza cannot relate to the centuries-old Countess who commands all the vampires in the region and lives in a mansion filled with wealth, nor can she completely empathize with the poor farmer girl who dreams of learning music and bettering herself but must toil away in the fields for hours so her family can eat. But Liza can take small steps into both of their worlds to see their respective trials and tribulations, and although she cannot fundamentally change the relationship between the poor and rich, she is one of the few in town who can affect the lives of people in both social spheres. This setup grounds the otherwise supernatural fantasy in real-world politics, implementing considerations into the story that give even the simplest of choices substantial narrative weight.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft’s new chip looks like science fiction…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwnez8HdN7E</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jwnez8HdN7E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:24:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using FIRESHIP code, and get free CodeRabbit for 1-month https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

I just set up a basic geoblock with Nginx on Debian. This is all stuff you can piece together, but the Maxmind and Nginx docs are a little vague about the details, so I figure it’s worth an actual writeup. My Nginx expertise is ~15 years out of date, so this might not be The Best Way to do things. YMMV.First, register for a free MaxMind account; you’ll need this to subscribe to their GeoIP database. Then set up a daemon to maintain a copy of the lookup file locally, and Nginx’s GeoIP2 module:apt install geoipupdate libnginx-mod-http-geoip2
Create a license key on the MaxMind site, and download a copy of the config file you’ll need. Drop that in . It’ll look like:AccountID XXXX
LicenseKey XXXX
EditionIDs GeoLite2-Country
The package sets up a cron job automatically, but we should grab an initial copy of the file. This takes a couple minutes, and writes out /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country-mmdb:The GeoIP2 module should already be loaded via /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-geoip2.conf. Add a new config snippet like /etc/nginx/conf.d/geoblock.conf. The first part tells Nginx where to find the GeoIP database file, and then extracts the two-letter ISO country code for each request as a variable. The  part sets up an  variable, which is set to  for GB, otherwise .geoip2 /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb {
  $geoip2_data_country_iso_code country iso_code;
}

map $geoip2_data_country_iso_code $osa_geoblocked {
  GB      1;
  default 0;
}
Write an HTML file somewhere like /var/www/custom_errors/osa.html, explaining the block. Then serve that page for HTTP 451 status codes: in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/whatever, add:server {
  ...
  # UK OSA error page
  error_page 451 /osa.html;
  location /osa.html {
    internal;
    root /var/www/custom_errors/;
  }

  # When geoblocked, return 451
  location / {
    if ($osa_geoblocked = 1) {
      return 451;
    }
  }
}
Test your config with , and then . You can test how things look from the UK using a VPN service, or something like locabrowser.This is, to be clear, a bad solution. MaxMind’s free database is not particularly precise, and in general IP lookup tables are chasing a moving target. I know for a fact that there are people in non-UK countries (like Ireland!) who have been inadvertently blocked by these lookup tables. Making those people use Tor or a VPN , but I don’t know what else to do in the current regulatory environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Agent Landscape - Lessons Learned Putting Agents Into Production</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Agent-Landscape---Lessons-Learned-Putting-Agents-Into-Production-e2v4mfj</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98768819/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-20%2F395239664-44100-2-65b015000e8a8.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:53:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode One, Demetrios chats with Paul van der Boor and Floris Fok about the real-world challenges of deploying AI agents across  @ProsusGroup  of companies.

Since web applications frequently rely on databases, querying a database on every request can be slow and inefficient, leading to high response times and increased server load. solves this problem by storing frequently accessed data in memory, significantly reducing latency and offloading queries from the database.There are multiple caching strategies (read through, cache aside, write back etc.,) each suited for different use cases.The  pattern is widely used because it gives the application full control over caching logic.When a client requests data, the application first checks Redis.If the data exists in Redis (), it is returned instantly.If data is not found (), it is fetched from the database, stored in Redis for future requests, and returned to the client.Code Example: Caching API ResponsesTo prevent stale or outdated data, Redis allows setting  (), ensuring automatic eviction of cached entries.Most modern web applications are , meaning they don’t store session information directly on the server. However, to keep users logged in, maintain shopping carts, or track user preferences, web applications need a reliable session management system.Since Redis is andprovide  options, it’s a great choice for storing session data.The application generates a unique session ID for the user.It stores session data in Redis, using the session ID as the key.The session ID is sent to the user's browser as a .The application retrieves the session ID from the user's cookie.It fetches user data from Redis using the session ID.If a user is inactive for too long, Redis automatically deletes the session after a set expiration time ().This prevents stale session accumulation, optimizing memory usage.Code Example: Storing and Retrieving SessionsSince Redis is an in-memory database, all session data is lost if the server restarts.Redis allows saving session data to disk using snapshots () or AOF logging.However, reloading session data after a crash may take too long, causing delays.Using Redis Replication for High Availability (Recommended for Production)Sessions are replicated to a backup Redis instance.If the primary Redis server fails, the backup is promoted to take over.This ensures minimal downtime for user sessions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Programming with LLMs (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/629</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/629/the-changelog-629.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past year, David Crawshaw has intentionally sought ways to use LLMs while programming, in order to learn about them.

In 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks …. good!

But de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.

Here’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.

But the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.

      Damien Neil
      19 February 2025
      One of Go’s signature features is built-in support for concurrency.
Goroutines and channels are simple and effective primitives for
writing concurrent programs.However, testing concurrent programs can be difficult and error prone.In Go 1.24, we are introducing a new, experimental
 package
to support testing concurrent code. This post will explain the motivation behind
this experiment, demonstrate how to use the synctest package, and discuss its potential future.In Go 1.24, the  package is experimental and
not subject to the Go compatibility promise.
It is not visible by default.
To use it, compile your code with  set in your environment.Testing concurrent programs is difficultTo begin with, let us consider a simple example.The  function
arranges for a function to be called in its own goroutine after a context is canceled.
Here is a possible test for :func TestAfterFunc(t *testing.T) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

    calledCh := make(chan struct{}) // closed when AfterFunc is called
    context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
        close(calledCh)
    })

    // TODO: Assert that the AfterFunc has not been called.

    cancel()

    // TODO: Assert that the AfterFunc has been called.
}
We want to check two conditions in this test:
The function is not called before the context is canceled,
and the function  called after the context is canceled.Checking a negative in a concurrent system is difficult.
We can easily test that the function has not been called ,
but how do we check that it  be called?A common approach is to wait for some amount of time before
concluding that an event will not happen.
Let’s try introducing a helper function to our test which does this.// funcCalled reports whether the function was called.
funcCalled := func() bool {
    select {
    case <-calledCh:
        return true
    case <-time.After(10 * time.Millisecond):
        return false
    }
}

if funcCalled() {
    t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
}

cancel()

if !funcCalled() {
    t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
}
This test is slow:
10 milliseconds isn’t a lot of time, but it adds up over many tests.This test is also flaky:
10 milliseconds is a long time on a fast computer,
but it isn’t unusual to see pauses lasting several seconds
on shared and overloaded
CI
systems.We can make the test less flaky at the expense of making it slower,
and we can make it less slow at the expense of making it flakier,
but we can’t make it both fast and reliable.Introducing the testing/synctest packageThe  package solves this problem.
It allows us to rewrite this test to be simple, fast, and reliable,
without any changes to the code being tested.The package contains only two functions:  and . calls a function in a new goroutine.
This goroutine and any goroutines started by it
exist in an isolated environment which we call a .
 waits for every goroutine in the current goroutine’s bubble
to block on another goroutine in the bubble.Let’s rewrite our test above using the  package.func TestAfterFunc(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

        funcCalled := false
        context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
            funcCalled = true
        })

        synctest.Wait()
        if funcCalled {
            t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
        }

        cancel()

        synctest.Wait()
        if !funcCalled {
            t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
        }
    })
}
This is almost identical to our original test,
but we have wrapped the test in a  call
and we call  before asserting that the function has been called or not.The  function waits for every goroutine in the caller’s bubble to block.
When it returns, we know that the context package has either called the function,
or will not call it until we take some further action.This test is now both fast and reliable.The test is simpler, too:
we have replaced the  channel with a boolean.
Previously we needed to use a channel to avoid a data race between
the test goroutine and the  goroutine,
but the  function now provides that synchronization.The race detector understands  calls,
and this test passes when run with .
If we remove the second  call,
the race detector will correctly report a data race in the test.Concurrent code often deals with time.Testing code that works with time can be difficult.
Using real time in tests causes slow and flaky tests,
as we have seen above.
Using fake time requires avoiding  package functions,
and designing the code under test to work with
an optional fake clock.The  package makes it simpler to test code that uses time.Goroutines in the bubble started by  use a fake clock.
Within the bubble, functions in the  package operate on the
fake clock. Time advances in the bubble when all goroutines are
blocked.To demonstrate, let’s write a test for the
 function.
 creates a child of a context,
which expires after a given timeout.func TestWithTimeout(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        const timeout = 5 * time.Second
        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
        defer cancel()

        // Wait just less than the timeout.
        time.Sleep(timeout - time.Nanosecond)
        synctest.Wait()
        if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("before timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want nil", err)
        }

        // Wait the rest of the way until the timeout.
        time.Sleep(time.Nanosecond)
        synctest.Wait()
        if err := ctx.Err(); err != context.DeadlineExceeded {
            t.Fatalf("after timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want DeadlineExceeded", err)
        }
    })
}
We write this test just as if we were working with real time.
The only difference is that we wrap the test function in ,
and call  after each  call to wait for the context
package’s timers to finish running.A key concept in  is the bubble becoming .
This happens when every goroutine in the bubble is blocked,
and can only be unblocked by another goroutine in the bubble.When a bubble is durably blocked:If there is an outstanding  call, it returns.Otherwise, time advances to the next time that could unblock a goroutine, if any.Otherwise, the bubble is deadlocked and  panics.A bubble is not durably blocked if any goroutine is blocked
but might be woken by some event from outside the bubble.The complete list of operations which durably block a goroutine is:a send or receive on a nil channela send or receive blocked on a channel created within the same bubblea select statement where every case is durably blockingOperations on a  are not durably blocking.It is common for functions to acquire a global mutex.
For example, a number of functions in the reflect package
use a global cache guarded by a mutex.
If a goroutine in a synctest bubble blocks while acquiring
a mutex held by a goroutine outside the bubble,
it is not durably blocked—it is blocked, but will be unblocked
by a goroutine from outside its bubble.Since mutexes are usually not held for long periods of time,
we simply exclude them from ’s consideration.Channels created within a bubble behave differently from ones created outside.Channel operations are durably blocking only if the channel is bubbled
(created in the bubble).
Operating on a bubbled channel from outside the bubble panics.These rules ensure that a goroutine is durably blocked only when
communicating with goroutines within its bubble.External I/O operations, such as reading from a network connection,
are not durably blocking.Network reads may be unblocked by writes from outside the bubble,
possibly even from other processes.
Even if the only writer to a network connection is also in the same bubble,
the runtime cannot distinguish between a connection waiting for more data to arrive
and one where the kernel has received data and is in the process of delivering it.Testing a network server or client with synctest will generally
require supplying a fake network implementation.
For example, the  function
creates a pair of s that use an in-memory network connection
and can be used in synctest tests.The  function starts a goroutine in a new bubble.
It returns when every goroutine in the bubble has exited.
It panics if the bubble is durably blocked
and cannot be unblocked by advancing time.The requirement that every goroutine in the bubble exit before Run returns
means that tests must be careful to clean up any background goroutines
before completing.Let’s look at another example, this time using the 
package to test a networked program.
For this example, we’ll test the  package’s handling of
the 100 Continue response.An HTTP client sending a request can include an “Expect: 100-continue”
header to tell the server that the client has additional data to send.
The server may then respond with a 100 Continue informational response
to request the rest of the request,
or with some other status to tell the client that the content is not needed.
For example, a client uploading a large file might use this feature to
confirm that the server is willing to accept the file before sending it.Our test will confirm that when sending an “Expect: 100-continue” header
the HTTP client does not send a request’s content before the server
requests it, and that it does send the content after receiving a
100 Continue response.Often tests of a communicating client and server can use a
loopback network connection. When working with ,
however, we will usually want to use a fake network connection
to allow us to detect when all goroutines are blocked on the network.
We’ll start this test by creating an  (an HTTP client) that uses
an in-memory network connection created by .func Test(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        srvConn, cliConn := net.Pipe()
        defer srvConn.Close()
        defer cliConn.Close()
        tr := &http.Transport{
            DialContext: func(ctx context.Context, network, address string) (net.Conn, error) {
                return cliConn, nil
            },
            // Setting a non-zero timeout enables "Expect: 100-continue" handling.
            // Since the following test does not sleep,
            // we will never encounter this timeout,
            // even if the test takes a long time to run on a slow machine.
            ExpectContinueTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        }
We send a request on this transport with the “Expect: 100-continue” header set.
The request is sent in a new goroutine, since it won’t complete until the end of the test.        body := "request body"
        go func() {
            req, _ := http.NewRequest("PUT", "http://test.tld/", strings.NewReader(body))
            req.Header.Set("Expect", "100-continue")
            resp, err := tr.RoundTrip(req)
            if err != nil {
                t.Errorf("RoundTrip: unexpected error %v", err)
            } else {
                resp.Body.Close()
            }
        }()
We read the request headers sent by the client.        req, err := http.ReadRequest(bufio.NewReader(srvConn))
        if err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("ReadRequest: %v", err)
        }
Now we come to the heart of the test.
We want to assert that the client will not send the request body yet.We start a new goroutine copying the body sent to the server into a ,
wait for all goroutines in the bubble to block, and verify that we haven’t read anything
from the body yet.If we forget the  call, the race detector will correctly complain
about a data race, but with the  this is safe.        var gotBody strings.Builder
        go io.Copy(&gotBody, req.Body)
        synctest.Wait()
        if got := gotBody.String(); got != "" {
            t.Fatalf("before sending 100 Continue, unexpectedly read body: %q", got)
        }
We write a “100 Continue” response to the client and verify that it now sends the
request body.        srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n\r\n"))
        synctest.Wait()
        if got := gotBody.String(); got != body {
            t.Fatalf("after sending 100 Continue, read body %q, want %q", got, body)
        }
And finally, we finish up by sending the “200 OK” response to conclude the request.We have started several goroutines during this test.
The  call will wait for all of them to exit before returning.        srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n"))
    })
}
This test can be easily extended to test other behaviors,
such as verifying that the request body is not sent if the server does not ask for it,
or that it is sent if the server does not respond within a timeout.We are introducing 
in Go 1.24 as an  package.
Depending on feedback and experience
we may release it with or without amendments,
continue the experiment,
or remove it in a future version of Go.The package is not visible by default.

The thread in full can be found on the Rust for Linux mailing list.
 
[Here's an excerpt from the thread:] "I don't think having a web page in any form is useful. If you want it to be valid it has to be in the kernel tree and widely agreed on. It also states factually incorrect information. E.g. 'Some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected.' while Linus in private said that he absolutely is going to merge Rust code over a maintainers objection. (He did so in private in case you are looking for a reference). So as of now, as a Linux developer or maintainer you must deal with Rust if you want to or not. [...] Right now the rules is Linus can force you whatever he wants (it's his project obviously) and I think he needs to spell that out including the expectations for contributors very clearly."

It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021. Kenny is currently founder and CEO of Hyperparam, building new tools to make AI dataset curation orders of magnitude more efficient. ~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Google Interview Question Everyone Gets Wrong</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFVrncgIvos</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dFVrncgIvos?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:03:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you smart enough to solve this Google interview question?

Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is exactly as it sounds, with Goro Majima returning as a fully fledged protagonist for the first time since 2015's Yakuza 0. Unlike that game--which saw Kiryu share the spotlight--the focus this time around is squarely on everyone's favorite eyepatched goofball: the perfect leading man for one of the series' more bizarre entries. No one commits to the bit quite like Majima, which is partly why Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii avoids the risk of diminishing returns, despite being the third Like a Dragon game in the past 15 months. This high-seas adventure doesn't stack up against the series' best, but the pirate theme does just enough to differentiate a jaunty return to the Hawaii.Set six months after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii opens with Majima waking up on a beach somewhere in the Pacific. He has no memory of how he got there, his name, or his storied past as a crime boss/cabaret manager/construction-company owner. All he knows is that a young boy named Noah saved his life, and for whatever reason, Hawaii and the surrounding islands are now full of cutlass-wielding pirates who look like they've been pulled out of Tortuga during the 1600s. What follows is the hunt for a long-lost legendary treasure that sees Majima reinvent himself as the pirate captain of his own ship, complete with an ever-expanding crew of new and familiar characters. Stuffing the coffers with booty might be the end goal, but this is also a tale about the friends we made along the way.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Free Software Foundation Speaks Up Against Red Hat Source Code Announcement</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/02/18/0953205/free-software-foundation-speaks-up-against-red-hat-source-code-announcement?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PAjamian writes: Two years ago Red Hat announced an end to its public source code availability.

However, this method is highly dependent on the number of servers, and any change in N can lead to , causing a major redistribution of keys (requests). addresses this issue by ensuring that only a small subset of keys need to be reassigned when nodes are added or removed.Popularized by , it has now become a fundamental technique in distributed databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra and ScyllaDB.In this article, we’ll explore what consistent hashing is, why it’s needed, how it works, and how to implement it in code.Imagine you're building a high-traffic web application that serves millions of users daily. To handle the load efficiently, you distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers using a .Your system consists of  (), and requests are assigned using a hash function that maps each user's IP address to a specific server.The process works like this:The load balancer takes a user’s IP address (or session ID).A  maps the IP to one of the backend servers by taking the sum of bytes in the IP address and computing  (since we have 5 servers).The request is routed to the assigned server, ensuring that the same user is always directed to the same server for session consistency.Everything Works Fine… Until You ScaleThis approach works as long as the number of servers remains constant. But what happens when you ?Scenario 1: Adding a New Server (S5)As traffic increases, you decide to  by adding a new backend server (). Now, the hash function must be modified to use  instead of since we have 6 servers now.This seemingly simple change completely disrupts the existing mapping, causing most users to be reassigned to different servers.This results into , leading to high overhead, and potential downtime.Scenario 2: Removing a Server (S4)Now, let’s say one of the servers () fails or is removed. The number of servers drops to 4, forcing the hash function to switch from  to .Even though only  server was removed, most users are reassigned to different servers. This can cause:Active users may be logged out or disconnected.Cached data becomes irrelevant, increasing database load.Severe performance degradation: The system may struggle to run efficiently.The Solution: Consistent Hashing offers a more scalable and efficient solution by ensuring that only a  are reassigned when scaling up or down.It performs really well when operated in dynamic environments, where the system scales up and down frequently.Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used to efficiently distribute data across multiple nodes (servers, caches, etc.).It uses a  (hash ring) with a large and constant hash space.Both nodes (servers, caches, or databases) and keys (data items) are mapped to positions on this hash ring using a .Unlike modulo-based hashing, where changes in the number of nodes cause large-scale remapping, consistent hashing ensures that only a small fraction of keys are reassigned when a node is added or removed, making it highly scalable and efficient.In consistent hashing, when the number of nodes changes, only keys need to be reassigned, where  is the total number of keys and  is the total number of nodes.2.1 Constructing the Hash RingInstead of distributing keys based on , consistent hashing places both servers and keys on a circular hash ring.We use a large, fixed hash space ranging from  to  (assuming a 32-bit hash function).This creates a circular structure, where values wrap around after reaching the maximum limit.Placing Servers on the RingEach  is assigned a position on the hash ring by computing .Using the above example with , the hash function distributes them at different positions around the ring.When a key is added, its position is determined by computing .Example: a user’s request is assigned a position on the ring based on the hash of their IP address: We then move clockwise around the ring until we find the next available server.The key (or request) is assigned to this server for storage or retrieval. In case a key’s hash falls directly on a node’s position, it belongs to that node.Suppose we add a to the system.The position of  falls between  and  in the hash ring. takes over all keys (requests) that fall between  and , which were previously handled by .requests which were originally assigned to  will now be redirected to This demonstrates how consistent hashing efficiently redistributes keys with minimal disruption, ensuring that only a small subset of keys are reassigned when new servers are added.When a server, such as , fails or is removed from the system:All keys previously assigned to  are reassigned to the next available server in the ring ().Only the keys (requests) that were mapped to  need to move, while all other keys remain unaffected.This results in , unlike traditional hashing where removing a node would require reassigning most keys.In , each server is assigned  on the hash ring. However, this can lead to , especially when:The number of servers is small.Some servers accidentally get clustered together, creating .A server is , causing a sudden load shift to its immediate neighbor. are a technique used in consistent hashing to improve  and  by distributing data more evenly across servers.Instead of assigning one position per server, each physical server is assigned  (virtual nodes) on the hash ring.Each server is hashed multiple times to different locations on the ring.When a request (key) is hashed, it is assigned to the next virtual node in a clockwise direction.The request is then routed to the actual server associated with the virtual node.Assume we have three physical servers (S1, S2, S3). Without virtual nodes, their positions might be:S1 → Position 10
S2 → Position 50
S3 → Position 90If , all its keys must be reassigned to , which can create an overload.With , each server is hashed multiple times:S1-1 → Position 10
S1-2 → Position 70
S1-3 → Position 120
S2-1 → Position 50
S2-2 → Position 80
S2-3 → Position 160
S3-1 → Position 30
S3-2 → Position 90
S3-3 → Position 140Now, instead of just one point,  is represented at , making the distribution .If , its keys are more evenly redistributed among , rather than all going to .Stores hash values → server mappings. Uses  (replicas) for better load balancing.Maintains a  of hash values for efficient lookups.Tracks active physical servers.Calls  for each server, hashing it multiple times (based on ) to ensure even distribution.Uses  to convert strings into large integers for consistent placement on the hash ring.Generates multiple hash values for each server (, , etc.).Stores these in  and maintains a sorted order in  for fast lookup.Deletes the server’s hash values and its virtual nodes from  and .Hashes the input key and finds the closest  server using .

Many engineers fall into the day-to-day routine of writing code without a clear idea of how to grow their careers.This happened to me. At my first job at Amazon, I landed code without knowing what I could do to grow my skills. I left that job within eight months because I felt I wasn’t growing as an engineer. Three years later, I made it to Staff Software Engineer at Instagram after tons of mentorship. Early on, I learned that being good at coding wasn’t enough to get promoted; you have to think strategically about your career and often need to develop new behaviors to move up.In this article, I’ll share everything that helped me fast-track my way up the ladder, from developing the right mindset to making key moves that many overlook. Even if rapid growth isn’t your goal, this guide has learnings for all tech career paths.Software Engineering LevelsAn Algorithm for PromotionJunior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Software Engineering LevelsNote: “IC” = “Individual Contributor”In software engineering, companies measure career progression by levels that measure both behaviors and impact within the company. While the exact titles and structure can vary between companies, most tech companies follow a similar system: - Early in your career, working on smaller, well-defined tasks with guidance from more experienced engineers. - More autonomous, handling moderately complex projects, and beginning to take initiative in improving the codebase and what they build. - Leading larger projects with team-level influence. You’ll mentor and guide the team while having a broad impact on the codebase.: Focusing on cross-team collaboration and solving org-wide challenges. Staff engineers are strategic thinkers who influence the technical direction of their organization.Senior Staff Engineer and Beyond (IC7+): Senior staff engineers and up operate with top technical expertise, driving large-scale initiatives that have a broad impact on the company. Senior staff engineers mentor staff engineers and work closely with executive leadership to meet business objectives.Your impact and compensation increase as you progress, which is a lot more satisfying in my experience. Not to mention that the skills that get you promoted also let you control what you and the company work on.Also, many companies consider only senior engineers (IC5) and higher to be “terminal levels.” You must eventually get promoted to IC5, or you’ll be managed out. Most engineers are promoted in time, so it’s not meant to scare you but to encourage you to grow.An Algorithm For PromotionThere’s a common set of steps across all promotions that will get you to Staff:1) Exceed expectations at your current level - Your manager will be hesitant to find you opportunities at the next level if they have concerns about your performance at the current level. Also, when your manager puts together a promotion packet, it’ll contain a history of your past ratings. The promotion committee will have concerns about your packet if you have a history of only meeting expectations for your level. Work with your manager to understand the expectations for your level and how to exceed them.2) Be direct with your manager about promotion - Once you know you’re exceeding expectations for your level, ask your manager what next-level performance looks like. Your manager plays a huge role in your promotion. They build your case and advocate for it, so they have a lot of influence on this process. Also, the lower the level, the more control your manager has. IC3 -> IC4 promotions are straightforward, so your manager’s perspective is usually what happens. For IC5 -> IC6, there is a lot more ambiguity, so your manager serves more as a middleman between you and the promotion committee. Your manager still plays a significant role in writing your packet and delivering feedback.3) Find next-level scope - If you only work on projects that fit your level’s behaviors, you won’t get any closer to promotion, no matter how good your work is. One simple pattern for finding next-level scope is brainstorming projects with engineers who are 1-2 levels higher than you are. Often, they will have a lot of projects sitting in their backlog that are big enough to help you get promoted. If you take on one of their projects, they’ll often help mentor you, review your designs and code, and give you strong peer feedback for your future promotion packet. I wrote more on this here. Make sure to confirm with your manager that they agree that what you’re working on fits the behaviors of the next level.4) Maintain next-level behaviors and impact - The duration you need to perform at the next level varies depending on your level and your company. At minimum though, you need to maintain that performance for 6-12 months. This is because promotions are “lagging” in tech. You must prove that you’re already operating at the next level before getting promoted. This reduces the risk of failing to meet expectations at the new level.Getting promoted faster is a matter of doing steps (1), (2) and (3) as fast as possible. The best you can do is immediately start exceeding expectations in your first half and working with your manager on the next level.Almost every team has scope for more Senior Engineers (IC5). You can get promoted up to that level if you have the skills and behaviors. Past that, situation and business scope play a much larger role. Many teams don’t need someone who has Staff-level leadership and technical skills. If you find yourself stuck at any point due to your situation, you’ll likely have to switch teams to continue growing your career.Now that you have the algorithm that applies at any of these levels let’s get into the level-specific strategies. I’ll share what got me promoted and what I would change if I did it again.Junior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What the Upcoming Dark Sky Collapse Will Do to Earth</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ5OpCDVmaI</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CJ5OpCDVmaI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:30:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔒Remove your personal information from the web at https://joindeleteme.com/ASTRUM and use code ASTRUM for 20% off 🙌 DeleteMe international Plans: https://international.joindeleteme.com

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is The Perfect Bowling Strategy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqo1lQL59VI</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mqo1lQL59VI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the optimal strategy for bowling? #science #veritasium #physics #bowling]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
