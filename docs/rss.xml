The document reveals a notable shift in OpenAI's content policies, particularly around "sensitive" content like erotica and gore -- allowing this type of content to be generated without warnings in "appropriate contexts." The change in policy has been in the works since May 2024, when the original Model Spec document first mentioned that OpenAI was exploring "whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT."
 
ChatGPT's guidelines now state that that "erotica or gore" may now be generated, but only under specific circumstances. "The assistant should not generate erotica, depictions of illegal or non-consensual sexual activities, or extreme gore, except in scientific, historical, news, creative or other contexts where sensitive content is appropriate," OpenAI writes. "This includes depictions in text, audio (e.g., erotic or violent visceral noises), or visual content." So far, experimentation from Reddit users has shown that ChatGPT's content filters have indeed been relaxed, with some managing to generate explicit sexual or violent scenarios without accompanying content warnings. OpenAI notes that its Usage Policies still apply, which prohibit building AI tools for minors that include sexual content.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI says its board of directors ‘unanimously’ rejects Elon Musk’s bid</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/openai-says-its-board-of-directors-unanimously-rejects-musks-bid/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:45:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI’s board of directors has “unanimously” rejected billionaire Elon Musk’s offer to buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI, the company said on Friday.

The multi-billion dollar project will connect the U.S., Brazil, India, South Africa, and other key regions. The system utilizes 24 fiber pairs and introduces what Meta describes as "first-of-its-kind routing" that maximizes cable placement in deep water at depths up to 7,000 meters. 

The company developed new burial techniques for high-risk areas near coasts to protect against ship anchors and other hazards. A joint statement from President Trump and Prime Minister Modi confirmed India's role in maintaining and financing portions of the undersea cables in the Indian Ocean using "trusted vendors." According to telecom analysts Telegeography, Meta currently has ownership stakes in 16 subsea networks, including the 2Africa cable system that encircles the African continent.

It exploits “device code flow,” a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide OAuth standard. Authentication through device code flow is designed for logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These devices typically don’t support browsers, making it difficult to sign in using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a computer or other device that’s easier to sign in with and enters the code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained device that logs it into the account.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Munich attack: Suspect admits deliberate car ramming | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulb0DS5MiNs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ulb0DS5MiNs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:15:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The car ramming into a rally in the Bavarian capital on Thursday has left at least 36 injured, German authorities said.

Protesters, some of whom have performed at the Kennedy Center in the past, asserted that drag is a form of art, and that supporters of drag are supporters of the arts.
 
The protest, co-organized by several D.C. local collectives, came just after Trump took over the Center, with his board appointees naming him chair and then firing its president, Deborah Rutter. 🔗 Tap the link to find out which former U.S. ambassador now serves as the Center's interim president.

From a report: Over the next three years, global electricity consumption is set to rise by an "unprecedented" 3,500 terawatt hours, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. That's an addition each year of more than Japan's annual electricity consumption. 

The roughly 4% annual growth in that period is the fastest such rate in years, underscoring the growing importance of electricity to the world's overall energy needs. "The acceleration of global electricity demand highlights the significant changes taking place in energy systems around the world and the approach of a new Age of Electricity," Keisuke Sadamori, IEA's director of energy markets and security, said in a statement. "But it also presents evolving challenges for governments in ensuring secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Eagles hold Super Bowl victory parade</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPouQQSBf2Y</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vPouQQSBf2Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:41:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philadelphia Eagles hold a victory parade after their Super Bowl win

Since then, I've been banned twice and shadow-banned several times.1) Right after I created my account, I got shadow-banned. My friends couldn’t find me, and my profile wasn’t accessible via direct link. This issue wasn’t resolved until I contacted support; they confirmed that restrictions had been placed on my account and then removed them.2) I shouldn’t even have to mention this, but as a professional in my field, after that incident I always ended up on the very last pages of search results for keywords related to my field. People without those keywords in their resumes, or whose work isn’t at all related to the field, kept being ranked ahead of me. I can’t say I was deliberately pessimized, but that’s exactly how it appears.3) Some time later, I decided to get Premium and paid with my own card (issued in another country, with the same name as on my profile and my passport). That’s when I received the first restriction: I was locked out of my account and couldn’t sign in until I contacted support. They made me take a photo of myself and of my passport, and after that they lifted the restrictions and apologized.4) Everything seemed to be going along normally, yet I remained stuck on the last pages of search, being outranked by completely irrelevant profiles, until I decided to write a post about my own article on Medium. Immediately after publishing the post with a link to Medium, I received a second restriction. I was locked out of my account, couldn’t access my messages or interview invitations, and even missed a call because of this. They once again required me to submit a photo of myself along with a copy of my passport. Although they eventually restored my account, this time the process took 4–5 days, which caused me to miss an interview.5) Now my profile is accessible via direct link, but I’ve disappeared from search. No one can find me, and hardly anyone visits my page. My post was hidden while support was "sorting out" my account, and I lost all the potential post views it would have gained because it wasn't featured in the recommendations.All of this happened within the first three months of using LinkedIn. I’ve never seen a more appalling social media, one so full of dark patterns and outright abuse towards its users, forcing them through humiliating identity verification processes and hiding them from search.Needless to say, I have never violated any of the platform’s rules. I don’t spam, I don’t bother people, and I don’t advertise anything. Meanwhile, my friend, whose account is over five years old—can do whatever he wants. He uses VPNs, changes his profile location several times a week, and switches his VPN location from Dubai to Europe multiple times a day without ever facing any restrictions.And yes, I completely forgot to add: when your account gets restricted, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a premium user or not — the treatment is equally poor and the response is equally slow.I’ve never seen a worse social media, and I’d be thrilled if a worthy competitor to LinkedIn ever emerged, I’d be one of the first to join.BONUS: This content was originally posted on reddit, quickly became popular in the LinkedIn subreddit and was then deleted by moderator who works for M$ (which owns LinkedIn). Frankly, it feels like the whole LinkedIn subreddit is highly censored by him.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, said to be in talks to raise $10B</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/elon-musks-ai-company-xai-said-to-be-in-talks-to-raise-10b/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:54:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, is said to be in talks to raise $10 billion in a round that would value xAI at $75 billion.

It was a big miss and any evidence that consumer resilience is cracking is a red flag, given they have been the backbone of US economic recovery from the pandemic era. 

This underscores the importance of tariffs as a catalyst for markets, as a lot of cost is expected to be passed on to consumers. Uncertainty over the timing and implementation of such levies is still up in the air. 

Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni explains why he remains bullish and says the Federal Reserve has "accomplished" its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Ed speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

From a report: The Sydney-based firm, Minotaur Capital, was founded by Armina Rosenberg and Thomas Rice. Rosenberg previously managed a global equities portfolio for tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and ran Australian small-company research for JPMorgan Chase & Co. when she was 25. Rice is a former portfolio manager at Perpetual. The duo's bets on global stocks returned 13.7% in the six months ending January, versus 6.7% for the MSCI All-Country World Index. Minotaur has no analysts on staff, with Rosenberg saying AI models are far quicker and cheaper. 

"We're looking at about half the price" in terms of cost of AI versus a junior analyst salary, Rosenberg, 37, said of the firm's program. Minotaur is among a growing number of hedge funds experimenting with ways to improve returns and cut expenses with AI as the technology becomes increasingly sophisticated. Still, the jury is still out on the ability of AI-driven models to deliver superior returns over the long run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia spearheads Arab alternative to Trump&apos;s Gaza plan | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ev5KIU59Q</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n7ev5KIU59Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:17:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is leading Arab efforts to find a rival proposal for Gaza to Donald Trump's plan for the United States to build a 'Middle East Riviera.'

"Democracy was called into question by the US vice president for the whole of Europe earlier," Pistorius said at the Munich Security Conference. "He speaks of the annihilation of democracy. And if I have understood him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions... that is not acceptable." Pistorius accused Vance of painting a distorted picture of democracy. With the German elections just over a week away, and the far-right AfD in second place in the polls, Pistorius poured scorn on the notion that free speech was being stymied. Democracy means that "extremist parties such as the AfD can campaign quite normally, just like any other party. However, democracy does not mean that the loud minority is automatically right and determines the truth," Pistorius said. Earlier, JD Vance said that free speech was "in retreat" in Europe while mass migration was a topic being underestimated by nations across the continent.

He’s not just been very vocal about it, but also brought up some arguments against the use of C++ that are worth reviewing in detail.C and C++ are almost the same, except they aren’t. C++ is often considered the object oriented “version” of C. The successor to it, if you will. But C++ is rather an extension to C. Bringing object orientation, constructors, destructors, templates, exception handling, namespaces and operator overloading. All these extensions come with their very own challenges and paradigms. Unsurprisingly, Linus’ technical arguments against C++ all have their roots in these extensions.The main arguments that Linus brought forward against C++ can be found in the kernel mailing list under “Compiling C++ kernel module + Makefile” and the respective responses that date back as far as 2004. Let’s wipe the personal disputes off these messages and focus on the arguments.Exception handling in C++“the whole C++ exception handling thing is fundamentally broken. It’s _especially_ broken for kernels.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Munich Security Conference 2025 Day 1, with JD Vance, Ursula von der Leyen, Wang Yi | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3y4Nihxvh0</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/D3y4Nihxvh0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:42:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From February 14-16, 2025, the 61st Munich Security Conference is the center of international diplomacy.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Delphi Is 30</title><link>https://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/2025-february-delphi-is-30.html</link><author>andsoitis</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:41:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Outside NY court as judge hears case on Elon Musk’s DOGE accessing Treasury records</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGa2sMIVWAA</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pGa2sMIVWAA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:37:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Live from a New York courthouse as a federal judge hears a lawsuit aiming to block Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency(DOGE) from accessing Treasury Department records with sensitive personal data on millions of Americans.

The turtles raise their heads out of water, open their mouths, flap their flippers and spin in circles.Not only is this “turtle dancing behavior” cute, it was also the key to unlocking a significant scientific discovery by researchers at UNC-Chapel Hill.The prestigious international science journal Nature published the study Feb. 12. Kayla Goforth, a recent doctoral graduate in the College of Arts and Sciences’ biology department, is the lead author of “Learned magnetic map cues and two mechanisms of magnetoreception in turtles.”Early on in her graduate studies at Carolina, Goforth was fascinated by sea turtles returning to the same feeding sites again and again throughout their lifetimes — despite traveling up to 10,000 miles across the planet. She hypothesized that these turtles used Earth’s magnetic field to memorize specific geographic areas that they associated with food, and she devised an experiment in the biology department’s Lohmann Lab — run by husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Catherine Lohmann.“Kayla began to wonder if we could get the turtles to associate the magnetic signature of a geographic area with food — and therefore act out this turtle dance behavior,” said Kenneth Lohmann, the Charles P. Postelle Jr. Distinguished Professor of Biology. “She really took the lead in this. I wasn’t at all sure in the beginning whether it would work, but we were happy to have her try, and it turned out remarkably well.”The team of Carolina researchers analyzed how sea turtles use Earth’s magnetic field to guide their long-distance migrations across the ocean, and how the turtles sense magnetic fields.Goforth and the rest of the all-Carolina team conditioned loggerhead turtles to magnetic fields replicating those that exist in various oceanic locations, repeatedly feeding the turtles in some magnetic fields while not feeding them in others. When later exposed to the fields in which they were fed, the turtles exhibited “turtle dancing behavior,” indicating that they associated that specific magnetic signature with food.“That’s how we figured out what to measure, just by watching them do this as we were feeding them in the lab,” said Goforth, who is now conducting postdoctoral research at Texas A&M University. “When they get really excited, they stick their heads out; they slap their flippers wildly; they spin in place sometimes.”The assay suggests that loggerhead sea turtles can learn the magnetic signatures of geographical areas — much like dropping a pin in a GPS app.The groundbreaking study was published in the prestigious international science journal Nature. (Ken Lohmann/biology department)When turtles use magnetic signatures, they are using their magnetic map sense, but they also have a magnetic compass sense that enables them to move north, south or some other direction. The research further showed that the map and compass senses detect magnetic fields in different ways.Working in collaboration with the College’s physics and astronomy department, the team investigated the effects of radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields on the turtles’ magnetic senses. What the team found surprised them. The oscillating magnetic fields had no impact on the turtles’ magnetic map ability but did disrupt the turtles’ ability to use the magnetic compass and orient themselves.“It suggested there are two different mechanisms for the magnetic map and compass,” Goforth said. “And they might have evolved separately.”Exactly how turtles and other migratory species use these senses is a question that has baffled scientists for more than 50 years, and it’s one that Goforth continues to research at Texas A&M, now studying monarch butterflies instead of sea turtles.“The big question is always the mechanism,” Goforth said. “What’s the mechanism and what is the sensor? We know that for the visual sense, you have eyes; for the sense of smell, you have a nose; and for hearing, you have ears. But no receptor like that has been identified for the magnetic sense, and the mechanism remains unknown.”(Ken Lohmann/biology department)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hoff Twins for the win</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmKiyu2lbNQ</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NmKiyu2lbNQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:17:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic triple/double buffering merge request for GNOME was just merged!</title><link>https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1441</link><author>/u/joojmachine</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:09:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI and security startups blossom on cloudy days</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/ai-and-security-startups-blossom-on-cloudy-days/</link><author>Anna Heim</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 18:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups.

The data often arrives as individual events or small batches, which requires an operational database to capture. Features like time partitioning help optimize the storage layout for time range filtering and efficient deletion of old data.The PostgreSQL feature set gives you a lot of flexibility for handling a variety of IoT scenarios, but there are certain scenarios for it is less suitable, namely:Long-term archival of historical dataFast, interactive analytics on the source dataIdeally, data would get automatically archived in cheap storage, in a format optimized for large analytical queries.We developed two open source Postgres extensions that help you do that:pg_parquet can export (and import) query results to the Parquet file format in object storage using regular COPY commandspg_incremental can run a command for a never-ending series of time intervals or files, built on top of pg_cronWith some simple commands, you can set up a reliable, fully automated pipeline to export time ranges to the columnar Parquet format in S3.Then, you can use a variety of analytics tools to query or import the data. My favorite is of course Crunchy Data Warehouse.On any PostgreSQL server that has the pg_parquet and pg_incremental extensions, you can set up a pipeline that periodically exports data to in S3 in two steps.The pg_incremental extension has a create_time_interval_pipeline function that will run a given command once the time interval has passed, with 2 timestamp parameters set to the start and end of the hour. We cannot directly use query parameters in a COPY command, but we can define a simple PL/pgSQL function that generates and executes a custom COPY command using the parameters.-- existing raw data table
create table events (
  event_id bigint not null generated by default as identity,
  event_time timestamptz not null default now(),
  device_id bigint not null,
  sensor_1 double precision
);

insert into events (device_id, sensor_1)
values (297, 20.4);


insert into events (device_id, sensor_1)
values (297, 20.4);

-- define an export function that wraps a COPY command
create or replace function export_events(start_time timestamptz, end_time timestamptz)
returns void language plpgsql as $function$
begin
  execute format(
    $$
      copy (select * from events where event_time >= %L and event_time < %L)
      to 's3://mybucket/events/%s.parquet' with (format 'parquet');
    $$,
    start_time, end_time, to_char(start_time, 'YYYY-MM-DD-HH')
  );
end;
$function$;

-- export events hourly from the start of the year, and keep exporting in the future
select incremental.create_time_interval_pipeline('event-export',
  time_interval := '1 hour',                      /* export data by the hour                */
  batched := false,                               /* process 1 hour at a time               */
  start_time := '2025-01-01',                     /* backfill from the start of the year    */
  source_table_name := 'events',                  /* wait for writes on events to finish    */
  command := $$ select export_events($1, $2) $$   /* run export_events with start/end times */
);

By running these commands, Postgres will export all the data from the start of the year into hourly Parquet files in S3, and will keep doing so after every hour and automatically retry on failure.To use pg_parquet Crunchy Bridge, you can add your S3 credentials for pg_parquet to your Postgres server via the dashboard under Settings -> Data lake.Once data is in Parquet, you can use a variety of tools and approaches to query the data. If you want to keep using Postgres, you can use Crunchy Data Warehouse which has two different ways of working with Parquet data.The simplest way to start querying Parquet files in S3 in Crunchy Data Warehouse is to use a lake analytics table. You can easily create a table for all Parquet files that match a wildcard pattern:create foreign table events_parquet ()
server crunchy_lake_analytics
options (path 's3://mybucket/events/*.parquet');
You can then immediately query the data and the files get cached in the background, so queries will quickly get faster.A downside of querying Parquet directly is that eventually we will have a lot of hourly files that match the pattern, and there will be some overhead from listing them for each query (listing is not cached). We also cannot easily change the schema later.A more flexible approach is to import the Parquet files into an Iceberg table. Iceberg tables are also backed by Parquet in S3, but the files are compacted and optimized, and the table supports transactions and schema changes.You can create an Iceberg table that has the same schema as a set of Parquet files using the definition_from option. You could also load the data using load_from, but we’ll do that separately.create table events_iceberg () using iceberg
with (definition_from = 's3://mybucket/events/*.parquet');
Now we need a way to import all existing Parquet files and also import new files that show up in S3 into Iceberg. This is another job for pg_incremental. Following a similar approach as before, we create a function to generate a COPY command using a parameter.-- define an import function that wraps a COPY command to import from a URL
create function import_events(path text)
returns void language plpgsql as $function$
begin
  execute format($$copy events_iceberg from %L$$, path);
end;
$function$;

-- create a pipeline to import new files into a table, one by one.
-- $1 will be set to the path of a new file
select incremental.create_file_list_pipeline('event-import',
   file_pattern := 's3://mybucket/events/*.parquet',
   list_function := 'crunchy_lake.list_files',
   command := $$ select import_events($1) $$,
);

-- optional: do compaction immediately
vacuum events_iceberg;

After running these commands, your data will be continuously archived from your source Postgres server into Iceberg in S3. You can then run fast analytical queries directly from Crunchy Data Warehouse, which uses a combination of parallel, vectorized query processing and file caching to speed up queries. You can additionally set up (materialized) views and assign read permissions to the relevant users.No complex ETL pipelines required.To give you a sense of the performance benefit of using Parquet, we loaded 100M rows into the source table, which got automatically mirrored in Parquet and Iceberg via our pipelines. We then ran a simple analytical query on each table:select device_id, avg(sensor_1) from events group by 1;
The runtimes in milliseconds are shown in the following chart:In this case the source server is a standard-16 instance (4 vcpus) on Crunchy Bridge, and the warehouse is a warehouse-standard-16 instance (4 vcpus). So, using Crunchy Data Warehouse we can analyze 100M rows in well under a second on a small machine, and get >10x speedup with Iceberg.The use of compression also means the size went from 8.9GB in PostgreSQL to 1.2GB in Iceberg using object storage.With pg_parquet and pg_incremental, you can incrementally export data from PostgreSQL into Parquet in S3, and with Crunchy Data Warehouse you can process and analyze that data very quickly while still using PostgreSQL.One of the nice characteristics of the approach described in this blog is that the pipelines are fully transactional. It means that every import or export step either fully succeeds or fails and then it will be retried until it does succeed. That’s how we can create production-ready pipelines with a few simple SQL commands.Under the covers, pg_incremental keeps track of which time ranges or files have been processed. The bookkeeping happens in the same transaction as the COPY commands. So if a command fails because of an ephemeral S3 issue, the data will not end up being ingested twice or go missing. Having transactions takes away a huge amount of complexity for building reliable pipelines. There can of course be other reasons for pipeline failures that cannot be resolved through retries (e.g. changing data format), so it is still important to monitor your pipelines.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Timothee Chalamet premieres &apos;A Complete Unknown&apos; in Berlin</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32NBPRKCgXI</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/32NBPRKCgXI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:38:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Timothee Chalamet walks the red carpet for the Berlinale premiere of his Bob Dylan biopic ‘A Complete Unknown’.

From a report: The Austrian businessman Josef Kleindienst, who is building a $5 billion luxury resort complex called the Heart of Europe on six human-made islands just off the coast of Dubai, has filed a slew of what are known officially as "cancellation actions based on non-use" targeting the James Bond name. 

Under UK and EU law, if a name is trademarked against certain goods and services but the owner does not commercially exploit it in these areas for a period of at least five years then a challenge to revoke ownership of the name can be made. "He is challenging a number of UK and European Union trademark registrations for James Bond," said Mark Caddle, a partner and patent attorney at European intellectual property firm Withers & Rogers. "The basis of the European Union filings is that James Bond has not been used for the goods and services it protects, and that is likely to be the same basis of the filings in the UK."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Couples tie the knot in Times Square on Valentine&apos;s Day</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr4UsR04Ce8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Xr4UsR04Ce8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 17:19:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Love is in the air in New York's Times Square as dozens of couples participate in a mass wedding.

But for years, the valuable humus layer has been thinning. Farmers in Brandenburg are clearly feeling the effects of this on their sandy fields. Many are now taking steps to prepare their farms for the future.

Years of drought, record rainfall and failed harvests: we are becoming increasingly aware of how sensitively our environment reacts to extreme weather conditions. Farmers' livelihoods are at stake. So is the ability of consumers to afford food. 
For a few years now, agriculture that focuses solely on maximum yields has been regarded with increasing skepticism. It is becoming more and more clear just how dependent we are on healthy soils.
Brandenburg is the federal state with the worst soil quality in Germany. The already thin, fertile humus layer has been shrinking for decades. Researchers and farmers who are keen to experiment are combating these developments and looking for solutions. Priority is being given to building up the humus layer, which consists of microorganisms and fungi, as well as springtails, small worms and centipedes. 
For Lena and Philipp Adler, two young vegetable farmers, the tiny soil creatures are invaluable helpers. On their three-hectare organic farm, they rely on simple, mechanical weed control, fallow areas where the soil can recover, and diversity. Conventional farmer Mark Dümichen also does everything he can to protect soil life on his land. For years, he has not tilled the soil after the harvest and sows directly into the field. His yields have stabilized since he began to work this way.
Isabella Krause from Regionalwert AG Berlin-Brandenburg is convinced after the experiences of the last hot summers that new crops will thrive on Brandenburg's fields in the long term. She has founded a network of farmers who are promoting the cultivation of chickpeas with support from the scientific community.

The amount of energy they could manipulate is critical to grid stability. Hackers we talked to had good intentions of safeguarding cybersecurity. But what power do actors like Russia and China wield? And what can normal users do about this threat to grid stability?

What is certain is that the new American administration has a different world view to ours. One that has no regard for established rules, established partnerships and trust. We cannot change that. We have to accept that and we have to deal with it. But I am convinced that it is not in the interests of the international community for this world view to become the sole dominant paradigm. A lack of rules must not become the model for reorganizing the world, ladies and gentlemen.

I tell you frankly, as a democrat, I am concerned, very concerned, when a small entrepreneurial elite has the power, the means and the will to redefine a significant part of the rules of liberal democracy. And I am even more concerned when some of these elite make no secret of their contempt for the institutions and norms of our democracy. That worries me.

Editor's note: This is Part 6 of 6 of a study detailing attempts to optimize layer-7 load balancing. Read the rest below.We propose Laconic, which explores the potential of offloading L7 load balancing onto SmartNICs and addresses the associated challenges. In Laconic, we employ a lightweight network stack to avoid the costs of a heavy, feature-rich network stack. To minimize the cost of synchronization operations, we design lightweight synchronization mechanisms that enable higher concurrency and scalability. To further reduce the burden on the generic cores on the SmartNIC, we offload packet processing by effectively utilizing the hardware acceleration engines available on SmartNICs. This paper does not raise any ethical issues.[1] Broadcom PS1100R. https://www.microlandusa.com/broadcomps1100r-100gbe-nvme-pcie-storage-adapter-with-power-supplycarrier-card-serial-cable.html.\

[47] Noa Zilberman. Technical perspective: hxdp: Light and efficient packet processing offload. Communications of the ACM, 65(8):91–91, 2022.A.1 Throughput of Laconic using all coresFigure 13 shows the throughput of Laconic on BlueField-2 with seven ARM cores [1]. The BlueField-2 is equipped with 2x100Gbps ports. We enable the two ports together to further stress the processing power on the ARM cores. For the baseline of Nginx running on the commodity x86 servers, we use 2x100Gbps ports of a ConnectX-5 NIC to make the link speed the same. However, although there are 2x100Gbps ports on ConnectX-5, due to the bottleneck of PCIe 3.0 for testbed servers, only about 120 Gbps can be achieved. As shown in Figure 13, Laconic with only seven NIC cores can achieve line rate[2] for large message sizes. For small message sizes, Laconic achieves comparable performance with Nginx running on x86. BlueField-2 has wimpy ARM cores, and Nginx running on ARM performs poorly, as expected. There is a clear increase in throughput for messages larger than 1M because Laconic offloads the packet processing into the hardware engine for response messages larger than 1M. Other than the first few packets, all the remaining packets in that flow are solely processed by the hardware packet processing engine. This can mitigate the head-of-line blocking problem caused by limited processing power and also relieves the CPU resources for small or future responses. In later Section 4.4, we show experiments with varying offloading thresholds.\
Figure 14 shows the throughput of Laconic on LiquidIO3 50G NIC with 24 ARM cores. Since the LiqudIO3 can only support 50 Gbps link speed, we also cap the x86 baselines at 50 Gbps for a fair comparison of all the experiments running on LiquidIO3. Nginx on the ARM cores of the SmartNIC (bar "LIO3 Nginx") has a low throughput. The throughput plateaus at around 5 Gbps even with 24 cores. Laconic can easily reach the full NIC bandwidth with 10K response size. However, Nginx running on an x86 server needs 32 beefy cores to achieve comparable performance.[1] BlueField-2 has eight available ARM cores in total. We reserve one core for the necessary background tasks.\
[2] Since the same port on the SmartNIC receives data from both the requests of the clients and also receive the responses from the backend servers, the theoretical upper limit for the load balancer’s goodput is lower than the line rate 2x100Gbps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloud Companies Have Been Doing Load Balancing All Wrong—Here’s a Smarter Way</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/cloud-companies-have-been-doing-load-balancing-all-wrongheres-a-smarter-way?source=rss</link><author>Load Balancer</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:40:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Tianyi Cui, University of Washington (cuity@cs.washington.edu);(2) Chenxingyu Zhao, University of Washington (cxyzhao@cs.washington.edu);(3) Wei Zhang, Microsoft (wei.zhang.gbs@gmail.com);(4) Kaiyuan Zhang, University of Washington (kaiyuanz@cs.washington.edu).:::tip

Editor's note: This is Part 4 of 6 of a study detailing attempts to optimize layer-7 load balancing. Read the rest below.In this section, we conduct both microbenchmarks and end-to-end application benchmarks to understand the performance of Laconic. Specifically, we aim to answer the following three questions:\
• Can Laconic’s design provide end-to-end performance benefis compared with existing load balancers?\
• What benefits are provided by each of the individual techniques used in Laconic’s design?\
• How well does Laconic perform under real-world application workloads? We implement Laconic on both on-path and off-path SmartNICs with DPDK 21.11. We implement Laconic in about 6k lines of C++ code.\
: Our testbed consists of five x86 servers with Intel Xeon 5218 CPU and 64GB of memory. Each server is equipped with a Mellanox ConnectX-5 two-port NIC. The link speed of each individual port is 100 Gbps. We use a dedicated set of servers to host SmartNICs. The on-path SmartNIC we use is a Marvell LiquidIO 3 CN3380 with 2x50 Gbps ports. The off-path SmartNIC used in our deployment is an Nvidia BlueField-2 MBF2H516C-CECOT with 2x100 Gbps ports. An Arista DCS-7060CX switch is configured with VLAN and L4 routing. We partition the clients and servers into two different subnets, which is a common setting in actual deployment. We allocate two of the five servers as clients and the other three act as servers. The load balancer operates within the server subnet and is responsible for receiving and forwarding requests through the same NIC port. This setup, referred to as "router-on-a-stick," allows the load balancer to manage the incoming requests and distribute the requests among the backend servers. Figure 7 shows the path of a request to one of the backend servers.\
: There are multiple widely adopted L7 load balancers on the market, including Envoy [18], Nginx [15], HAProxy [24], etc. We choose Nginx as our baseline since it is widely adopted in practical deployment and provides higher performance than others [13].\
Client and backend server: wrk and wrk2 are used with customized Lua scripts as the client software. We generate a list of static files with various file sizes to responding the HTTP requests of wrk. We use the metric of requests per second (RPS) reported by wrk, and we multiply it by the file size to get the goodput measurement. Nginx is configured as the backend server software which responds to wrk requests with static files of varied file sizes.4.2 End-to-end ThroughputWe evaluate the throughput performance of Laconic on offpath BlueField-2 SmartNIC and on-path LiquidIO3 SmartNIC (Figure 8) while varying the number of cores and file sizes of wrk requests.\
 To show the processing capability of Laconic, we first evaluate the throughput on just a single core by varying the response size. Figure 8a clearly shows that the single-core performance of Laconic on BlueField-2 outperforms Nginx on x86. In this experiment, we set the threshold of offloading onto the flow processing engine as 1MB. With the help of the hardware flow processing engine, for response sizes of 16M, Laconic achieves 8.7x throughput compared with Nginx x86. As shown in Figure 8c, Laconic on LIO3 performs much better than Nginx, even though Nginx runs on a more powerful x86 core. Although LiquidIO3 does not have a hardware flow processing engine, the throughput of Laconic is still 4.5x better compared with x86 Nginx.\
 To show the scalability behavior of using multiple cores, we measure the throughput by varying the number of cores. Figure 8b shows Laconic performance on BlueField-2. While offloading the processing into a hardware engine for messages larger than 1M, we observe that throughput scales with more cores for processing large messages, which can achieve up to 150 Gbps throughput. For small messages, we don’t offload processing onto the flow processing engine. Throughput for processing small messages also can scale with more cores. In Section 4.4, we will explain more about the scalability of processing small messages and why the flow processing engine has a limited impact on its scaling. Figure 8d depicts the scalability performance for LIO3, where we see linear increases in throughput till the line rate is achieved, except for the 1KB small message flow case due to frequent connection setup and tear-down. In Appendix A.1, we show zoomed-in figures of the throughput performance with all cores.We next study Laconic performance in terms of latency as Figure 9 shows. We use wrk2 with setting a target throughput as 50% peak throughput measured in the previous experiments. In this experiment, we focus on the Laconic on BlueField-2 because Laconic on BlueField-2 achieves higher throughput performance than LiquidIO-3 according to the throughput experiments in Section 4.2.\
 Figure 9a shows average latency results with a single core. Despite our design running on BlueField-2 with higher throughput, Laconic’s latency is comparable to that of the Nginx running over x86 servers. Moreover, Laconic can achieve lower latency for processing large message sizes compared with other baselines by efficiently offloading onto the flow processing engine.\
As Figure 9b and Figure 9c show, we further zoom in to specific response sizes to plot the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of latencies for all requests. Laconic on BlueField-2 achieves lower latency when compared to Nginx running on the ARM cores or the x86 cores for both short and large response sizes, which benefit from our lightweight network stack and efficient synchronization mechanisms. Additionally, large messages are processed by the flow processing engine without much involvement of cores.\
 Figure 9d shows the average latency while Laconic uses all ARM cores on BlueField-2. Compared with using only one core, Laconic achieves lower latency with more cores. Also, in the multi-core scenario, Laconic still outperforms other baselines. In Section 4.4, we also investigate how the core scalability affects the latency by varying the number of cores.4.4 Evaluating the Benefits of Key TechniquesOffloading to Flow Processing Engine: Figure 10 shows the benefits of using a hardware flow processing engine. In this experiment, we vary the offloading threshold such that requests with response size larger than the threshold were processed by the flow processing engine, while ARM cores were used for requests with response sizes smaller than the threshold. Note that prior to fully offloading the flow processing, the initial packets are processed by the ARM cores for establishing connections and inserting flow rules.\
Figure 10a and 10b show how offloading affect the throughput. As Figure 10a shows, if we use ARM cores to process requests without offloading, it is hard to achieve high throughput even with more cores. There are two reasons for the poor scalability: 1) Memory bandwidth for SmartNIC accessing the on-board memory is limited, which is also reported in other work [30]. 2) For BlueField-2, every two cores share 1MB L2 cache, which could result in cache contention while using multiple cores [41]. Thus, the poor scalability necessitates the offloading to the flow processing engine. Figure 10b shows throughput performance while we process all sizes of requests by offloading to the flow processing engine. We find that the processing of large responses can be scaled with more cores. Because packet processing is offloaded to the flow processing engine, the ARM core is just responsible for setting up the connection and installing flow rules. Additionally, we observed that the processing of small responses does not see improvement from the packet processing engine, largely due to the overhead involved in updating flow rules. This overhead will be discussed in detail below.\
Table 2 shows the time cost for updating the flow rule in the flow processing engine. Flows can be inserted or deleted from the engine in batches. From Table 2, we can see that time cost for updating rules is not negligible for small responses, especially for updating singleton rules. The time cost of updating the rule dominates the flow completion time of small requests. This is the reason why offloading the processing of small responses, such as those less than 1KB, does not improve performance. So, in practice, we only offload the processing of large responses (e.g., >1MB) to the flow processing engine. Also, we use batching to amortize the updating cost. The batch size is determined by the flow arrival pattern.\
\
Figures 10c and 10d show how offloading affects the latency. In Figure 10c, we offload processing responses whose size is larger than 1MB. As expected, the latency of processing responses remains stable as we increase the number of cores because, after offloading, ARM cores are not used to process response packets. Figure 10d depicts the case where ARM cores process responses without offloading. In this case, it is shown that not offloading to the flow processing engine leads to lower latency when using all cores and similar performance to offloaded processing when using a single core, due to avoiding the rule update costs.\
 We next study the performance of our lightweight network stack. Table 3 shows the throughput of packet processing with our network stack. Our network stack can achieve up to 3 million packets per second (Mpps) using a single ARM core of BlueField-2. To further analyze the efficiency of the network stack, we use the perf tool to break down the ARM core utilization for operations of packet processing. Among the top-5 operations in terms of ARM core utilization, We find that the DPDK API costs up to 40% utilization, which is the internal cost of the DPDK. For other operations that are memory-intensive, they frequently execute memory allocation and population, which are bottlenecked by the memory bandwidth. From the breakdown, we can see that our network stack implementation is efficient, as it is mainly bottlenecked by the DPDK API cost and memory bandwidth.\
 We evaluate our concurrent hash table design. We measure the throughput of two basic hashtable operations, insert and lookup, with the ARM cores. As Figure 11 shows, the hash table of Laconic can achieve higher throughput than the hash table provided by the DPDK library. Also, the hash table of Laconic scales the performance well with more cores. Further, Table 3 shows that Laconic handles 3M packets/sec, a rate that is supported by our hashtable but not the other alternatives.To evaluate the performance of Laconic under a real-world workload, we adopt the workload from the CONGA work on datacenter traffic load balancing [9]. We extract the flow size distribution from their enterprise workload and use it to generate a list of files on the backend server with corresponding sizes. On the client side, we use a customized Lua script for wrk to generate the request according to the distribution.\
Figure 12a shows the throughput of Laconic with the realworld workload on BlueField-2, which only has eight ARM cores. Laconic can achieve 13.3x throughput with a single core compared to Nginx running on BlueField-2. Laconic achieves higher performance with a fewer number of cores up to 75 Gbps; however, Nginx needs more than 16 cores to achieve a similar throughput.\
Figure 12b shows Laconic performance on LiquidIO3. LIO3 has 24 ARM cores, so we perform the tests on LIO3 with up to 24 cores. We observe that Nginx on LIO3 runs at a very low throughput (5.21 Gbps). Although Nginx on x86 linearly increases the performance, it needs more than 16 cores for just 50G bandwidth. In contrast, Laconic only needs up to two ARM cores of LIO3 to match the 50G NIC bandwidth.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Tiny Chip Can Handle Internet Traffic Faster—If You Let It Do Things Its Own Way</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/this-tiny-chip-can-handle-internet-traffic-fasterif-you-let-it-do-things-its-own-way?source=rss</link><author>Load Balancer</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:39:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Tianyi Cui, University of Washington (cuity@cs.washington.edu);(2) Chenxingyu Zhao, University of Washington (cxyzhao@cs.washington.edu);(3) Wei Zhang, Microsoft (wei.zhang.gbs@gmail.com);(4) Kaiyuan Zhang, University of Washington (kaiyuanz@cs.washington.edu).:::tip
Editor's note: This is Part 3 of 6 of a study detailing attempts to optimize layer-7 load balancing. Read the rest below.3 SmartNIC-based Load BalancersLaconic is a load balancer (LB) designed for SmartNICs that effectively uses their packet-processing capabilities. Our work primarily targets L7 load balancers, but some techniques also apply to accelerating L4 load balancers as well as optimizing L7 load balancers running on traditional servers.\
In this section, we first provide some baseline characterization experiments that empirically quantify the suitability of running a traditional load balancer on NIC cores, then provide an overview of the design of Laconic before describing in detail the core techniques used by the system.3.1 Offloading to SmartNICs: Challenges and OpportunitiesWe perform characterization experiments that quantify the cost of running an unmodified load balancer on the SmartNIC and then examine the performance of hardware acceleration features on SmartNICs. We demonstrate that while SmartNICs are not a good fit for directly porting LB software written for the host, customizing the software to leverage SmartNICs’ hardware accelerators can yield significant performance gains.\
We take a stock Nginx 1.20 load-balancer and run it on both host cores and SmartNIC cores. We use an x86 server with a Xeon Gold CPU and Mellanox ConnectX-5 NIC for the host experiments. We compared the host x86 performance to the LiquidIO3 CN3380 (with 24 ARM cores @2.2GHz) and BlueField-2 (with 8 ARM A72 cores) SmartNICs. We serve static files on the backend servers using a cache-enabled Nginx to ensure the bottleneck is on the load balancer, and we use wrk [22] to generate the workload.\
Table 1 provides the throughput achieved by the different configurations, as we vary the number of cores on the process (i.e., x86 cores on the host and ARM cores on the\
SmartNICs) for two different request sizes (1KB and 1MB). When we consider single-core experiments, we observe that the x86 core is about 1.8x to 3.5x more effective than the ARM cores on the SmartNIC. As we scale the number of cores on the processor, we observe a disparity between 4x and 8x. In both SmartNICs, we observe significant scalability bottlenecks; the LiquidIO3 achieves a lower line rate with eight cores than one core while performing 1MB transfers. These experiments quantify the inefficiencies of simply running an unmodified load balancer on the SmartNIC cores, which aren’t architected to run complex LB software.\
We perform another characterization experiment related to basic packet forwarding capability. We measure the performance of a DPDK-based packet rewriting and forwarding program on all of our three platforms (i.e., host x86 cores, LiquidIO3 ARM cores, and BlueField-2 ARM cores). This benchmark simply forwards packets after swapping the MAC address fields on received packets. We consider different packet sizes and vary the number of operating cores (or queues). Figure 2 depicts the performance of our three platforms and the hardware flow processing engine of BlueField-2. In contrast to the Nginx benchmark, we observe that the disparity in packet processing performance between the three platforms is much lower, indicating that the SmartNIC cores are better suited for packet processing than the additional general-purpose computing required by Nginx. Also, we demonstrate that the flow processing engine can operate efficiently compared with using x86 cores or ARM cores to process packets. Hardware flow processing engines can entirely offload packet processing and release the capability of the generic computing cores. But, the hardware rules have limited processing capability, and there is a rule update cost\
(tens of 𝜇𝑠, more details in Section 4) to inserting and deleting rules from the flow processing engine, which limits the performance gain for processing small messages with the hardware engine. Thus, we need a hybrid design combining generic NIC cores with a hardware flow processing engine.\
In summary, SmartNIC’s ARM cores can match x86 cores for simple packet processing but are significantly worse for executing a full-featured network stack. The SmartNIC can, however, enjoy the benefits of hardware acceleration if the packet processing can be entirely performed using the flow processing engine.As observed above, unmodified L7 load balancers incur significant overheads when executed on the SmartNIC cores. The SmartNIC cores are significantly worse than the host cores for running a full-featured network stack that relies on the OS kernel to maintain channel state and provide reliable and sequenced delivery channels. We, therefore, develop a streamlined version of the load balancer that is explicitly tailored to the capabilities of SmartNICs.\
We identify three key techniques to effectively use SmartNICs: lightweight network stack, lightweight synchronization for shared data structures, and hardware-accelerated packet processing. The first two techniques streamline the packet-processing logic performed by the load balancers. The third technique takes advantage of hardware flow processing engines available on SmartNICs for accelerating packet processing and rewriting. Figure 3 shows how Laconic integrates the three techniques.\
Lightweight network stack: To avoid the costs associated with the use of a full-featured network stack, we consider an alternate design that utilizes a lightweight packet forwarding stack on the LB and relies on the end-hosts themselves to achieve the desired end-to-end properties. We co-design the application layer load-balancing functions with a streamlined transport layer. Only a subset of the packets have their payloads inspected and modified by the application layer (e.g., client HTTP request packets and HTTP headers on server responses), and the LB’s transport layer is responsible for reliable delivery only for this subset. Laconic relies on the TCP stacks at the server and the client to provide reliability, sequencing, and congestion control for the remaining packets; it performs simple transformations to the packet headers, without needing access to their payloads, to transfer these responsibilities.\
Lightweight synchronization for shared data structures: As we streamline the processing logic, the synchronization costs for concurrent access to shared data structures would limit performance. These synchronization costs are incurred when different cores on a SmartNIC handle a flow’s packets. (On-path SmartNICs eschew using RSS to spread packets across cores evenly. Even when RSS is available, say on off-path SmartNICs, the packets associated with the two different flow directions of a given client-server connection will be handled on different SmartNIC cores.) We, therefore, design highly concurrent connection table management mechanisms for load balancers. We use the semantics of the shared data and the context in which the data structures are accessed to optimize the concurrency control. For instance, some elements of the connection table are initialized during connection setup and never mutated afterward. Other elements, like the expiry timestamp for connection table entries, can benefit from relaxed update semantics.\
Acceleration with Hardware Engine: Our design considers the flow processing engine on off-path SmartNICs as a packet-processing accelerator on which we can offload the load-balancing logic. This allows us to perform the commoncase packet rewriting logic on the hardware accelerators, thus reducing the packet processing burden on the generic ARM cores. However, these hardware accelerators cannot be used for all flows, as adding or removing match-action rules incurs moderate latency and is throughput limited. Laconic uses hardware acceleration only for sufficiently large flows. Laconic also relies on the general-purpose cores to perform packet rewriting while rules are being added and hides the latency of rule deletions with the connection establishment phases of subsequent flows.3.3 Lightweight Network StackOur description focuses on two crucial functionalities of L7 load balancers, as these motivate the processing performed by the load balancer and its associated state.\
 An L7 load balancer can be configured to route an HTTP request by parsing the fields in the HTTP header, such as the URL prefix. L7 load balancers buffer the entire HTTP header and then identify the backend using configured match rules.\
 L7 load balancers update HTTP header requests and responses by adding specific header values. For example, headers protect against XSS or CSRF attacks. Another common usage is to insert the client’s IP address into the request header or a server identifier into a response cookie to enable a consistent level of service per client.\
Laconic’s approach to packet processing is designed to be lightweight. Laconic utilizes a simple forwarding agent that constructs only the necessary packet content to make routing decisions and only buffers modified packet content. In particular, Laconic buffers and processes packets from the client that corresponds to the HTTP requests identifies the appropriate backend servers, and ensures the reliable delivery of these (potentially modified) packets to the server. For packets sent by the server to the client, Laconic performs some simple packet rewriting using a limited amount of state. Crucially, Laconic depends on the client to keep track of which packets it has received, and it modifies ACKs from the client to inform the server about which packets need to be retransmitted. Laconic thus does not maintain any state for these packets, and it relies on client/server TCP logic for reliable end-to-end delivery and congestion control. Figure 4 shows the overall packet flow of our network stack.\
 Each table entry in the connection table maintains a state machine representation of a connection. The connection state is one of the following.\
FRONTESTABLISHED: the client has created a TCP connection with the load balancer, but a backend has not been determined; SYNSENT: The backend has been identified, but the connection hasn’t yet been fully set up; and ESTABLISHED: the connection to the backend has been set up.\
Laconic also maintains a shallow buffer for each connection to buffer the packets received before the backend connection is established. The forwarding agent requires this buffer to construct the HTTP headers and parse information, such as the URL associated with the request.\
At its core, the forwarding agent bridges two TCP connections and simply relays packets after appropriately rewriting the packet and ACK sequence numbers. The forwarding agent has to maintain the mapping between the sequence number spaces of the two connections. Since the load balancer can insert new header fields that will change the sequence number mappings, we maintain an array of insertion points. Each insertion point records two pieces of information: the data offset where content is inserted and the size of the inserted data. For each packet, the load balancer performs a linear scan through the array, computes the total amount of inserted data before the packet, and uses this size value as an offset to adjust the sequence and ACK numbers.\
 Figure 5 demonstrates the entire connection establishment workflow.\
 The load balancer sends an SYNACK packet with a sequence number chosen according to the SYN cookie and the same TCP options as backend servers.\
 Laconic buffers the packets received from the client till it can determine a backend. In particular, the load balancer will buffer client packets until it can reconstruct and parse the header fields, e.g., the hostname and the request URL. A connection table entry is created when the first client packet with payload is received.\
Backend connection setup: After the load balancer has received sufficient client data (e.g., DATA1 in Figure 5), it can determine the backend. It then sends an SYN to the backend and completes the three-way handshake. Laconic records the sequence and ACK numbers in the connection table and then forwards the buffered client packets to the backend server, possibly after modifying any desired header. If the headers were modified, the forwarding agent holds on to the buffers until it receives the ACKs from the server; or else it releases them immediately. In the latter case, it will pass along duplicated ACKs to the client, which will then retransmit the data.\
 From this point, the connections to the client and the backend server are established and bridged. The subsequent packets will be forwarded directly without any buffering, as we will discuss next.\
3.3.3 Packet processing We discuss how the forwarding agent relays packets by appropriately modifying the sequence and ACK numbers. With HTTP 1.1 [17], a persistent connection can convey multiple HTTP requests over the same TCP connection. As a result, content insertion or modification at different points of a TCP flow is required to support the modification of multiple requests.\
Figure 6 shows an example of a TCP connection handled by the load balancer. The sender sends a sequence of requests over multiple packets resulting in a flow of size 1500 bytes to the receiver. Laconic determines two locations where we need to perform content insertions. For simplicity, we designate the sequence number space starting from zero. The insertion locations are at 100B and 1000B (where "B" stands for bytes) when viewed from the sender side and at 100B and 1100B when viewed from the receiver.\
When the load balancer performs an insert, it records the insertion point’s sequence number in the flow’s entire sequence space, as viewed by the sender and the receiver. Further, it splits the original packet at the insertion point and transmits the original packet fragments and the inserted content as separate packets.\
Laconic appropriately rewrites the ACK numbers in the presence of multiple insertions and handles retransmissions of inserted data. There are several cases to consider. If the receiver’s ACK is far beyond the inserted location (i.e., if the ACK number is higher than 1200 +𝑀𝑇𝑈 in our example), we simply use the last offset stored in the connection table and rewrite the ACK using this offset. If the ACK is between two insertion points (i.e., it is in the range of (201 + 𝑀𝑇𝑈 , 1100) in our example), we use the offset of the previous insertion point to calculate the ACK sent to the sender. If the ACK number is exactly at an insertion point and if multiple such duplicate ACKs have been received, then the load balancer retransmits the inserted content. The last case is that the ACK number is exactly after an insertion point (e.g., 201 or 1201 in our example), in which case we suppress the ACK instead of relaying it and triggering duplicate ACK processing on the sender. In the case of packets containing SACKs (selective acknowledgments), Laconic performs the ACK number transformations on every SACK block.\
ACK packets are also used as the signal to garbage collect all the buffers buffered at the load balancer. The load balancer will check the ACKs against the stored buffers and release those that have been ACKed.\
Note that the ACK number transformations ensure that the sender can use duplicate ACKs to detect and retransmit lost packets. The forwarding agent is responsible for the reliable delivery of only the inserted content, with the sender responsible for the reliability of all other content.3.4 Lightweight synchronization for shared dataWe now present the design of efficient synchronization for the load balancer’s data structures, e.g., the connection table. Ideally, we would employ a scheme such as receive-side scaling (RSS), which would allow each NIC core to have exclusive and lock-free access to its shard and avoid sharing data structures across NIC cores. This is hard in the context of both L4 and L7 LBs, as the connection table state would be accessed by traffic from both directions, and RSS would inevitably map the forward and reverse directions to different cores. Thus, Laconic’s connection table needs to provide good scalability with concurrent accesses of per-flow states from multiple NIC cores.\
The load balancer records the states of each flow in a connection table, which is used to select a backend server and update the IP and port attributes in a packet header. At a high level, the flow state recorded by Laconic in the connection table could be categorized into three kinds:\
• Decision of the backend server assignment.\
• Timeout information of connection.\
• TCP state and seq/ack number mapping.\
For each category of state, Laconic uses different strategies in the design of the connection table to accommodate its access pattern.\
 Once the backend is chosen for a specific client connection, the assignment will stick to the connection through its lifetime, meaning that the vast majority of accesses to this state would be read-only. Therefore, Laconic chooses to design its connection table based on Cuckoo hashing [33], which provides predictable and constant-time lookups. Cuckoo hashing achieves this property by limiting an entry’s position to two hashed locations within the table, but it might have to periodically shuffle the entries to accommodate new insertions. We now discuss how we can eliminate the use of locks during the lookup and still achieve correctness. For read operations, Laconic uses a version-counter-based approach to prevent the lookup operations from reading concurrent write operations: before and after Laconic reads the hash table slot with a matching key, a version counter is read from the table entry. A mismatched version number indicates that a concurrent write has been performed on the entry, in which case Laconic will retry the read operation. With this approach, no lock is held during a lookup operation to the connection table. To further improve concurrency, Laconic’s connection table adopts the optimistic locking scheme in [33] to reduce the critical section during entry shuffles triggered by inserts and minimize the amount of time a write operation needs to hold locks.\
 Tracking the last access time of each flow is important for Laconic to correctly time out and remove entries of old flows and reclaim its resources. However, recording the access time for the per-flow state could impact scalability. This is because the entry needs to be updated for every access, effectively making every single access a concurrent update, typically performed while holding a lock. To mitigate the potential inefficiencies caused by such implicit writes, Laconic uses a “blind write” to update the timestamp during the lookup operation. If a later version number check reveals that the record has been updated and is now storing state for a different flow, Laconic will not attempt to revert the update and simply retries the timestamp update. With this approach, Laconic could spuriously update the TTL of a different record, thereby delaying its garbage collection, but it also ensures that a received packet would always bump up the corresponding flow’s TTL.\
TCP state and seq/ack number mapping: For L7 load balancing, Laconic needs to maintain the TCP state (LISTEN, SYN-SENT, ESTABLISHED, etc.) and the mapping of seq/ack number between the client side and server side. However, with the help of RSS, state transitions of the TCP state machine of a single connection will always be performed on the same NIC core. Therefore, Laconic updates the state machine without acquiring any locks. We observe that the access of the seq/ack number mapping follows a consumer/producer pattern, so we use lock-free mechanisms for appending to and reading from this list.3.5 Acceleration with Hardware Engine3.5.1 Capabilities of Flow Processing Engine On offpath SmartNICs, the hardware flow processing engine can significantly accelerate packet processing. Conceptually, it works similarly as a switch with the Reconfigurable MatchAction Table (RMT) architecture. Multiple match-action tables can exist in the hardware, and match-action rules for various packet fields of a packet can be inserted dynamically. We now describe how Laconic can take advantage of these capabilities. We describe two key constructs available in flow processing engines that together aid in offloading packet-processing logic.\
 For NICs equipped with the flow processing engine, DPDK provides a RTE_FLOW interface to insert and delete rules into the NIC. These rules have two fields: a match field and an action field.\
For the match field, the application can specify fields from packet headers to match against, such as IP/MAC address and TCP/UDP port numbers. This allows the application to match packets with specific values for those fields.\
For the action field, applications can specify two types. The first type is fate actions, which determines the packet’s final destination, such as dropping it or moving it to a different queue. The second type includes non-fate actions such as packet counting and rewriting headers, including TCP port, IP address, and sequence numbers. Header updates can change a specific field or add a predetermined constant value. The flow processing engine can also set an expiry time for a rule and notify the application if no packet matches the rule after a certain time.\
 Hairpin queue is a feature first introduced in DPDK 19.11 [12]. It is similar to a loopback interface, but it operates on the network-facing ports of the NIC. The hairpin queues are a pair of connected RX and TX queues.\
: With a combination of on-NIC rules and hairpin queues, we can dramatically reduce the involvement of general-purpose cores in the load-balancing datapath. Specifically, if we were to insert rules to match packets with known flows, specify the appropriate actions to rewrite the packet contents (e.g., the sequence number and ACK number fields), and send it out through a hairpin queue, then most of the packet-processing logic of our network stack can be offloaded to the NIC flow processing engine. Furthermore, latency can be improved since all the forwarding data path is inside the NIC pipeline and bypass computing cores.\
: However, there are two types of challenges for utilizing the flow processing engine.\
The first type is a functional challenge: current SmartNICs do not support a range match operation, which would be useful in the context of Laconic for matching a range of sequence numbers. And the match-action rule can not be performed on the selective acknowledgment (SACK) blocks in the case where a receiver is signaling holes in the received sequence number space.\
The second type is a performance-related challenge: rule insertions and deletions can both be expensive in terms of latency. On the BlueField-2, the cost of a non-blocking rule insertion with batching is 25 microseconds in our tests, whereas the cost of a blocking rule insertion is substantially higher at 305 microseconds. These measurements indicate that rule updates should be performed sparingly, especially in the context of short flows, and that rule insertion costs should be overlapped with other tasks, through the use of non-blocking rule insertions.\
3.5.2 Using Flow Processing Engine We now describe how Laconic uses the flow processing engines.\
What functionalities to offload? We first note that the flow processing engines do not have advanced parsing capabilities. Therefore, request processing logic that operates on content sent from the client to the server (e.g., parsing HTTP headers, requests, etc.) is not offloaded but rather performed on a SmartNIC ARM core.\
Finally, for these offloaded flows, packet rewriting is performed only on packets sent from the server to the client; packets sent from the client to the server, which is a small portion of the traffic load, are handled on the SmartNIC ARM cores. We made this choice based on the limitation that Bluefield-2 cannot rewrite the SACK option in TCP headers. We also observed by experiment that disabling SACK incurs a dramatic loss in TCP flow performance.\
 We now describe the life cycle of flow rules from insertion to deletion. Once a server response exceeds the size threshold, a general-purpose core inserts a rule to match and modify packets sent from the server to the client. This rule matches the TCP 5-tuple corresponding to the server-to-load balancer connection, with the action of updating the sequence and ACK numbers associated with the packet using the correct offsets. This rule insertion is performed using a non-blocking operation so as to reduce the overhead associated with performing the operation. Due to the non-blocking operation, subsequent packets from the server could still be sent to a generic ARM core if the insertion hasn’t been completed, but correctness is ensured as both the ARM core and the flow processing engine are performing the same operation.\
To delete the rules, the SmartNIC cores continuously check the client ACKs as to whether the entire server response has been received or not. ACK packets from clients are continued to be handled by ARM cores instead of the flow processing engines. If the entire response has been received, then the SmartNIC core initiates the process of removing the packet update rule in preparation for having a clean connection for the next client request. The rule deletion operations are first conveyed to a dedicated core, which batches outstanding rule deletions and then performs them synchronously. By delegating this to a dedicated thread and batching such operations, we reduce the overhead of blocking rule updates. Finally, when the next client request is received, the receiving core first checks (and possibly waits) for the condition that the prior rule associated with the connection has been removed before processing the client request.\
Achieve RSS with the engine: We implement a custom RSS using the engine, which greatly simplified the need for handling concurrent access to shared data structures from different cores. Traditional RSS that operates on a flow’s 5-tuple is insufficient as the client to LB, and the server to LB segments correspond to different 5-tuples, and RSS would steer the packets received from the two directions into two different cores. Thus in Section 3.4, we propose lightweight synchronization for shared data. We can eliminate the synchronization mechanisms if packets from a given client-server connection are processed by the same core in either direction of the packet flow.\
Specifically, we pre-install a set of rules to steer incoming packets to cores solely based on the port numbers in the TCP header. We partition the port number space into multiple shards and assign each shard to a processing core. We insert a rule into the flow processing engine for each allocated TCP port number so that client packets with the source port number and server packets with the destination port number are sent to the assigned core. This ensures that packets from the same client-server connection are always processed by the same core. By doing so, we can eliminate the need for synchronization in accessing the flow table, and each core can have its own shard of the connection table. Note that this method is only needed for short flows whose packet processing is not offloaded to the engine, which also helps avoid load imbalance issues that may occur when processing large elephant flows using the same NIC core.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tiny Chips Could Quietly Replace Expensive Cloud Hardware</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tiny-chips-could-quietly-replace-expensive-cloud-hardware?source=rss</link><author>Load Balancer</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:39:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Tianyi Cui, University of Washington (cuity@cs.washington.edu);(2) Chenxingyu Zhao, University of Washington (cxyzhao@cs.washington.edu);(3) Wei Zhang, Microsoft (wei.zhang.gbs@gmail.com);(4) Kaiyuan Zhang, University of Washington (kaiyuanz@cs.washington.edu).:::tip
Editor's note: This is Part 2 of 6 of a study detailing attempts to optimize layer-7 load balancing. Read the rest below.This section discusses the structure, connectivity, and performance of programmable multi-core SmartNICs that are commonly available. We also describe the load-balancing functionality we want to deploy on these SmartNICs.2.1 Programmable Multi-core SmartNICsWe consider programmable SmartNICs equipped with multicore processors. A typical SmartNIC has onboard memory, DMA engines, and accelerators (e.g., engines for crypto, compression, and packet rewriting) in addition to the multi-core processor. Below, we discuss the two dominant categories, on-path and off-path SmartNICs [35].\
 These are SmartNICs where the NIC processing cores are on the data path between the network port and the host processor (see Figure 1). Consequently, every packet received or transmitted by the host is also processed by the NIC cores. The performance of the NIC cores is critical to the throughput and latency characteristics of the NIC. To address this issue, these NICs typically augment the traditionally wimpy cores on the SmartNIC with specialized hardware support that enhances the packet-processing capabilities of the core. For example, packet contents are prefetched and placed in a structure similar to the L1 cache, and there are hardware mechanisms for managing packet buffers. The SmartNIC has hardware mechanisms for delivering incoming packets to NIC cores in a balanced manner, but there are no mechanisms, such as receive side scaling (RSS), to deliver specific packets to specific NIC cores. Further, the NIC cores can invoke specialized accelerators for tasks such as crypto and compression. Marvell LiquidIO [37] and Netronome NICs [40] are on-path SmartNICs.\
 These are SmartNICs where the NIC’s processing cores are off the data path connecting the host to the network. A NIC-level switching fabric, a NIC switch, provides connectivity between the network port, the host cores, and the NIC cores. The NIC switch is a specialized hardware unit with match-action engines for selecting packet fields and rewriting them based on runtime-configurable rules. The rules route packets received from the network to the host or the NIC, or rewrite them and immediately transmit them back into the network. Mellanox Bluefield [41] and Broadcom Stingray [10] are off-path SmartNICs.\
The off-path SmartNICs thus contain both general-purpose cores and packet match-action engines. The packet-processing logic could thus be split across the cores and the match-action engines based on the complexity of the logic. For instance, the cores can perform complex packet processing and delegate to the match-action engines simpler operations such as packet steering, header-rewriting, and packet forwarding.\
 Datacenter operators are increasingly resorting to offloading various infrastructure functions to SmartNICs and reducing the usage of host cores, which can, in turn, then be rented out and monetized. The ARM cores on SmartNICs are not as powerful as the host x86 cores, but they are an order of magnitude less expensive and result in substantial cost savings [3, 6]. Network virtualization, security, and storage are some of the typical operations offloaded to SmartNICs, and in this work, we seek to expand this to include the infrastructure’s load-balancing function.\
We seek to offload our load-balancing capability on both on-path and off-path load balancers. Others have noted that the communication latencies between the SmartNIC cores and the host cores can be significant in the case of off-path SmartNICs [35], so we target complete offloads for both types of SmartNICs, i.e., all load balancing logic is performed on the SmartNIC cores. Further, this allows us to target even headless SmartNICs with an independent power supply and a carrier card, allowing for a host-less solution (e.g., Broadcom Stingray PS1100R [1]) and enabling substantial reductions to both hardware and operating costs.Load balancers operating at different network layers are widely deployed inside data centers to deliver traffic to services. They fall into two categories: Layer 4 and Layer 7.\
An L4 load balancer maps a virtual IP address (VIP) to a list of backend servers, with each server having its own dynamic IP address (DIP). As the L4 load balancers operate on the transport layer, the routing decision is solely based on the packet headers of the transport/IP layers (i.e., the 5-tuple of IP addresses and ports) but not the payload. Several L4 load balancers are deployed by cloud providers [14, 16, 43]).\
L7 load balancers are significantly more complex and operate on content at the application layer (e.g., HTTP data). Many services inside a data center may share a common application gateway implementing the L7 load-balancing functionality. The L7 load balancer dispatches requests to the corresponding backend servers based on the service requested, e.g., different services are commonly differentiated by the URL [23]. The load balancer would then reassemble the stream and match the URL against various patterns to route the request to the corresponding services.\
It is common for an L7 load balancer to modify the streamed application data, e.g., insert an x-forwarded-for header to inform the backend server of the real IP address of the client. The load balancer may also modify the reply from the server to inject a cookie into the response. Future requests from the same client can then be routed to the same backend server based on the cookie.\
Due to the complex nature and the functionality provided by the L7 load balancer, it is typically implemented as a dedicated application on top of the kernel networking stack, e.g., Nginx [15], Envoy [18], HAProxy [24]. Given the overheads of the OS’s networking stack and the application-level load balancing, the performance of L7 load balancers is an order of magnitude lower than that of L4 load balancers, with 50% to 90% of the processing time spent inside the kernel [25, 31].]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloud Giants Spend a Fortune on Load Balancers—This Research Could Change That</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/cloud-giants-spend-a-fortune-on-load-balancersthis-research-could-change-that?source=rss</link><author>Load Balancer</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:38:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Tianyi Cui, University of Washington (cuity@cs.washington.edu);(2) Chenxingyu Zhao, University of Washington (cxyzhao@cs.washington.edu);(3) Wei Zhang, Microsoft (wei.zhang.gbs@gmail.com);(4) Kaiyuan Zhang, University of Washington (kaiyuanz@cs.washington.edu).:::tip
Editor's note: This is Part 1 of 6 of a study detailing attempts to optimize layer-7 load balancing. Read the rest below.Load balancers are pervasively used inside today’s clouds to scalably distribute network requests across data center servers. Given the extensive use of load balancers and their associated operating costs, several efforts have focused on improving their efficiency by implementing Layer-4 load-balancing logic within the kernel or using hardware acceleration. This work explores whether the more complex and connection-oriented Layer-7 load-balancing capability can also benefit from hardware acceleration. In particular, we target the offloading of load-balancing capability onto programmable SmartNICs. We fully leverage the cost and energy efficiency of SmartNICs using three key ideas. First, we argue that a full and complex TCP/IP stack is not required for Layer-7 load balancers and instead propose a lightweight forwarding agent on the SmartNIC. Second, we develop connection management data structures with a high degree of concurrency with minimal synchronization when executed on multi-core SmartNICs. Finally, we describe how the load-balancing logic could be accelerated using custom packet-processing accelerators on SmartNICs. We prototype Laconic on two types of SmartNIC hardware, achieving over 150 Gbps throughput using all cores on BlueField-2, while a single SmartNIC core achieves 8.7x higher throughput and comparable latency to Nginx on a single x86 core.Load balancers are a fundamental building block for data centers as they balance the service load across collections of application servers [38, 45, 46]. Load balancers were initially built as specialized hardware appliances but are now typically deployed as software running on commodity servers or VMs. This deployment model provides a greater degree of customizability and adaptability than the older hardwarebased designs, but it also can result in high costs for cloud providers and application services, given the purchase costs and the energy consumption of general-purpose servers [8]. Application services often go to great lengths to consolidate and reduce their use of load balancers to obtain desired cost savings [2, 4, 5].\
Given the extensive use and cost of load balancers, several efforts have focused on improving their efficiency, especially Layer-4 (L4) load balancers, by embedding the load balancing logic in a lower, possibly hardware-accelerated, layer. Katran [16] is accelerated using eBPF code inside the Linux kernel, thus intercepting and processing packets within the kernel and minimizing the number of transitions to userlevel load-balancing code. ClickNP [32] tackles some aspects of the L4 load balancing logic (especially NAT-like capabilities) on an FPGA-enabled SmartNIC and exploits the parallel processing capabilities of FPGA devices. SilkRoad [38] uses a combination of a programmable switch and an end-host to store the state associated with L4 load balancers and perform the dataplane transformations related to the load-balancing operation within a switch pipeline.\
While these efforts have made considerable gains in optimizing L4 load balancing that balances traffic at the network layer, data center services often rely on application-layer load-balancing capabilities found only in Layer-7 (L7) load balancers. In particular, services would like to route flows based on the attributes of the client request, preserve session affinity for client requests, provide access control, and so on [7]. But, these features make it harder for L7 load balancers to adopt the hardware-acceleration techniques used for L4 load balancers. A fundamental challenge is that the L7 load-balancing operation is based on information embedded within connection-oriented transport protocols, thus seeming to require a full-stack network processing agent on the load balancer to handle TCP/HTTP connections. Consequently, today’s L7 load balancers are generic software solutions incurring high processing costs on commodity servers.\
In this work, we examine whether we can improve the efficiency of L7 load balancers using programmable networking hardware. We focus on SmartNICs that provide general-purpose computing cores augmented with packet-processing hardware. SmartNICs are particularly attractive targets as their compute cores can host arbitrary protocol logic while their packet-processing accelerators can perform dataplane transformations efficiently. A SmartNIC thus combines the capabilities of traditional host computing with the emerging capabilities of programmable switches and is an appropriate target for L7 load balancers. Our work is also partly motivated by the increasing deployment of SmartNICs within data centers as a cost-effective and energy-efficient computing substrate for networking tasks.\
Several challenges have to be addressed in offloading loadbalancing functionality to SmartNICs. First, SmartNIC cores are wimpy, equipped with limited memory, and inefficient at running general-purpose computations. To the extent possible, we should use lightweight network stacks instead of generic, full-functionality stacks present inside OS kernels. Second, efficient multi-core processing on the SmartNICs presumes lightweight synchronization for access to concurrent data structures, and this is particularly relevant as we slim down the network processing logic. Third, the effective use of accelerators for packet transformations is necessary to enhance the computing capability of SmartNICs.\
We design and implement , a SmartNIC-offloaded load balancer that addresses the challenges raised above. A key component of our system is a lightweight network stack that represents a co-design of the application-layer load-balancing logic with the transport layer tasks. This lightweight network stack performs complex packet processing only on a subset of the packets transmitted through the load balancer. For the rest of the packets, the network stack performs simple rewriting of packets and relies on the client and the server to provide end-to-end reliability and congestion control. For SmartNICs with packet-processing accelerators, this design allows most of the packets to be processed using hardware-based flow-processing engines, thus providing significant efficiency gains. We also develop connection management data structures that are highly concurrent and minimize expensive mutual exclusion operations. We note that some of our design contributions also apply to a generic server-based design, but they have a multiplicative effect on SmartNICs by factoring out a fast path that can be executed on the hardware packet engines.\
We built Laconic and tailored it to two different types of SmartNICs: Marvell LiquidIO3 and Nvidia BlueField-2. Laconic provides both Layer-4 and Layer-7 functionality and implements commonly used Layer-7 interposition logic for balancing connections to backend services. For large messages, Laconic running on BlueField-2 with one single ARM core can achieve up to 8.7x higher throughput than widely-used Nginx running on a more powerful x86 core. For small messages, Laconic on BlueField-2 can achieve higher throughput with comparable or even lower latency compared with Nginx. On LiquidIO3, the throughput of Laconic is 4.5x higher compared with x86 Nginx. We also demonstrate the Laconic performance with real-world workload and present detailed microbenchmarks on the benefits of key ideas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Military overtones ring through Mali&apos;s renowned arts festival | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DcwMKkEVP4</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3DcwMKkEVP4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Listeners swayed as the celebrated Malian duo Amadou and Mariam sang from a stage on the banks of the Niger River at an annual festival in Mali.

He was elected a fellow of the UK’s national academy of sciences in 2018 as a result of his work and impact in the space and electric vehicle industries.However, the Royal Society is under mounting pressure to revoke the honour.In August, the Guardian revealed a number of fellows had written to the Royal Society expressing concern over Musk’s comments regarding unrest in the UK and calling for him to be stripped of his fellowship.Prof Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders at the University of Oxford, subsequently resigned her fellowship because of a lack of action by the Royal Society, with Andrew Millar, a professor of systems biology at the University of Edinburgh, following suit this week, as first reported by Research Professional News.More than 1,700 members of the international scientific community have signed an open letter to the president of the Royal Society, Sir Adrian Smith, with signatories including Bishop, Sir Richard Peto – an eminent statistician and Royal Society fellow – and Prof Susan Michie of UCL, a behavioural scientist who became a household name during the Covid pandemic.Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, said he was motivated to write the letter out of frustration at the organisation’s continued silence.“This isn’t an HR complaint about harassment or bullying or anything like that. This is a matter of behaviour that is entirely public,” he said. “Everybody can see what Musk has said and what he’s doing as head of Doge, and the Royal Society, which claims to have a strong voice for science within the UK, but actually, even on the international stage, has said absolutely nothing.”The letter notes the Royal Society was made aware of fellows’ concerns more than six months ago, and that since then Musk has made further incendiary comments.These include calling the MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”. Phillips has said the comments made her more worried about her safety.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry writes.The letter states the situation is rendered more serious because of Musk’s new position within a Trump administration that, Curry writes, “has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts”, noting that concerns have also been raised over censorship, particularly in the realm of climate scienceThe letter adds that the lack of comment by the Royal Society about Musk’s fellowship, other than its reiteration that concerns around individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence, “increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage”.Curry said he hopes the letter, as well as the recent resignations, would highlight to the Royal Society the breadth and depth of feeling within the scientific community about Musk’s fellowship.“If they believe at all in the values that they espouse in their code of conduct, then they really have to come out and explain to people why is it that they think that Musk’s behaviour is consistent with [them],” he said.The Guardian understands there is to be a meeting of the Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 March to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.A spokesperson for the Royal Society said: “In the event of any concerns raised about the behaviour of a fellow, the Society has a clear set of processes described in our code of conduct, which is published on our website along with relevant disciplinary regulations. Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.’’]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Berlin Film Festival 2025 LIVE: Timothée Chalamet walks red carpet</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc89NQn-N2A</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fc89NQn-N2A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:22:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as  Timothée Chalamet brings Oscar nominated film “A Complete Unknown” to Germany for a special screening during the Berlin Film Festival.

With tools like OpenAI’s Operator, Anthropic’s Computer Use API, and BrowserBase’s Open Operator, these agents can navigate the web, mimic real users, and even take actions at scale. The challenge? Knowing whether they’re enhancing your user experience—or opening the door to abuse.In some scenarios, apps might encourage agent use if it improves usability and adoption, but in other cases, it could present unacceptable risks for application developers or be used as a method for malicious attacks (e.g. credential stuffing or fake account creation).In either scenario, observability is paramount. Applications need to know what traffic is on their site (is this a human? A bot? A good bot or a bad one?) in order to make intelligent decisions about how to shape traffic and enforce desired usage patterns. AI agents add an additional wrinkle as users are already sharing their credentials with tools like Operator, meaning even a well-intentioned agent creates potential risk for these applications and their users.The key question is: Can you detect AI agent traffic on your application today?We tested multiple AI agent toolkits across high-traffic consumer sites, and the results were clear—legacy detection techniques (CAPTCHAs, IP blocking, user-agent filtering) are largely ineffective. Here’s what we found.The New Reality of Bot Traffic:What AI Agent Traffic Looks LikeTraditionally, bot detection relied on CAPTCHAs, IP blocking, and user-agent filtering. But modern AI agents are engineered to look like actual users: They use genuine IP addresses, user agents, and even simulate mouse movements.Headless browsing at human speeds: Their interactions mimic natural browsing behavior, evading rate-limit triggers.Datacenter origins—but not always: While some (like OpenAI’s Operator) come from known Azure datacenters, others (like Anthropic’s API) can run locally, borrowing your machine’s properties.On the surface level, AI agent traffic can look quite similar to regular human user traffic. Here are examples of browser & network properties across different AI agents:Anthropic Computer Use APIBrowserBase Open OperatorChrome on Linux (standard fingerprint)Firefox on Ubuntu (stable, unless run locally)Chrome on Mac (with stealth features)Known Azure Datacenter IPVaries—depends on local vs. cloud deploymentSan Francisco, CaliforniaBoth OpenAI’s Operator and BrowserBase’s Open Operator spin up remote datacenter or container‑hosted Chromium instances, rather than installing any software on your local machine. Because these solutions originate from a cloud‑hosted environment (with IP addresses and other signatures tied to the provider’s infrastructure), they can be  via methods like ASN lookups if the provider’s IP ranges are well known.By contrast, Anthropic’s “Computer Use” functionality is available only through its API as of now, and you can choose how to run that API (e.g., directly on your own machine vs. inside a VM or container). If you run it locally, it inherits your local system’s properties like IP and ASN; if you host it in the cloud, it uses whichever environment that provider offers. Each approach has its own implications for fingerprinting and detection.Currently, Anthropic provides two options for using their agent:Direct use of your computer environment (not recommended due to security concerns around unrestricted access).Setting up a virtual machine or container with minimal privileges to run the API. You can either run this locally or deploy to a cloud provider using Docker, in which case it won’t inherit the user’s network properties.Whereas stricter sites like Reddit block OpenAI and BrowserBase outright, Anthropic’s approach allows it to successfully bypass even these strict sites when run locally:And with tools like BrowserBase, there are also now open-sourced options for building browsing AI agents that allow potential attackers to increase the stealth of their headless browsing setup. This means we should expect continued, quick iteration on some agent use cases that will make them even more difficult to detect. As an example, BrowserBase offers premium plans with more advanced stealth to bypass CAPTCHA and other detection techniques:Today, most sites are allowing agent traffic to navigate freely – whether these sites are detecting the abnormalities of this traffic (and choosing not to take action) is hard to say. For some like Reddit & Youtube, their block on OpenAI Operator indicates they want to lock down agentic traffic. When these AI Agents bypass their restrictions (as detailed below), it’s a good signal those tools are actually flying below their radar today versus being officially sanctioned.For others that allow this traffic, they may actually encourage it for user convenience or potentially have perverse incentives in some cases to allow a certain amount of bot traffic (Ticketmaster is a potential example of this given they can benefit from some level of bot activity increasing ticket purchase rates). Many more sites, however, simply don’t have the traffic intelligence to detect these AI agents, which explains why they can operate freely.In testing the three primary AI Agent browsing toolkits on a set of high traffic consumer sites, we found that Youtube and Reddit were the only ones that consistently blocked this traffic:Anthropic Computer Use APIBrowserBase Open OperatorFew websites are blocking popular AI Agents today – indicating either a lack of detection, ambivalence towards enforcement, or both. Reddit & Youtube are a couple of key outliers that block this traffic when they can discern it.Still, the differences are interesting. It’s worth understanding why Anthropic or BrowserBase are sometimes able to bypass sites that otherwise are blocking this traffic. In BrowserBase’s case, they generate a slightly different user-agent each session, which sometimes aligns with the underlying chromium runtime but sometimes attempts to be deceptive by claiming to be a different version, which leads to more inconsistency in whether companies detect it correctly.Companies like LinkedIn and X are particularly sensitive to scraping on their sites, so the lack of enforcement is surprising. This suggests they’re not currently able to confidently discern this is programmatic traffic.How to Tell an Agent from a HumanThe obvious question here is: shouldn't this be easy to detect by using just an IP or user agent?And the answer is yes and no. For OpenAI Operator, it’s pretty straightforward to detect given its stability & origin point. For Anthropic and BrowserBase (and the new agents entering the market), it’s a bit more complicated.Anthropic Computer Use APIBrowserBase Open OperatorDepends on how you run it:Unlike Operator, you can run it locally directly on your machine or (recommended) on a dockerized container. In this case, it inherits your own device’s IP & characteristicsIn production, you’d likely host it in AWS/Azure/etc and traffic would come from known data centersOffers options for automatically solvingSome key elements worth knowing:OpenAI & BrowserBase both operate on top of chromium – being able to discern chromium browsers vs. true chrome is key for detecting the latter since BrowserBase modifies things like IP, user agent, etc for increased stealth.OpenAI originates out of a known Azure datacenter while BrowserBase originates from a known AWS datacenter.OpenAI hands off non-invisible CAPTCHAs to the end user to complete, while BrowserBase offers options for automatically solving.Ideally, you want to detect this traffic beyond more coarse identifiers like known datacenter IPs so that your detection is fully resistant to adjustments agentic traffic will make in the future. And core to that is having high confidence in whether a browser interacting with your site is a real browser or a headless instrumentation.This is where we’ve personally found Machine Learning to be incredibly useful by building a browser lie detector. We look at a very wide range of browser signals & we have downloaded the entire historical archives of every browser version that has been released that we can find and trained our model on what authentic browsers look like vs. anomalous or deceitful browsers. To provide this visibility, we’ve automated additions of new legitimate browser signatures upon new releases, we fingerprint it, run it past the model to establish an authentic set of signals for the current browser version, allowing us to detect anyone trying to emulate that version inorganically. With that fingerprinted dataset, machine learning can be used to detect anomalies with high accuracy. It’s this signal collection that has allowed us to see that OpenAI & BrowserBase are full chromium builds, while Anthropic’s Firefox browser fails to emulate certain characteristics that would be present on a real user’s Firefox instance.Charting Your Path ForwardWhether you choose to block, restrict, or harness AI agent traffic, effective observability is non-negotiable. Here’s our current playbook: Start by detecting and monitoring AI agent fingerprints. Learn from their behavior before enforcing hard limits.Embrace legitimate use cases: Some users may leverage AI agents to streamline workflows (e.g., automating reporting on your dashboard). Recognize these opportunities while safeguarding against abuse. As AI agents evolve, so must your detection strategies. Invest in ML-based solutions that adapt alongside new agent behaviors.AI agents are rewriting the rules of web interaction. They offer exciting UX advancements—but also present new security challenges. The race is on: evolve your detection or risk being outpaced by bad actors and unintended misuse.Try Device Fingerprinting99.99% bot detection, intelligent rate limiting, and reverse engineering protection.Read the docs]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m very impressed by how Rust supports both beginners and pro&apos;s</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ipe6m7/im_very_impressed_by_how_rust_supports_both/</link><author>/u/ConstructionShot2026</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:16:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I would go as far saying it supports a syntax abstraction that is simpler than python to read.I just find it amazing, with a performance level so close to C++.Its your choice how many complex features you want to add for control and optimization, and the compiler is so cool, that it can add them automatically if I don't see it necessary.I believe if more knew how simple it could be, more would use it outside systems programming :D]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Live: Munich Security Conference 2025 - Day 2 | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8XBKP4gCa0</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J8XBKP4gCa0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:08:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Planned Schedule:

We should expect to observe that the universe in which we live must conform to the conditions required for our presence as observers. This is the unremarkable “Weak Anthropic Principle”: our universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life. The “Strong Anthropic Principle” makes the teleological claim that the universe must have those properties that allow or require intelligent life to develop, that the universe is in some sense compelled to bring forth conscious life. Does anything meaningful follow from these ideas?

To establish the endpoint, we’ll use the Neptune cluster’s API and the model artifacts stored in S3. With the endpoint live, we’ll query it for link prediction, using a Gremlin query to identify high-confidence potential connections in our graph.\
By now, we have already loaded the Twitch social networking data into the Neptune cluster (as described in Part 1 of this series), exported the data using the ML profile (check out Part 2 for details), preprocessed the data (as explained in Part 3), trained the model (see Part 4), and now we're ready to use the trained model to generate predictions.Let's create the inference endpoint using the cluster's API and the model artifacts we have in S3. As usual, we need an IAM role that has access to S3 and SageMaker first. The role must also have a trust policy that allows us to add it to the Neptune cluster (the trust policy can be found in Part 3 of this guide). We also need to provide access to SageMaker and CloudWatch API from inside the VPC, so we need the VPC endpoints as explained in Part 1 of this series.\
Let's use the cluster's API to create an inference endpoint with this curl command:curl -XPOST https://(YOUR_NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT):8182/ml/endpoints \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "mlModelTrainingJobId": YOUR_MODEL_TRAINING_JOB_ID,
    "neptuneIamRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NeptuneMLNeptuneRole"
      }'
We can use '' and '' parameters to choose the EC2 instance type that will be used for link prediction, and deploy more than one instance. The full list of parameters can be found here. We'll use the default '' instance as it has enough CPU and RAM for our small graph, and this instance type was recommended in inferrecommendation.json that was generated after model training in our previous stage:{
    "disk_size": 12023356,
    "instance": "ml.m5d.xlarge",
    "mem_size": 13847612
}
The API responds with the inference endpoint ID:{"id":"b217165b-7780-4e73-9d8a-5b6f7cfef9f6"}
Then we can check the status of the inference endpoint with this command:curl https://YOUR_NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT:8182/ml/endpoints/INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_ID?neptuneIamRole='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NeptuneMLNeptuneRole'
and once it responds with '' like this,{
  "endpoint": {
    "name": "YOUR_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_NAME-endpoint",
    "arn": "...",
    "status": "InService"
  },
  "endpointConfig": {...},
  "id": "YOUR_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_ID",
  "status": "InService"
}
it means we're ready to start using it with database queries.The endpoint can also be viewed and managed from the AWS console, under SageMaker -> Inference -> Endpoints.Let's use the endpoint to predict new 'follow' links in the graph. In order to do that, we need to choose the source vertex of the possible new links.It helps if the source vertex already has links, so we’ll use this query to get the vertex with the highest number of existing links (outE and inE connections):g.V()
 .group()
   .by()
   .by(bothE().count())
 .order(local)
   .by(values, Order.desc)
 .limit(local, 1)
 .next()
which means that vertex with ID = 1773 has 1440 connections (720 inE and 720 outE).To get the number of edges that start at node 1773 and the number of edges that end at that node we can use these queries:g.V('1773').outE().count()
g.V('1773').inE().count()
The same number of inE and outE connections is expected because the initial dataset contains mutual friendships, and we augmented the data with reverse edges to make it work with Neptune directed graph.\
Now let's get the predicted connections. To do that, we'll run a Gremlin query with Neptune ML predicates. We'll use the inference endpoint and the SageMaker role which was added to the DB cluster to get the users that user 1773 might follow with a confidence threshold (minimum likelihood of link existence according to the model) of at least 0.1 (10%), while excluding the users that user 1773 is already following:%%gremlin

g.with('Neptune#ml.endpoint', 'YOUR_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_NAME')
 .with('Neptune#ml.iamRoleArn', 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/NeptuneMLSagemakerRole')
 .with('Neptune#ml.limit', 10000)
 .with('Neptune#ml.threshold', 0.1D)
 .V('1773')
 .out('follows')
 .with('Neptune#ml.prediction')
 .hasLabel('user')
 .not(
  __.in('follows').hasId('1773')
 )
"Result"
"v[755]"
"v[6086]"
"v[6382]"
"v[7005]"
\
According to our model, there's at least 10% chance that user 1773 will follow each of these 4 users. Perhaps we can improve the model by increasing the number of training jobs to at least to 10 as recommended by AWS, and then compare the performance of the resulting model and the predicted links. In real applications, adding user profile and activity data to the graph also improves prediction accuracy.\
Predicted connections in social networking datasets can be used to provide personalized recommendations like friend and content suggestions, enhancing user engagement and community growth, reducing churn, and providing additional data for targeted advertising.\
Although we applied link prediction to a social networking dataset, it's just one of many possible applications of this technology. From recommendation engines to network optimization, link prediction is a versatile tool that brings value by uncovering hidden relationships within data. As graph-based applications continue to expand, the potential of link prediction across industries promises new insights, efficiency, and enhanced user experiences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Call for speakers: TechCrunch All Stage 2025</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/call-for-speakers-techcrunch-all-stage-2025/</link><author>TechCrunch Events</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founders, VCs, and startup experts — this is your moment!

Imagine a child asks an AI chatbot about feeling sad. Without knowing the user's age, the AI could respond with an unnuanced discussion of depression and self-harm – content that might be appropriate for an adult but potentially harmful for a young person. While this scenario is hypothetical, it illustrates a fundamental problem with today's AI systems: they can't tailor their responses based on a user's age.  and  are addressing this critical gap with their KidRails for LLMs framework, creating AI that can respond appropriately to children.\
"Historically technology has not been designed with kids in mind - that's certainly been the case with the internet and internet connected devices - the same pattern holds for AI," says Josh Thurman, Co-Founder and Head of Product at AngelQ. "When it comes to AI these negative consequences will undoubtedly be grossly amplified without appropriate guardrails in place."\
Recent incidents highlight this concern. Cases of AI systems providing dangerously inappropriate responses to children have emerged, from  allegedly contributing to a Florida teenager's suicide in 2023 to  providing inappropriate relationship advice to users it believed to be minors. These troubling cases underscore the limitations and potential dangers of applying adult-focused technology to young users. "We're releasing KidRails as a starting point for reversing the trend of technologies that are harmful to children," says Thurman. "We have to get this right in the AI age - the stakes are extremely high."\
Understanding Child Development in AI Design"Creating truly child-safe AI requires a deep understanding of developmental psychology and education," explains Tim Estes, CEO and Co-Founder of AngelQ. "A six-year-old and an eleven-year-old don't just process information differently, they have entirely different needs, interests, and safeguards required. KidRails was engineered from the ground up to recognize these crucial differences and adjust its interactions accordingly."\
The framework employs a tiered approach that adapts responses based on a child's age and developmental stage. It can provide age-appropriate answers, offer limited responses with parental deference, or completely defer to parents for sensitive topics. As Estes notes, "Sometimes the best approach for AI is to know when not to say something."\
A Partnership Built on Shared Values\
The collaboration between AngelQ and Arcee AI emerged from aligned priorities about children's safety in technology. "Mark and I first connected at the beginning of 2024, and from our very first conversation, it was immediately apparent that we shared a fundamental belief: technology for children was very important and there was an opportunity to do innovative work in making Language Models safer and more age appropriate in their function," says Estes.\
By making KidRails open-source, the companies aim to establish new standards for child-safe AI interactions. The release includes training data, evaluation criteria, and complete processes for fine-tuning – all under the Apache 2 license. This transparency invites broader community participation in improving how AI systems interact with children.\
Addressing Core Challenges\
"The fundamental challenge in building a child-focused LLM is the decisions on what to say at different ages," Estes explains. "That's really a decision process and it's why we are open sourcing the work- because of transparency and inviting a broader community to help us improve those judgments."\
Unlike traditional approaches that add safety filters to existing models, KidRails integrates parent involvement into its core functionality. The system creates opportunities for parent-child discussions by redirecting certain questions to parents, ensuring that "AI enhances, rather than replaces, the critical role parents play in their children's development and digital literacy," says Estes.\
The development process involved carefully considering how children interact with AI systems. The team generated and curated over 250,000 child conversations to create representative training data, which was used to fine-tune a Llama 3.1 8B base model. This approach ensures responses are not only safe but also appropriate for different developmental stages."We envision KidRails as more than a tool; it's a demonstration that AI can be fundamentally reimagined with children as the primary users, setting a new precedent for the entire industry," says Estes. "We want children to be able to explore and learn in an environment that preserves the natural curiosity and wonder of childhood, while giving parents the confidence that comes from knowing their children are engaging with technology built specifically for them… not adapted adult technology with safety filters added as an afterthought."\
By making the framework open-source and encouraging collaboration, AngelQ and Arcee AI are working to transform how the industry approaches AI development for young users. As more companies adopt and build upon the KidRails framework, their vision of creating AI systems that truly prioritize children's needs moves closer to reality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Wants to End Penny Production.

In part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. 

A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time. You might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. "A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper'," he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube. 

[...] The first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? [...] Zuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A$AP Rocky trial LIVE: Closing arguments set to finish</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9mKNGsEPzQ</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/S9mKNGsEPzQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:19:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as A$AP Rocky's lawyer is expected to finish delivering his closing argument at the hip-hop star's trial, where he is charged with firing a gun at a former friend on a Hollywood street in 2021.

Economists are looking at 'creative destruction' - an 80-year-old economic concept that says products and sectors must go away or disappear to make way for newer sectors. It’s one approach to bringing Europe’s largest economy back on track, as the nature of jobs is changing and layoffs from legacy companies like Volkswagen, Porsche and ThyssenKrupp have many here worried.

Who Will Win?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tether-vs-the-us-military-who-will-win?source=rss</link><author>Mark Helfman</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:01:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, almost single-handedly holds the crypto market together. At $140 billion, with tentacles in all crypto apps and exchanges, it’s a big fuss. Anything that tanks Tether will tank the entire crypto market.\
Critics call it the biggest crime scene in financial history, a Ponzi scheme of unfathomable proportions, and the last bastion of terrorists, drug syndicates, and money launderers.\
USDT is a mirror image of the US dollar. A copycat. An imitation.\
It exists because most of the world can’t get “real” dollars, but they can get a digital representation of the same.The experts say that’s nonsense. The US dollar is worth something because the US government says so.\
That government has a military to enforce its laws and treaties. Aircraft carriers, for example.Experts say these things back the US dollar.\
Does that military make the US dollar better than USDT?\
You’d have to hope so, because US taxpayers spend almost $1 trillion on that military. They spend another $36 trillion on the “full faith and credit” that backs every dollar.\
Is that better than whatever Tether offers?Choose whether the statement applies to Tether, the US military, or both.\
Will collapse if the US dollar fails.\
Tether loses a profit center but has non-USD stablecoins to fall back on and can create more products if necessary. While its reserves will collapse, so will the need for reserves (because the US dollar will be worthless, therefore redeemable for nothing).\
Has never passed an audit.\
Tether has never even  an audit.\
The US military has failed all its audits. In fact, for its most recent audit, the US military passed only 7 of 29 categories and couldn’t account for 61% of its spending.\
The world order would fall apart if it disappeared.\
If Tether disappeared, people would use a different USD stablecoin.\
Responsible for the deaths of millions.\
We don’t know how many people Tether has killed. I’m guessing it’s a lot less than millions. Probably 0.\
Props up dictators and autocrats?\
The US military, for sure. We know this because it’s public information and part of US foreign policy.\
Tether? We don’t know, but you’d have to assume so. North Korea used USDT as part of its FDI-as-theft fundraising policy. Does that count? If not, we have to assume other despots used USDT for something or other.\
Responsible for the overthrow of sovereign governments?\
Tether doesn’t mess with that.That may sound absurd. Shall we look at some ways they’re alike? run by one guy who is unaccountable to the public and does whatever his boss (the President) tells him to do. run by three guys who are unaccountable to the public and do whatever their customers tell them to do. vital for the security of Western governments and their friendliest partners. vital for the liquidity of global financial networks and the people who use them. a secretive, opaque entity that does terrible things with US dollars in pursuit of US policy outcomes. a secretive, opaque entity that does terrible things with US dollars in pursuit of profits.\
Tether and the US military dominate their respective fields, get a lot of support and praise, and face withering, sometimes-valid criticism. They both expand the power, usage, and demand for US dollars.There is, however, a big difference that I didn’t cover above.\
Tether has enough money to back its token.\
The US military has no money. It gets funding from the US government, which hasn’t had enough money to back its dollars since the 20th century. Despite having the largest economy in the history of mankind, it falls $1 trillion short of its budget obligations each year. It depends on speculators, taxpayers, and central bank interventions for its solvency.\
Which one should you worry about more?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Food Network competition has only women winners</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ToUh2kcSc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n3ToUh2kcSc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Women have dominated Food Network’s “Tournament of Champions,” the only televised cooking competition series that includes people of all genders where no man has ever won or made it to the finale.

"What I worry about is the threat from within: the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values — values shared with the United States of America."
"Across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat," he added. "Under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will defend your right to offer it in the public square — agree or disagree."

The following code gives us the unambiguous error message :colorI've seen two explanations for why this isn't supported. The first is that there's ambiguity around string identity. Are two strings only considered equal if they point to the same address? Is a null-terminated string the same as its non-null-terminated counterpart? The other reason is that users of  [apparently] expect certain optimizations which are not possible with strings (although, presumably, these same users would know that such optimizations aren't possible with string).Instead, in Zig, there are two common methods for comparing strings.The most common way to compare strings is using  with :stdmem colorstdmem colorstdmem colorstdmem colorThe implementation for  depends on what's being compared. Specifically, it has an optimized code path when comparing strings. Although that's what we're interested in, let's look at the non-optimized version: T a balen  blenalen  aptr  bptra ba_elem b_elema_elem  b_elemWhether we're dealing with slices of bytes or some other type, if they're of different length, they can't be equal. Once we know that they're the same length, if they point to the same memory, then they must be equal. I'm not a fan of this second check; it might be cheap, but I think it's quite uncommon. Once those initial checks are done, we compare each element (each byte of our string) one at a time.The optimized version, which  used for strings, is much more involved. But it's fundamentally the same as the above with SIMD to compare multiple bytes at once.The nature of string comparison means that real-world performance is dependent on the values being compared. We know that if we have 100  branches then, at the worse case, we'll need to call  100 times. But comparing strings of different lengths or strings which differ early will be significantly faster. For example, consider these three cases: str1  10_000  str2  10_000 
    _  stdmem str1 str2 str1  a"  10_000 str2  a"  10_000
    _  stdmem str1 str2 str1  999_999 str2  1_000_000
    _  stdmem str1 str2For me, the first comparison takes ~270ns, whereas the other two take ~20ns - despite the last one involving much larger strings. The second case is faster because the difference is early in the string allowing the  loop to return after only one comparison. The third case is faster because the strings are of a different length:  is returned by the initial  check.The  takes an enum type and a string value and returns the corresponding enum value or null. This code prints "you picked: blue" std 
    red
    blue
    green
    pink color  stdmetaColorInvalidChoicecolorred  stddebugblue  stddebuggreen  stddebugpink  stddebugIf you don't need the enum type (i.e. ) beyond this check, you can leverage Zig's anonymous types. This is equivalent: std  color  stdmeta
        red
        blue
        green
        pinkInvalidChoicecolorred  stddebugblue  stddebuggreen  stddebugpink  stddebugIt's  obvious how this should perform versus the straightforward  approach. Yes, we now have a  statement that the compiler can [hopefully] optimize, but  still has convert our input, , into an enum.The implementation of  depends on the number of possible values, i.e. the number of enum values. Currently, if there are more than 100 values, it'll fallback to using the same  that we explored above. Thus, with more than 100 values it does the  check PLUS the switch. This should improve in the future.However, with 100 or fewer values,  creates a comptime  which can then be used to lookup the value.  isn't something we've looked at before. It's a specialized map that buckets keys by their length. Its advantage over Zig's other hash maps is that it can be constructed at compile-time. For our  enum, the internal state of a  would look something like:// keys are ordered by length
keys:     ["red", "blue", "pink", "green"];

// values[N] corresponds to keys[N]
values:   [.red, .blue, .pink, .green];

// What's this though?
indexes:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3];It might not be obvious how  is used. Let's write our own  implementation, simulating the above  state:str keys  values redbluepinkgreen indexes strlen  indexeslen index  indexesstrlenindex  keyslen key  keysindexkeylen  strlenstdmem key str valuesindex
        index Take note that  are ordered by length. As a naive implementation, we could iterate through the keys until we either find a match or find a key with a longer length. Once we find a key with a longer length, we can stop searching, as all remaining candidates won't match - they'll all be too long.  goes a step further and records the index within  where entries of a specific length begin.  tells us where to start looking for keys with a length of 3 (at index 0).  tells us where to start looking for keys with a length of 5 (at index 3).Above, we fallback to using  for any key which is the same length as our target string.  uses its own "optimized" version:a baptr  bptra ba_elem b_elema_elem  b_elemThis is the same as the simple  implementation, minus the length check. This is done because the  within our  loop is only ever called for values with matching length. On the flip side, 's  doesn't use SIMD, so it would be slower for large strings.In my own benchmarks, in general, I've seen little difference between the two approaches. It does seem like  is generally as fast or faster. It also results in more concise code and is ideal if the resulting enum is useful beyond the comparison.You usually don't have long enum values, so the lack of SIMD-optimization isn't a concern. However, if you're considering building your own  at compile time with long keys, you should benchmark with a custom  function based on .We could manually bucket those  branches ourselves, similar to what the  does. Something like:colorlenstdmem colorstdmem colorstdmem colorstdmem colorUghhh. This highlights the convenience of using  to generate similar code. Also, do remember that  quickly discards strings of different lengths, which helps to explain why both approaches generally perform similarly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI Will Disrupt Outsourced Work</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/14/1359228/how-ai-will-disrupt-outsourced-work?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI startups are poised to disrupt the $300 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, as advances in language models and voice technology enable automation of tasks traditionally handled by human workers.

In healthcare, AI company Juniper said its clients saw 80% fewer insurance claim denials and 50% faster processing times. 

Major BPO providers are responding to the threat, with Wipro reporting a 140% increase in AI adoption across projects and Infosys deploying over 100 AI agents. However, industry analysts say BPOs face structural challenges in transitioning from their labor-based business model to AI-first operations. The shift threatens traditional BPO companies like Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro, which reported revenues between $10-20 billion in their latest fiscal years.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) Initiative Meeting - 2025-02-11</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHa6GhK7L0I</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eHa6GhK7L0I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:59:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

They wanted to chart their own paths, make money for themselves, and have fun doing so. They’d had significant exposure to UNIX at university, and there was a new, free, and open source kernel called Linux from Helsinki. At the same time, there was Peter MacDonald’s Linux distribution, the Softlanding System (SLS), and Patrick Volkerding was publishing fixes for SLS and making them freely available via FTP. Somewhat problematically, most UNIX systems and most Linux systems were exclusively English language oriented. These four students were ready to do something for themselves and they began the process of localizing SLS into German.On the 2nd of September in 1992, the quartet founded Gesellschaft für Software und Systementwicklung mbH (or S.u.S.E.). In English that would be Software and System Development, but the contraction S.u.S.E. also bore more than a passing similarity to the name of Konrad Zuse who’d built the world’s first programmable and Turing-complete computer (depending upon how one defines this) the Z3 in May of 1941.Slackware LinuxIn these halcyon days, the young company had no real hierarchy, no regular meetings, no reports, and no bureaucracy. The company operated in a sort of democratic fashion. Being so small, everyone knew everything that was occurring at any given time. If a major decision needed to be made, they’d simply take an informal vote. If they had unanimity, they’d make the change and this meant that the company could change direction in a single night which was when they normally got the most work done.In 1994, S.u.S.E released a fully localized version of Slackware Linux 2.0 with some patches and software incorporated from other Linux distributions, S.u.S.E. Linux 1.0. This release was quickly followed by 1.1.27 in July. This was a Linux system with the XFree86 2.1.1, TCP/IP, NFS, kernel 1.0.9, GNU CC 2.5.8 and 2.4.5, and documentation on disc. The system requirements were a 386 with at least 4MB of RAM, but if one intended to use X11 the RAM requirement was a minimum of 8MB. The system supported ISA, EISA, VLB, and PCI, but it did not support MCA.Most references of version 4.2 state that the distribution was only available in German, but this is incorrect. The initial boot configuration allows a choice of either English or German.After the installation environment is loaded, when init handed off control to a tty, the user was greeted with a logon screen, again in both languages.From there, YaST would take the user through the installation in a well design curses environment.8bit RTL8019At this point, the system was ready to load Linux.After creating a Linux disk partition, the user is required to reboot (though nothing informs you of this). At that point, the partition changes are written to disk. In my case, this meant that I would need to boot from a floppy. There is an option to create a Linux boot floppy, but I chose to use a Win98 boot floppy instead. This essentially runs through the LOADLIN portion for a second time, after which I restarted the setup, loaded the config for all packages, and proceeded with the installation.Here, selecting the main menu will allow the installer to progress to finishing the installation.After login, there’s a brief delay and then we go through the first run setup procedures.That took an incredibly long time on my modest 1990s system.S.u.S.E. Linux version 5 was released in July of 1997, and that was the version to begin the transition of the distribution to RPMs. Slackware’s TGZs were still supported. That release used kernel 2.0.30, Bash 2.0, Qt 1.2, XFree86 3.3 and FVWM 4.0.45. October of that year saw the release of version 5.1 with the most notable changes being the support of FTP package updates and KDE. This version was five CD-ROMs. Four of these were for the installation, and one was for the LiveCD environment. The final version 5 release was on the 10th of September in 1998, version 5.3 with kernel 2.0.35, KDE 1.0, and Netscape Communicator version 4.05.So, here in the installer, we can see a clear evolution from the prior release. Everything is a bit more refined, the installation was far more straight forward, and we can easily see that what has been reported as a complete rebase on Jurix, was truly more of a merger between the Slackware-rooted origin, and the RPM-based Jurix with its automatic build system. We can also see that S.u.S.E. was now evolving into something unique, something gestalt. That said, my installation on a K6-III crashed repeatedly.S.u.S.E. opened a branch office in Oakland in 1997 as well as more offices across Europe. Not long after these expansions came new partnerships with IBM, SAP, Compaq, and Oracle. For IBM and Compaq, this partnership included S.u.S.E. offering 24-hour support services. The same year, SuSE began offering servers pre-installed with S.u.S.E. Linux. For 1998, the company moved their corporate office from Fürth to Nürnberg. In 1999, the company opened a branch office in the UK.The company released version 6.0 on the 21st of December in 1998, and with this release, the company rebranded as SuSE Linux. Version 6 shipped with kernel 2.0.36, and it saw point release up to 6.4 which released on the 9th of March in 2000. Version 6.4 included YaST2 which was graphical.On the 27th of September in 2000, SuSE Linux version 7 was released. SuSE Linux Professional 7.0 consisted of six CD-ROMs and one DVD for those who had a DVD-ROM drive, two floppies for those who couldn’t boot from optical media, a quick install guide, a handbook, a configuration guide, and an applications guide. By this point, like many other commercial Linux distributions, SuSE included StarOffice, Netscape, Acrobat, GIMP, Sane, KDE, and other familiar applications. It had a graphical YaST2 setup tool, ReiserFS and ext2 filesystems, RPM package management, and retailed for $69.99. SuSE Linux Personal lacked many of the proprietary applications and shipped on three CDs. This version saw released for x86, Alpha, PPC, and SPARC. The last of the version 7 systems was 7.3 released on the 23rd of October in 2001.ItaniumBy November of 2000, something around 66% of SuSE’s revenues were from Linux CD-ROM sales at retail, online, over the phone. Roughly 24% was from services, and the remaining 8% or so was from hardware sales. The company had around forty developers working on open source software, and this didn’t include people who handled the compiling and packaging into RPMs (release engineers), or those who handled support services. Beyond this, the company contributed both money and talent to projects like ReiserFS, KDE, and the Linux kernel.Red HatCalderaMandrakeSuSE Linux 8.0 was released on the 22nd of April in 2002 with Linux kernel 2.4.18, KDE3, KOffice, and several other enhancements. The installer was more automated, had better hardware detection, and YaST2 could detect Windows partitions. Upon the detection of a Windows partition, the installer would suggest changes to hard disk allocation for the installation of SuSE. YaST2 was also much better at configuring the X server with SaX2 (SuSE advanced X configuration). On the media side of things, SuSE 8 included applications for audio mixing, editing, and CD writing. These audio applications were aided by the inclusion of ALSA 0.9 (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) which allowed for the playback of more than one audio stream at a time. Security enhancements also came to SuSE with SuSE Personal Firewall 2, GNU Privacy Guard, OpenSSH, PAM, and IPsec. Version 8 concluded with the release of 8.2 on the 7th of April in 2003.SuSE Linux 9.0 was released on the 15th of October in 2003 with Linux kernel 2.4.21, GNOME 2.2.3, and KDE 3.1.4. This version brought two major changes. First, SuSE Linux 9 was the first distribution to support AMD64. SuSE had reached out to AMD early in the Hammer architecture’s development, and they built an emulator from AMD’s specifications. The company then proceeded to port the entire distribution AMD64 with AutoBuild. When the first hardware arrived at their offices, the system worked flawlessly. The second big addition was support for NTFS (non-root) filesystems.NovellThe first release after acquisition was SUSE Linux 9.1 on the 23rd of April in 2004. This version shipped with kernel 2.6.4, GNOME 2.4, and KDE 3.2.1. SUSE 9.1 brought in some visual changes between the personal and professional editions as well. The personal editions maintained the green theming while the professional editions had blue theming. This was also evident in the default background images.For the first time, with SUSE 9.1, people could download the distribution without any monetary cost. A single CD release was available without support of any kind. For the most part, this was just SUSE Personal without some extra packages.SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 was released in August of 2004 and Novell Linux Desktop 9 (built on much the same package base) was released on the 8th of November in 2004. This release saw official support from IBM, HP, Sun, Dell, SGI, Lenovo, and Fujitsu. For the first time, GNOME became the default, but KDE remained present. Naturally, Ximian’s Evolution became Novell Evolution. Given events at Sun, StarOffice was replaced by OpenOffice. With more of the Ximian acquisition in evidence, the availability of software updates were made apparent to the user with a Red Carpet icon.While SUSE had been an enterprise focused distribution for quite a while, on the 4th of August in 2005, Novell announced that the creation of the openSUSE Project. This would allow for a more open development process, and what had previously been the personal edition became a freely available product without professional support. SUSE Linux 10 was released on the 6th of October in 2005 and it was the first SUSE release to follow this model. SUSE Linux 10 shipped with kernel 2.6.13, GNOME 2.12, and KDE 3.4.2.SUSE Linux 10.1 was released on the 11th of May in 2006 with Xgl, AppArmor, Xen, the ext3 filesystem, Firefox 2, and NetworkManager. To my knowledge, this was the first major inclusion of Xen in any Linux system. Both enterprise server and desktop versions of 10 were released in July of 2006, and the Novell Linux Desktop was dropped in favor of SUSE Linux Enterprise Deskstop. Version bumps and the name change to openSUSE arrived with 10.2 on the 7th of Decemer in 2006. The final version 10 release was made on the 4th of October in 2007 with 10.3 featuring kernel 2.6.22, GNOME 2.12, KDE 3.5.1, and XFCE 4.4.1. This version also included a preview release of KDE4 Beta 2. On the enterprise side, updates were shipped in Service Packs with SP4, the final version 10 service pack, having shipped on the 15th of April in 2011.In November of 2006, Microsoft and Novell signed an intellectual property agreement that involved immunity over patent litigation and freed SUSE Linux users over any possibility of lawsuits from Microsoft. This followed claims from Microsoft that Linux systems were in violation of 235 patents without any disclosure over what those violations were. While some in the community viewed this negatively and were quite vocal about it, this did gain some piece of mind for SUSE to include things like Exchange support, MS Office file format support, and interoperability between the two companies’ directory implementations. This would prove to have lasting effects on both the wider Linux ecosystem and on Microsoft. In the following years, improvements in MS Office support would proliferate, Active Directory support would be common, and Microsoft’s Azure would have Linux support. Microsoft even made SQL Server, VS Code, and Powershell available on Linux.On the 22nd of November in 2010, Novell and Attachmate announced that Novell would be acquired by Attachmate. Jeff Hawn, chairman and CEO of Attachmate, commented:The openSUSE project is an important part of the SUSE business. As noted in the agreement announced today, Attachmate plans to operate SUSE as a stand-alone business unit after the transaction closes. If this transaction closes, then after closing, Attachmate Corporation anticipates no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project as a result of this transaction.On the 30th of April in 2011, Attachmate completed their acquisition of Novell. On Monday, the 2nd of May, eight hundred employees were laid off. openSUSE 12.1 came into the world on the 16th of November in 2011 with kernel 3.1.0, GNOME 3.2, and KDE 4.7. This release also included Snapper for Btrfs snapshot management, and systemd for the init system. System V init was still available to users should they want it. Version 12.2 hit on the 5th of September in 2012 with KDE Plasma 4.8, GNOME 3.4, XFCE 4.10, Firefox 14, Plymouth, GRUB 2, and kernel 3.4.6. Version 12.3, the final for the 12 series, released on the 13th of March in 2013. This version gave version bumps to most software, did away with LiveCDs in favor of USB images, and introduced a “rescue” image with XFCE. openSUSE version 13.1 was released on the 19th of November in 2013 with kernel 3.11.6, GNOME 3.10, KDE Plasma 4.11.2, Firefox 25, LibreOffice 4.1, experimental Wayland support, and YaST rewritten in Ruby. SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 was built on openSUSE 13, and it shipped on the 28th of October in 2014. openSUSE 13.2 followed on the 4th of November in 2014 with version bumps across the board. That same month, the openSUSE project introduced openSUSE Tumbleweed. This is a rolling release distribution with periodic snapshots made into installable images for i686, AMD64, ARM 64, PPC64, IBM zSystems, KVM, Xen, HyperV, and public and private cloud. Live system images are available with GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and rescue.On the 20th of November in 2014, Micro Focus completed its acquisition of Attachmate. Under Micro Focus, SUSE was operated independently from the rest of the organization with its own products. Nils Brauckmann became CEO of SUSE and gained a board seat at Micro Focus.With rolling releases now available, the traditional openSUSE system became openSUSE Leap. The first release of Leap hearkened back to the distribution’s history with version 42.1 becoming available on the 4th of November in 2015. This system was based off of enterprise 12 SP1. With another reference to history, Leap brought about a return to KDE as the default desktop with KDE Plasma 5.8. The 42 series saw two updated releases with 42.2 on the 16th of November in 2016, and 42.3 on the 26th of July in 2017. These later releases were based off of SP2 and SP3 respectively.On the 25th of May in 2018, SUSE released Leap 15 with SUSE Linux Enterprise following on the 25th of June. These were built on the same codebase with GNOME 3.26, LibreOffice 6, GCC 7, Wayland as the display server, and kernel 4.12. Updates of this release are the current offering as of this writing.Micro Focus sold SUSE to EQT AB on the 2nd of July in 2018 for $2.535 billion. Melissa Di Donato became CEO on the 22nd of July in 2019. SUSE finally went public on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the 19th of May in 2021. The company was valued at about $6.1 billion on the first day of trading. Di Donato resigned on the 21st of March in 2023 with Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen being appointed as CEO. On the 17th of August in 2023, EQT delisted SUSE. On the 13th of November in 2023, SUSE merged with Marcel New Lux IV S.A. and the combined entity became SUSE S.A.I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover.

"All I've got from intelligence is that he's preparing the war against Nato countries next year.""And, I think so, but I don't know... god bless we will stop this crazy guy and we will not have war in the world, in Europe - but you will not stop him just to say 'yes, we will stop', it is not enough." He added that "security guarantees" for Ukraine were the only way to stop future threats from Russia.Zelensky also claimed that a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead had damaged the containment shelter at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant overnight, which indicated Putin "is preparing to continue deceiving the world".He wrote on X: “Every night, Russia carries out such attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure and cities. Russia continues to expand its army and shows no change in its deranged, anti-human state rhetoric."This means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations — he is preparing to continue deceiving the world. That is why there must be unified pressure from all who value life – pressure on the aggressor. Russia must be held accountable for its actions."Zelensky is due to meet US vice-president JD Vance in Munich, as well as US secretary of state Marco Rubio.Read more coverage from Yahoo's media partners below. Click the links to skip aheadA Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Kyiv region during the night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday.Radiation levels have not increased, Mr Zelensky and the UN atomic agency said. The drone strike damaged the structure and started a fire - which has been put out, Mr Zelensky added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later denied the claims.JD Vance has sparked a furious backlash for delivering an anti-immigration speech at the Munich Security Conference in which he attacked European leaders and backed those who voted for Brexit.The US vice president was accused of “hypocrisy” and his speech described as “bizarre and dangerous” as he departed from the usual defence focus of speeches at the conference to lash out at the UK and EU over migration and free speech.Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain is committed to Ukraine being on an “irreversible path” to joining Nato after the US appeared to rule out membership for the war-torn country.The Prime Minister bolstered his backing for Kyiv in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky as global leaders gather in Munich for a major security conference.Britain has so far sought to strike a delicate balance between supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and keeping Donald Trump, who says he has agreed with Vladimir Putin to start “negotiations” to end the conflict, on side.Royal Navy ships could be deployed to the Black Sea in a peace keeping mission to deter a new Russian attack, Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested.Ukraine’s president said 110,000 foreign troops might be needed to secure peace in Ukraine if Vladimir Putin agrees to end his three-year war.He outlined at the Munich Security Conference how Ukraine’s armed forces could protect the country if supplied with enough fighter jets and air defences.He also gave a broadbrush picture of how the West could help to protect Ukraine.Negotiations to end the war in Ukraine should not result in “peace that is a capitulation”, as this would be “bad news for everyone”, including the US, French President Emmanuel Macron has said.In an interview with the Financial Times, the French president endorsed Trump's position that it is Europe’s responsibility to ensure Ukraine’s security. “What Trump is saying to Europe is that it is up to you to carry the burden. And I say, it is up to us to take it on,” Macron said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is That 0.05% Extra Yield Really Worth the Risk of Staking Your Crypto?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/is-that-005percent-extra-yield-really-worth-the-risk-of-staking-your-crypto?source=rss</link><author>maxo1st</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 13:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Congratulations, you get 0.05% yield more and farm some points! Sounds great? Sure – until you realize that you’ve just staked risks across multiple layers without even knowing it. But you can ignore that – just like everybody else – until you can’t.The Basics: Staking, Liquid Staking, Restaking - What The … ?Risks - Building a House of Cards on EthereumThe Renzo ezETH Crash: A WarningCan the additional APY truly compensate for the risk? Not really.Even Vitalik Is Cautious About RestakingThe DAO Hack: A Lesson from Ethereum’s Darkest HourConclusion: Innovation Needs TransparencyIt’s spring 2024, and we all think we have to use our ETH to farm EigenLayer Points - the feeling of FOMO is simply overwhelming. These EigenLayer points are the ultimate meta to qualify for the EigenLayer airdrop, so other protocols also jump on this bandwagon and promise airdrops [1][2]. To farm these points, everybody starts to liquid-stake their ETH, then restake it, then restake it again on another platform. Preferably you do this several times to qualify for more potential airdrops like Etherfi, KelpDao, or Renzo. At this time, very few people asked themselves what exactly they were doing and what risks this game-changing innovation may pose for them or DeFi or Ethereum. But let's start at the beginning with a brief explanation of what I am talking about.The Basics: Staking, Liquid Staking, RestakingBefore trying to explain the risks, it is important to understand what these essential terms actually mean.\
 involves locking up ETH on a Proof-of-Stake blockchain like Ethereum to secure the network and earn an annual APY of 3–4%, similar to a term deposit at a bank [3].\
Staking has the advantage over Proof-of-Work blockchains in that it is much more energy-efficient and also more inclusive, as you can quickly participate in staking without specific hardware. However, the disadvantage is that you have no access to the assets while staking and there are sometimes lock-up periods.\
 provides a remedy. It allows users to stake ETH through protocols like Lido and receive a tokenized representation (e.g., stETH), enabling them to earn staking rewards while maintaining the liquidity to interact with DeFi [4]. They can now use this as collateral or simply swap it for other tokens. The advantage is the liquidity of their assets despite staking and thus a contribution to the security of the blockchain.\
The last innovation that is now causing the most headaches is restaking. The concept is new and I think it's the most abstract topic:\
 allows users to leverage their already staked ETH without having to unstake it. While continuing to secure Ethereum’s network, restaked ETH also supports the security of other protocols (Actively Validated Services, or AVS) like bridges, oracles, or other dApps, earning additional APY of at least around 3% upwards [5].\
Now that the basics have been explained, the next ‘logical’ step that we could observe in DeFi, was that the restaked ETH must also be liquid again, obviously… And so, of course, several protocols immediately emerged that made this their mission. And so everyone started to wrap and package the ETH in more and more layers, as the yield keeps increasing with each layer.\
In general, the technology behind restaking is innovative and offers new opportunities. For the many users, it remains a no-brainer: more yield for the same ETH. However, this does not take into account that with each additional layer, new risk is piled up, which makes the additional yield possible in the first place. But how big is this risk? Could it be a ticking time bomb, an actual systemic risk for Ethereum and the whole of DeFi?Risks – Building a House of Cards on EthereumSlashing – the OG staking riskLet's start with the first ‘layer’ of the risks, where you stake your ETH the traditional way to secure the network and achieve a yield of 3-4% (as of February 2025) [3]. The only risk here is the risk of Slashing. This is Ethereum’s mechanism for keeping validators honest; break the rules (e.g., proposing conflicting blocks, too much validator downtime, etc.), and you lose part of your staked ETH and are thrown out of the network [6]. Slashing is very rare, as there are only minimal to no incentives compared to the severe punishment for the validator operators, and as of February 2024, less than 0.04% of all validators have been slashed. To be specific, only 414 validators out of approximately 1,174,000 active validators [7]. To become a validator and take the step of locking up your ETH, you need at least 32 ETH, which is at the same time the upper limit per validator.Too Big to Fail? - The Centralization Dilemma in DeFiThe 32 ETH are too expensive for many users, so they resort to liquid staking, where you use a platform to stake, such as Lido [4]. Lido allows you to stake your ETH via their validators and then receive an equivalent representation of it, namely stETH. This is relatively unproblematic, as the user can always exchange their stETH for their ETH. However, the current situation in DeFi is somewhat more problematic, as Lido is dominating the market share and has a total of 27.58% (12. February 2025, chart below) of all staked ETH under the control of its validators [8].\
This currently equates to almost 9.35 million ETH [9]. As I said before, only 32 ETH can be staked per validator, which fortunately means Lido cannot stake all the ETH in one validator. However, I probably don't need to explain here that Lido, as a centralized unit, still has a hell of a lot of power, and you don't even want to imagine what would happen if Lido made a mistake one day. The concentration risk is huge. This is particularly evident in the case of misconfigurations, such as an incident in October 2023 in which around 20 nodes operated by Lido were slashed [10]. It is precisely this centralization issue that might be replicated in restaking protocols. Let's take the largest restaking protocol Eigenlayer for instance. Eigenlayer currently has a TVL of $12.3 billion, at its maximum in June 2024 was almost $20 billion [11]. At the time of writing, around 10% of the total staked ETH is restaked on EigenLayer [12]. In Lido and EigenLayer, we see a high concentration and centralization risk for the fact, that we are pursuing the mission of decentralization in DeFi and crypto. This entails a high potential risk with single points of failure bundled in Lido and EigenLayer. Thus a single mistake can lead to slashing or liquidation cascades.Restaking, like any brand new innovation, is a new technology that uses unproven and new infrastructure, tech, and code that still need to be tested. One technical error could result in an ultimate super disaster where an entire restaking protocol goes down. The smart contract risk in innovation is unfortunately relatively high. This risk is then combined with the fact that in restaking slashing can occur not only in one validator but also within a restaking protocol like Eigenlayer. The validator must now adhere to the rules of the Ethereum blockchain to stay online and also adhere to the rules of EigenLayer [13]. If it makes a mistake on Ethereum, the validator goes offline, it is slashed and, logically, it also goes offline on EigenLayer. If it makes a mistake on the EigenLayer Protocol, its AVS rewards are canceled, but at least the validator remains online on Ethereum if it has not also violated the Ethereum rules.\
Without a doubt, restaking is innovative and opens up many opportunities, but still, we have to take into consideration that with the possibility of restaking ETH again and again we also add risks again and again. So the risks I just described can be replicated as often as the ETH is restaked. So slashing one Ethereum validator could trigger a cascade of slashing events across restaking protocols and the going offline of many validators, depending on how often the ETH was restaked. In addition, the liquid restaked ETH is also used in DeFi dApps for lending and borrowing, for example, and used as collateral. Each new layer piles on risks like slashing and liquidity cascades, setting up chain reactions most users don’t even notice—until the whole house of cards comes crashing down, which happened for example in the Renzo ezETH crash.The Renzo ezETH Crash: A WarningOn 24 April 2024, the depeg (loss of price matching to the price of the asset that is supposed to represent the liquid version of; in this case, the price of ezETH to ETH) of ezETH of the Renzo protocol occurred. The price of this version of liquid restaked ETH temporarily fell to just $688 [14]. At the time, Renzo was the largest liquid restaking protocol behind Etherfi, as they just announced their airdrop and so their TVL rose 126% to $3.3 billion within a month [14]. The reason for this depeg was due to the end of the airdrop phase which led to a huge sell-off [15]. (Airdrop metas is a topic which I will address in another article) This led to incredible liquidation cascades, for example on Morpho or Gearbox with hundreds of liquidated users. It is estimated that a total value of between $56 million and $340 million was lost through liquidations that day [14][16]. This emphasizes the risks listed above, which are accepted even though they are not properly priced into the APYs in some cases.Many users completely underestimate this risk or are not aware of it. I am not saying that users are not properly informed and not doing their research. However, the barriers to understanding and the explanations are sometimes so abstract that a user who does not deal with it professionally is not sufficiently informed in my opinion. I'll pick up on a statement from my last post in which I claimed that some products are simply becoming too complex and make onboarding more difficult than it has to be [17]. With liquid staking, a user can continue to trade with their ETH and achieve an additional APY of up to 2% through borrowing and lending protocols (with single asset exposure to stETH, for example) [18]. The risk here is relatively moderate as long as the user does not borrow against his collateral and risks being liquidated (which is entirely up to him). However, if we go back to deeper layers, such as in restaking, then the user uses the same stake of ETH multiple times to leverage his exposure. This increases the risks dramatically due to the continued nesting of synthetic and derivative ETH to remain liquid, while the APY only increases marginally and is no longer in relation to this risk taken on. The user almost completely relinquishes actual control at this level of risk and is not sufficiently rewarded for these risks. To emphasize my point, here is a quote from Marcin Kazmierczak, Co-founder & COO of Redstone:“With some restaking protocols offering APYs of 15-20% on assets like ETH, there's a significant risk of investors chasing yields without fully understanding the associated risks.” [19]Even Vitalik Is Cautious About RestakingVitalik Buterin, the father of Ethereum, has a critical view on restaking himself and expresses concern. He naturally promotes innovation around the Ethereum ecosystem, which is understandable and good, but says himself:“We should be wary of application-layer projects taking actions that risk increasing the ‘scope’ of blockchain consensus to anything other than verifying the core Ethereum protocol rules.“ [20]\
I believe many personalities within crypto and Web3 agree with this and share this opinion, as you can read in many articles. Ethereum shines because it is a trustworthy blockchain and efforts are being made to keep it that way. After all, there has already been the DAO debacle in 2016, a repetition that should be prevented at all costs in which Ethereum had to be forked. Vitalik Buterin says in his blog post:“If, on the other hand, you have the intent to rope in the broader Ethereum ecosystem social consensus to fork or reorg to solve your problems, this is high-risk, and I argue that we should strongly resist all attempts to create such expectations.”[20]The DAO Hack: A Lesson from Ethereum’s Darkest HourHands up anyone who can either remember the DAO hack or still knows what it is. It remains a showcase argument for Ethereum, that despite the upgrades and the many years of steady uptime, the blockchain runs smoothly! (I look at you Solana; the blockchain that celebrated at the beginning of February that the blockchain has been running for a year without downtime… [21].) However, one should not forget that there was a hack on Ethereum in 2016 at The Dao, in which 14% of all ETH tokens in circulation were stolen [22]. The decision was made to fork Ethereum to the Ethereum blockchain we know today and Ethereum Classic, on which the reality after the hack still exists and 14% of the ETH was lost (I will also shed light on this story in another article, DeFi History so to speak). This underlines the fact that there are events that could threaten Ethereum and this should not be underestimated. It should be avoided that by stretching the consensus on Ethereum or centralization risks we need another fork in the future to bail us out.Conclusion: Innovation Needs TransparencySo what is the conclusion from all this? Well, ultimately it is now technically possible to optimize the yield you could get from Ethereum by taking more risk, but the APY hardly reflects this risk at all in my opinion. The users are barely or not at all aware of the possible risks because the restaking yields don’t sound like that much for DeFi, so the risks might be underestimated. For me, restaking is worrying until we have reasonable and transparent risk metrics in DeFi that can help users understand them. As in my first article, I am concerned about this development and I doubt that it is reasonable to take this risk without taking DeFi and Web3 “to the next level” from the users perspective [17]. Maybe I am biased because as a finance student, my alarm bells are ringing when I see concepts that strongly resemble rehypothecation; or in other words what led to the collapse of the financial system in 2008. The consequence of the financial crisis was the birth of crypto, DeFi, and the Web3 through the revolution initiated by Satoshi Nakamoto with Bitcoin and the world-famous inscription in the Genesis block “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”, i.e. a direct criticism of the existing financial system [23]. Are we moving towards a system like the one we originally wanted to replace with a better system? Judging by the current state of this potential ticking time bomb in DeFi, I would say unfortunately yes. We need decentralized and transparent risk metrics - otherwise, DeFi will crash like the financial system did in 2008. So here I share Vitalik Buterin's opinion because it was only during my research that I came across this quote from him:“Incorrect answers could lead Ethereum down a path of centralisation and ‘re-creating the traditional financial system with extra steps’[…].” [24]\
Restaking is an innovation and we need those as a driver for DeFi and its adoption, but I remain cautious until the concept has proven itself. Primarily, I am concerned with investor protection because I believe many users don't realize what risks they are exposed to. That's why I agree with Marcin Kazmierczak, Co-founder & COO of Redstone that new and interested users need to be introduced to this topic gradually:“[…]To address this, protocols could adopt graduated entry systems-for instance, starting users with simpler staking options offering 5-7% APY before granting access to more complex and higher-risk products.” [19]\
To me, this seems like a sensible approach that should be used more often in DeFi to make investors aware of the risks. Protocols should introduce transparent risk metrics and educate users more about potential dangers. If we want to build a new and inclusive alternative financial system in a decentralized way, then it is not only necessary to be innovative, but also inclusive and partly educational. Everyone should be able to benefit from it without users falling by the wayside due to a lack of financial knowledge. DeFi is for everyone and therefore it is also the task of all of us to provide the necessary protection and education for everyone.\
Do you agree with Vitalik’s concerns about restaking? Do you think that it is important for the adoption of DeFi to provide risk metrics? What do you think about restaking and were you aware of its potential risks? Share your perspective in the comments!\

ABSTRACT
Are you a little spicy? If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.

In this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.

Neurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.

This talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

Today the Department of Science, Industry and Technology announced that it would be renaming the AI Safety Institute to the "AI Security Institute." (Same first letters: same URL.) With that, the body will shift from primarily exploring areas like existential risk and bias in large language models, to a focus on cybersecurity, specifically "strengthening protections against the risks AI poses to national security and crime."
 
Alongside this, the government also announced a new partnership with Anthropic. No firm services were announced but the MOU indicates the two will "explore" using Anthropic's AI assistant Claude in public services; and Anthropic will aim to contribute to work in scientific research and economic modeling. And at the AI Security Institute, it will provide tools to evaluate AI capabilities in the context of identifying security risks. [...] Anthropic is the only company being announced today -- coinciding with a week of AI activities in Munich and Paris -- but it's not the only one that is working with the government. A series of new tools that were unveiled in January were all powered by OpenAI. (At the time, Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for Technology, said that the government planned to work with various foundational AI companies, and that is what the Anthropic deal is proving out.) "The changes I'm announcing today represent the logical next step in how we approach responsible AI development -- helping us to unleash AI and grow the economy as part of our Plan for Change," Kyle said in a statement. "The work of the AI Security Institute won't change, but this renewed focus will ensure our citizens -- and those of our allies -- are protected from those who would look to use AI against our institutions, democratic values, and way of life."
 
"The Institute's focus from the start has been on security and we've built a team of scientists focused on evaluating serious risks to the public," added Ian Hogarth, who remains the chair of the institute. "Our new criminal misuse team and deepening partnership with the national security community mark the next stage of tackling those risks."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>American troops in Europe are not ‘forever,’ US defense chief warns</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/america-military-presence-europe-not-forever-us-pete-hegseth-warns/</link><author>/u/EUstrongerthanUS</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:56:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian hostility and waning American support trigger broad agreement to boost defense spending — but 5 percent of GDP is too much for most European countries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI is stifling new tech adoption</title><link>https://vale.rocks/posts/ai-is-stifling-tech-adoption</link><author>kiyanwang</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:45:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I propose that the advent and integration of AI models into the workflows of developers has stifled the adoption of new and potentially superior technologies due to training data cutoffs and system prompt influence.I have noticed a bias towards specific technologies in multiple popular models and have noted anecdotally in conversation and online discussion people choosing technology based on how well AI tooling can assist with its usage or implementation.While it has long been the case that developers have considered documentation and support availability when choosing software, AI’s influence dramatically amplifies this factor in decision-making, often in ways that aren’t immediately apparent and with undisclosed influence.Large language models, especially those on the scale of many of the most accessible, popular hosted options, take humongous datasets and long periods to train. By the time everything has been scraped and a dataset has been built, the set is on some level already obsolete. Then, before a model can reach the hands of consumers, time must be taken to train and evaluate it, and then even more to finally deploy it.Once it has finally released, it usually remains stagnant in terms of having its knowledge updated. This creates an AI knowledge gap. A period between the present and AI’s training cutoff. This gap creates a time between when a new technology emerges and when AI systems can effectively support user needs regarding its adoption, meaning that models will not be able to service users requesting assistance with new technologies, thus disincentivising their use.The cutoff means that models are strictly limited in knowledge up to a certain point. For instance, Anthropic’s latest models have a cutoff of April 2024, and OpenAI’s latest models have cutoffs of late 2023.The influence of the popularisation of AI models has also led to the proliferation of AI slop content, which AI companies are likely trying to avoid introducing in their scraped data sets – potentially increasing this knowledge gap.This knowledge gap doesn’t just stifle the adoption of new frameworks and tooling but also the adoption of new and potentially superior features introduced in updates to already in-use frameworks and tooling as a result of the models not yet including information about them in their training set. This is a lesser issue though, because a technology with existing market adoption is bound to have fanatics who will use it, create examples, and produce blog posts, documentation, and other media about it that will eventually end up in training data.While some models are used in contexts where they are equipped with tooling, such as ChatGPT with its internet search capabilities, their prompts often only instruct them to use this functionality when explicitly requested by a user. Of course, plenty of implementations don’t have any access to any internet query functionality at all, such as Claude via its web interface, which will inform you it will only discuss things included in its training data.Of course, if people are reluctant to adopt a new technology because of a lack of AI support, there will be fewer people likely to produce material regarding said technology, which leads to an overall inverse feedback effect. Lack of AI support prevents a technology from gaining the required critical adoption mass, which in turn prevents a technology from entering use and having material made for it, which in turn starves the model of training data, which in turn disincentivises selecting that technology, and so on and so forth.Consider a developer working with a cutting-edge JavaScript framework released just months ago. When they turn to AI coding assistants for help, they find these tools unable to provide meaningful guidance because their training data predates the framework’s release. This forces developers to rely solely on potentially limited official documentation and early adopter experiences, which, for better or worse, tends to be an ‘old’ way of doing things and incentivises them to use something else.I’ve anecdotally noticed that many AI tools have a ‘preference’ for React and Tailwind when asked to tackle a web-based task, or even to create any app involving an interface at all.With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is generally my AI offering of choice given its superior coding ability, my “What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?” profile setting includes the line “When writing code, use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless otherwise noted by me”. Despite this, Claude will  opt to generate new code with React, and in some occurrences even rewrite my existing code into React against my intent and without my consultation.This can be evidenced when asking Claude to use a certain technology, such as Svelte Runes, where it will instead direct the user towards its preferred technology. For example: Build me something with Svelte Runes. I apologize, but I am not able to create Svelte Runes components directly, as the artifact environment only supports certain technologies like React, HTML, and SVG. I can help you build something similar using React, or I can provide you with Svelte Runes code that you can use in your own Svelte project. Which would you prefer?If you’d like to see a React version, I can create something with similar reactive functionality using React’s hooks. Or if you want Svelte Runes code specifically, I can write that for you to use in your own environment.To test if popular models do have built-in bias for React, I logged into the web interfaces of four of the current most popular AI chat platforms via my free account and asked the models to “Create me a web app. It can do anything.”. I repeated this with each of the four models three times in fresh chats with previous chats deleted and any shared context (such as ChatGPT’s memory feature) disabled or cleared between each test.I asked Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet with blank personal preferences and artifacts enabled. The first time it opted to create a mood tracking app, the second a reading list manager, and the third time a to-do list. Each time it chose to generate it using React with Tailwind CSS for styling. It generated each project in an artifact which offered an interactive preview directly in the interface.I asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o with both custom instructions and memory disabled. It produced a note-taking app the first time, a random quote generator the second time, and a to-do list the third time. All using React with Tailwind for styling and presented in canvases. These canvases came with a preview button, which, much like with Claude, offered an interactive preview of the React project it built directly in the interface.I asked Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash with app activity disabled. All three times it built to-do list apps using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time, it also noted that I should consider using JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, namely React, Angular, and Vue - in that order.I asked DeepSeek’s DeepSeek-V3, and it returned a to-do list app using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the second request, it created a project outline for a to-do list app, but this time with Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite. The third time, it created another outline for a note-taking app but with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.DeepSeek had the greatest variation in technology used but is the least accessible model and didn’t actually ‘create’ the app as requested – merely a general outline for it.These tests show both Claude and ChatGPT have a strong preference for React and Tailwind,  that Gemini has a preference for HTML/CSS/JS but will recommend React and that DeepSeek is much more flexible and varied with its technological choices, though requires more prompting to produce an actual output.I’d suggest that a beginner developer, or someone creating an app exclusively via prompting, is likely to use ChatGPT due to its position in the zeitgeist and use whatever output the model first produces without much second thought – thus influencing their tech selection without their realising.Even if a developer does opt to use another framework or toolset, there is a chance that the model will prod them towards a selection more aligned with its system prompt, even going as far as rewriting their code to its ‘preference’ against user request, as evidenced by Claude ignoring my request for vanilla web technologies.That is assuming that a specific framework or toolset hasn’t already been chosen by the user specifically because they have heard or experienced it being best handled by AI models. Also, while this very much applies to larger technical choices, such as what framework or general tooling a project may choose, it also trickles down into smaller decisions, such as what libraries or modules they may import.I think it is evident that AI models are influencing technology, and that the technologies currently in use – especially those that reached popularity before November 2022, when ChatGPT was released, or that are otherwise in current data sets – will be around for a long time to come, and that AI models’ preferential treatment of them will expand their adoption and lifespan.I think it would be prudent for AI companies to provide more transparent documentation of technology biases in their models, like they disclose that their models can make mistakes. These models are becoming a common part of developer knowledge and decision-making, and we’re letting the training and prompting decisions of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc shape the entire direction of software development.As for further research on this topic, if one had a collection of system prompts over time, it may be possible to compare them to download trends of specified packages and identify correlations. Of course, there are a lot of other influences on the download and adoption of packages, so this may prove difficult and provide data too noisy and influenced by outside variables to be unusable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From hippies to hawks - the Greens&apos; pivot on NATO | Berlin Briefing Podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KexPZD1GE8I</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KexPZD1GE8I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:45:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/

				Dion said Canada and European countries are working on a cohesive strategy to address tariff threats from the United States.“Canada and Mexico are the first ones, but Europeans know that they may be targeted as well. We’re anticipating that. They are working with us about how can we have a cohesive way to convince the US administration that trade wars are painful for everyone… and not something that you should do between friends.”U.S. Vice President JD Vance is also in Paris for the AI Action Summit, but it’s not clear whether he will meet with Trudeau, as no meeting has been announced to date.Story continues below advertisementBoth Canada and Mexico were granted at least 30-day reprieves from the Trump’s broad-based tariff threat being realized just last week.On Wednesday, Trudeau will travel to Brussels to meet with E.U. leaders, which could offer Canada an opportunity to shore up its relationship with the European Union in the context of Trump’s threats.Dion told reporters Monday Canada won’t be successful in trade diversification unless that effort includes Europe.“Now that we see that unfortunately for now at least the U.S. administration is not as reliable as we thought, not respecting treaties as we thought, we need Europeans and Canadians to work very closely together,” Dion said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe denies dropping AI liability rules under pressure from Trump</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/europe-denies-dropping-ai-liability-rules-under-pressure-from-trump/</link><author>Natasha Lomas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:01:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Union has denied that recent moves to row back on some planned tech regulation — principally by ditching the AI Liability Directive, a 2022 draft law which had been aimed at making it easier for consumers to sue over harms caused by AI-enabled products and services — were made in response to pressure […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple," Tsai said at the World Government Summit in Dubai. Apple continues to work with Baidu on AI features for iPhones in China, The Information reported on Thursday, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
 
While Apple's phones outside China utilize a combination of its proprietary Apple Intelligence and OpenAI's ChatGPT, Tsai did not specify whether the Alibaba partnership would follow a similar model. In China, consumer-facing AI products require regulatory approval, and The Information reported earlier that both Alibaba and Apple have already submitted materials to authorities.

Here’s a concise overview of the significant developments that have unfolded thus far:AI Innovations and RivalriesIn the realm of artificial intelligence, French startup Mistral AI has emerged as a formidable competitor to industry giants. Founded in April 2023 by former engineers from Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms, Mistral AI has developed advanced open-weight large language models, positioning itself as a notable alternative to proprietary AI systems.Their open-weight large language models have gained significant traction, particularly in Europe, where there's a growing demand for alternatives to U.S.-based AI systems. Mistral AI's approach aligns with the EU's focus on open and transparent AI development. \n Defense Sector Developments\
Another French startup, Exotrail, has made significant strides in the defense sector. Specializing in space logistics and propulsion systems, Exotrail has been instrumental in advancing rocket technology, contributing to Europe’s growing presence in space defense initiatives.In February 2025, they secured a major contract with the European Space Agency to develop next-generation satellite propulsion systems, further solidifying their position in the industry. \n Controversial Moves in Venture Capital\
In early February 2025, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced the hiring of Daniel Penny, a former Marine veteran, as a deal partner for its American Dynamism team. Penny was previously involved in a 2023 subway incident in New York City, where he restrained Jordan Neely, a homeless man, leading to Neely’s death.Penny was acquitted of criminal charges in December 2024. Many questioned the decision, given Penny's controversial past, while others defended it as an example of second chances. This move has led to increased scrutiny of hiring practices in the VC industry. \n Cryptocurrency Turbulence\
In the cryptocurrency arena, President Donald Trump launched a meme coin named $TRUMP just before his inauguration. The $TRUMP coin saw an explosive growth shortly after its launch, with its value soaring overnight.The coin's market capitalization reached approximately $14 billion at its peak. However, it's important to note that shortly after, Melania Trump introduced her own meme coin, $MELANIA, which also experienced rapid growth followed by a sharp decline. The $MELANIA coin's market cap reached around $5 billion at its peak. \n Government Efficiency Initiatives\
President Trump appointed Elon Musk to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This initiative aims to streamline federal operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies. Musk has assembled a team of young technologists, often referred to as “baby-faced assassins,” to spearhead this effort.\
The DOGE is not a traditional Cabinet-level department but a temporary organization within the Executive Office of the President. Musk's team of young technologists includes Akash Bobba (21), Edward Coristine (19), Luke Farritor (23), Gautier Cole Killian (24), Gavin Kliger (25), and Ethan Shaotran (22). Their appointment has raised concerns about their experience and qualifications. \n Geographical Renaming Controversies\
In a move reflecting his “America First” policy, President Trump ordered the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. This decision has sparked debates among cartographers, politicians, and the public, reminiscent of past presidential actions such as the renaming of North America’s highest peak from Denali back to Mt. McKinley.With these rapid-fire developments, 2025 is shaping up to be anything but slow. If the first two months are any indication, we’re in for a wild ride—expect more surprises, more drama, and a whole lot of shaking things up. Buckle up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here&apos;s What Devs Are Saying About New GitHub Copilot Agent – Is It Really Good?</title><link>https://favtutor.com/articles/github-copilot-agent/</link><author>/u/ImpressiveContest283</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:50:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With the introduction of AI, coding has never been easier. To simplify it further, GitHub Copilot is here to improve the working experience, helping code faster and better. If GitHub Copilot has undergone a transition from being a mere passive suggestion engine for the code to being an active collaborator that simplifies development, Agent Mode takes it one step further. Think of it as an autonomous co-coder, a peer programmer who prods and pushes forward the work on your projects.The New GitHub Copilot Agent ModeAgent Mode is like having a co-coder within the programming team, prioritizing your development activity over that of any other person. It now allows Copilot to: It constantly improves and enhances the code it generates, always searching for optimal solutions.On detection of an error, it automatically assumes the responsibility for spotting and correcting the source, thus killing debugging efforts.It provides you with all terminal commands and facilitates running those commands for more speedy working.It goes to infer subsequent underlying tasks beyond your instructions so all solutions would be comprehensive.An example would be tasking the agent to implement a web application for tracking marathon training. Agent Mode can set up the project structure alone; create the relevant components and even fix runtime errors to provide seamless development.Auto Complete Coding Tasks with easeWith Next Edit Suggestions (NES), GitHub Copilot has introduced a feature of code editing that does editing by predicting and suggesting modifications to existing code. NES accounts for the fact that coding often involves refining code already written. This feature is now available for use along with Visual Studio Code, where developers can enable NES to receive intelligent edit recommendations that thereby improve coding efficiency and accuracy.Rapid Coding and Beginner-FriendlyBy providing high-level instructions, Copilot’s Agent Mode generates the necessary code components, eliminating the need for manual coding. Moreover, Agent Mode iteratively improves the code, optimizing performance and ensuring functionality without human intervention. Beyond the initial instructions, Copilot infers additional necessary tasks, such as setting up game logic and user interfaces, to create a fully functional application.GitHub Copilot Agent vs other coding assistantsCursor is an advanced AI-driven coding tool aimed at boosting developer efficiency.Copilot is designed to blend effortlessly into several integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains and provide immediate inline code recommendations and auto-completion options.On the other hand, Cursor operates as an independent AI-enhanced editor derived from Visual Studio Code, equipped with features like proactive code generation, intelligent auto-completion, and smart rewriting capabilities.While many users commend Copilot for its seamless integration and intuitive user interface, Cursor stands out for providing a richer integration of AI within its ecosystem.A Glimpse into the Future: Though Agent Mode is already a leap into revolution, GitHub’s Project Padawan hints at an even more exciting future. It aims to create a self-sufficient software engineering (SWE) agent capable of completing entire tasks without human intervention. Just picture a future where you tell Copilot to fix GitHub issues and write whole modules. Features like Issue resolution and continuous learning could transform the very way that developers approach software engineering.Divided Opinions: The other side of the coinAlthough several developers have included the Copilot in their flow, that is not to say they did not face a fair share of challenges. Netizens on X and Reddit are divided over the new AI Agent and have pointed out how the tool creates code or content that sometimes feels generic or shallow. Importantly, the AI-generated output needs several thorough checks against project requirements and coding standards.The Agent Mode of GitHub Copilot is set to change the landscape of software development by relieving developers from mundane tasks such as debugging, documentation, or testing.

This investigation was a collaboration between myself and my colleagues.We’ve been upgrading the operating system from CentOS to Ubuntu on hosts across our fleet. Our CentOS hosts run an outdated Linux kernel version (3.10), whereas our Ubuntu hosts run a more modern kernel version (6.8). In August 2024, we began rolling out the Ubuntu upgrade across our Apache web servers. When we migrated larger portions of our fleet to Ubuntu, we began seeing elevated listen overflow errors. This elevated error rate prompted us to roll back the Ubuntu upgrade while we debugged:Apache listens on a socket for incoming web requests. When incoming requests arrive more quickly than Apache can serve them, the queue of requests waiting to be served grows longer. This queue is capped to a configurable size. When the queue overflows its maximum size, we have a .Listen overflows are a symptom of either of two things: the rate of incoming web requests is too high, and / or Apache is serving web requests too slowly.Each listen overflow that occurs means we failed to serve a web request. This can result in user-facing errors. Furthermore, if the listen overflows are a symptom of web requests being served slowly, it means users may be experiencing slow page loads.Listen overflows occurred a few minutes after a newly autoscaled web server was pooled. They did not tend to recur subsequently. Furthermore, web requests had elevated latency during this same time period:We believed listen overflows were occurring because web requests served in the first few minutes after the host was pooled were being served unusually slowly.Log lines,  timing information, and  flame graphs showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. But investigating further, we found evidence that the network was performing normally. Instead, PHP had seemingly stalled for over a second. The below log line indicates that a memcached SET command was slow, but network packet captures on both the client and the server that we analyzed in Wireshark indicate that the SET command experienced normal network latency. The client waited over 1 second before sending the subsequent GET command, as if our PHP script stalled after the packet was received but before we recorded the elapsed time.[Tue Sep 24 21:20:54 2024] [info] Memcached operation exceeded 20ms :operation="set"  key="warmup_key_7746_2"
  
  
    Is it due to elevated system CPU? (yes) #Adding on to the evidence pointing away from network problems, we saw a large spike in system CPU usage about four minutes after newly autoscaled hosts were booted. If we waited until after this spike in system CPU to pool the hosts, we experienced no listen overflows. This spike in system CPU only occurred on Ubuntu hosts – CentOS did not have this problem:This made us realize that the problems we were seeing were unrelated to pooling the hosts – the spike in system CPU occurred regardless of whether the hosts were pooled. During the spike in system CPU, we saw logs in :workqueue: inode_switch_wbs_work_fn hogged CPU for >10000us 4 times, consider switching to WQ_UNBOUNDAnd  showed kernel workers were using lots of CPU in a function :We made a  recording demonstrating that when system CPU spikes, the kernel is busy inside :
  
  
    Why did we initially suspect the network? #Our logs and profiling tools showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. However, when CPU is busy, network operations may appear to slow down disproportionately. Network calls require CPU context switches (I think?). After a process blocked on network receives a response, the process may spend a long time waiting in the CPU run queue before it gets scheduled again when the CPU is busy. Network operations that appear slow at the user space level may be a symptom of CPU busyness.Although there can be cases where this is not true, it has been my experience that when the network is the cause of slowness, CPU usage on client hosts is often lower than normal. When the client is blocked waiting for the network, it is often more idle. In retrospect, perhaps the fact that elevated CPU was one of the symptoms we were seeing should have pointed us away from network issues.We believed something in the kernel function  was causing elevated system CPU. This function is in a file , which contains functions related to the writeback functionality of the Linux page cache. We knew that system CPU was elevated about four minutes after new hosts were booted. One of the first things a new host does is download the latest code – this is part of our host bootstrapping process and involves writing thousands of files to disk. We wondered if the process of flushing the dirty pages to disk was causing the elevated system CPU. While we did not see elevated disk write metrics during the system CPU spike, we decided to test this theory. We added a  call after the  command that downloads the code on new hosts. In theory, that should synchronously write the dirty pages in the page cache to disk. Perhaps by controlling when the page cache was flushed to disk, we could control when the spike in system CPU occurred and ensure that it occurred before we pooled the host. This attempt, however, was unsuccessful. We saw no spike in system CPU when calling . Furthermore, we still saw the spike in system CPU a minute or two later.We were back to the drawing board. As we mentioned above, one of the first things a new host does is download the latest code. This process is called , and it runs as a systemd oneshot service. We found something perplexing: if we prevented the  service from running, we never saw the spike in system CPU. And if we subsequently ran the  service manually, we would see the spike in system CPU a couple minutes later. This implies that something in  was the cause of the issues. However, if we ran the  command in  manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spikes in system CPU. This apparent contradiction led us on a wild goose chase of trying to determine if some systemd service that was dependent on  was the cause of the elevated system CPU, or if there was some subtle difference in the way we were running the commands in our shell versus how systemd was running the commands.
  
  
    Is it inode cgroup switching? (yes) #Each of the thousands of files that is written by the  service has a corresponding index node, also known as an inode, that the kernel uses to store file metadata. Control groups, also known as cgroups, are a feature of Linux which allows for setting per process limits on system resources. For example, cgroups allow us to limit a given process from consuming too much memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, etc. Every process belongs to a cgroup. Cgroups form a tree-like hierarchical structure. Processes in a given cgroup are given limits both by the cgroup to which they belong and that cgroup’s parents.In the context of cgroups, page cache writeback is tracked at the inode level. A given inode is assigned to whichever cgroup contains the process that is responsible for the majority of writes to the inode’s file. If a new process starts writing a lot to a file, the file’s inode may switch to the new process’s cgroup. Likewise, if a process managed by systemd is terminated, systemd will remove the process’s cgroup, at which point any inodes assigned to the process’s cgroup will be moved to the parent cgroup.The  that we believed was causing the elevated system CPU is responsible for moving an inode from one cgroup to another in the context of writeback. We got more insight by running this  command on a newly booted host:% sudo bpftrace -e '
tracepoint:writeback:inode_switch_wbs {
  printf(
    "[%s] inode is switching! inode: %d old cgroup: %d new cgroup: %d\n",
    strftime("%H:%M:%S", nsecs),
    args->ino,
    args->old_cgroup_ino,
    args->new_cgroup_ino
  );
}'
During the spike in system CPU, we saw thousands of these lines printed out by the  command:[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730800 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730799 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
...

Each line corresponds to a file written by  that was switching from ’s dying cgroup to the parent cgroup. The old cgroup identifier ( corresponds to ’s cgroup. The new cgroup identifier () corresponds to the parent cgroup.The  command prints out data from a kernel tracepoint in the Linux kernel’s writeback code. The fields available to print in this tracepoint can be viewed via:% sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/writeback/inode_switch_wbs/format
name: inode_switch_wbs
ID: 886

    field:char name[32];    offset:8;   size:32;    signed:0;
    field:ino_t ino;    offset:40;  size:8; signed:0;
    field:ino_t old_cgroup_ino; offset:48;  size:8; signed:0;
    field:ino_t new_cgroup_ino; offset:56;  size:8; signed:0;

print fmt: "bdi %s: ino=%lu old_cgroup_ino=%lu new_cgroup_ino=%lu", REC->name, (unsigned long)REC->ino, (unsigned long)REC->old_cgroup_ino, (unsigned long)REC->new_cgroup_ino
We found that when we added a  to the end of the script that  executes, we could delay the spike in system CPU by one hour. Because systemd only removes a service’s cgroup when its process exits, the  delayed when inodes switched from one cgroup to another.We found a systemd directive that allows us to turn off certain cgroup accounting features: . If either the  or  controllers are disabled, the kernel will not perform cgroup writeback or any of the related accounting and cgroup switching. We found that by creating a systemd slice with those controllers disabled and configuring ’s unit file to use that slice, we could no longer reproduce the elevated system CPU. We had solved our performance issue.No more system CPU spike and no more listen overflows:

  
  
    Do we have a minimal reproduction script? #We came up with a minimal reproduction of the issue:$ sudo mkdir -p /var/random-files && sudo systemd-run --property=Type=oneshot bash -c 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=400000 | split -a 16 -b 1k - /var/random-files/file.'This command creates 400,000 files, each consisting of 1,024 random bytes. The files have names like /var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and /var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab. This command is run as a systemd oneshot service. Within anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes after this command finishes, we see a spike in system CPU. Viewing  will confirm this (press  to show kernel threads in ) – we see kernel workers using lots of CPU in the function .
  
  
    Why wasn’t CentOS affected? #The initial release of cgroups, known as cgroups v1, was in kernel version 2.6.24. Cgroups v1 has since been replaced by a new implementation: cgroups v2. Cgroups v2 was officially released in kernel version 4.5. Our old CentOS operating system used kernel version 3.10. We believe this inode switching CPU issue is related to the  and  controllers introduced in cgroups v2. Thus CentOS, which uses cgroups v1, is not vulnerable to this issue.
  
  
    Why couldn’t we reproduce when running rsync manually? #Recall that when we ran the  command from  manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spike in system CPU. It turns out that each interactive ssh session you have open creates its own cgroup. Below is the output of  on a web server on which I have two interactive ssh sessions open. One session is running a  command, and the other session is running . The two cgroups are called  and :% sudo systemd-cgls
Control group /:
-.slice
├─user.slice
│ └─user-10101.slice
│   ├─user@10101.service …
│   │ └─init.scope
│   │   ├─1710746 /lib/systemd/systemd --user
│   │   └─1710793 (sd-pam)
│   ├─
│   │ ├─1708943 sshd: dleibovic [priv]
│   │ ├─1711073 sshd: dleibovic@pts/0
│   │ ├─1711171 -zsh
│   │ └─1716022 sleep 100

│     ├─1781577 -zsh
│     └─1791367 systemd-cgls
...
These  cgroups stick around until you terminate your ssh session. After terminating your ssh session, systemd removes the corresponding cgroup. With this insight, we tested terminating the interactive ssh session after manually running the  commands. Sure enough, about 2 minutes after we terminated the ssh session, we saw the big spikes in system CPU caused by inode cgroup switching.We suspected that this performance issue was caused by either the hypervisor or the kernel. We shared our findings with Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. Canonical confirmed that it is a kernel issue that was likely introduced by a Linux kernel commit from 2021. More details are available in the public bug report, in which I have commented. We are hopeful that Canonical will engage with the Linux kernel developers and eventually fix this performance issue.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub - gopher-fleece/gleece: Gleece - bringing joy and ease to API development in Go!</title><link>https://github.com/gopher-fleece/gleece</link><author>/u/h_talker</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:21:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I come from the Node.js / TypeScript ecosystem and have recently started working with Go as the technology for high-performance and CPU-intensive microservices.I was missing the TSOA approach and code styling for REST API implementation, meaning writing ordinary functions and declaring HTTP info, where the framework handles the rest - routing, validation, documentation, authentication, etc.So...

		At KubeCon NA 2024, Solo.io announced its intention to donate the Gloo Gateway open source project to the CNCF, to benefit the broader cloud native ecosystem. In case you are not familiar with Gloo Gateway, it is the most mature and widely deployed Envoy-based gateway in the market today. Built on open source and open standards, Gloo Gateway is Kubernetes-native and implements the Kubernetes Gateway API. Today, we’d like to update you on some exciting developments since the announcement.What is a gateway, and why donate Gloo Gateway to CNCF?If you are using Kubernetes, you most likely need a gateway to control traffic going into or out of your cluster. Gateways are a critical component of the Kubernetes ecosystem, which is why the Kubernetes community collectively developed the Gateway API based on lessons learned from the Ingress API and Istio. With the growth of AI workloads and the rising need for traffic and cost control for calling LLM providers, gateways play an even more critical role in controlling and securing all-direction traffic—north-south, east-west, or inter-service communication.While Gloo Gateway is the most mature and feature-rich Envoy-based gateway today, we believe that under vendor-neutral governance, the project’s adoption and ecosystem integration will reach new heights. Donating the project to the CNCF will expand the contributor base, foster innovation across organizations, and provide a battle-tested, feature-rich, vendor-neutral gateway project to the diverse global CNCF user community.In November 2024, we moved the Gloo open source repository to the k8sgateway repository as a preparatory step for the donation. After working with the CNCF TOC, Kubernetes SIG-Network, and steering committee leaders, we renamed the project to kgateway.Given Gloo’s large adopter base, we believe kgateway qualifies as a CNCF incubation project. Due to the lengthy due diligence process for incubation projects, we decided to donate it as a CNCF sandbox project instead. We look forward to working with the CNCF TOC and TAG Network leaders for the upcoming sandbox review.Working closely with the maintainer community, we established governance for the project that rewards maintainership while ensuring no single company has a controlling stake. Using the git-vote bot for transparency, we successfully held our first governance vote. Out of 10 eligible voters (including 4 maintainers outside Solo.io), nine voted favorably on the proposed governance PR:In addition to renaming the project, recruiting maintainers, and establishing governance, we’ve been focused on: Developing buildable, vendor-neutral artifacts, set to launch in the coming weeks.Improved Development Velocity: Establishing robust pipeline checks for PRs, including linting, Kubernetes Gateway API conformance tests, and end-to-end testing. Ensuring the project remains highly extendable, aligning with core design principles of kgateway and Envoy.A shout-out to our core maintainers and contributors for laying this solid foundation for innovation.You may notice that the Gloo open source repository still exists. This is temporary during the transition period. With Gloo’s large open source user base, we understand that migrating from Gloo to kgateway takes time. In upcoming releases, we plan to deprecate the Gloo repository to focus all open-source efforts on kgateway.We aim to make kgateway the most popular gateway for all-direction traffic—north-south, east-west, or inter-service communication. In addition to implementing the latest Kubernetes Gateway API features, we’re prioritizing:Traffic control for AI workloadsAs workloads like AI agents run on Kubernetes clusters, questions arise:How securely do they connect to LLM services such as OpenAI or Gemini?Are these services local or external, with usage-based costs?How should credentials and backup LLMs be managed?Do you want each developer to develop prompt guard and enrichment in their own AI workloads? Kgateway simplifies these challenges with two proposed declarative APIs for routing traffic to LLM providers while applying advanced policies such as secret management, backup LLMs, prompt guard or enrichment, and more. Refer to the enhancement proposal for more information.The Gateway API Inference extension, sponsored by Kubernetes SIG-Network, focuses on extending the Kubernetes Gateway API with inference-specific routing extensions. It introduces the concept of an “InferencePool” (composed of one or more inference pods), enabling application developers to effectively route requests based on AI workload requirements. Daneyon Hanson has been leading our work for interference extensions and we are proud to see him nominated as a maintainer on the Gateway API Inference extension project as a result!Providing advanced Layer 7 features for Istio in ambient modeAmbient mode splits Istio functionality into a secure overlay layer (ztunnels) and a Layer 7 processing layer (waypoint). With kgateway as the waypoint proxy, users gain advanced L7 features such as request transformation, retries, and traffic control for AI workloads connecting to LLM services. This pluggability ensures consistent operational experiences for north-south and inter-service traffic. Steven Landow, who is a maintainer on both Istio and kgateway, is leading this effort.To explore additional roadmap initiatives or propose updates, please refer to our roadmap document.Are you interested in exploring kgateway, or are you already a Gloo Gateway user? We’d love to hear from you and shape the future of kgateway together. If working on cutting-edge cloud-native projects excites you, join us as a contributor! Connect with us via:Let’s work together and build kgateway into the future of cloud connectivity!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>14.02.2025, russian dron strike on chernobyl nuclear power plant sarcophagus result</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ip5sd3/14022025_russian_dron_strike_on_chernobyl_nuclear/</link><author>/u/Adventurous-End-7633</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:05:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anyone can push updates to the doge.gov website</title><link>https://www.404media.co/anyone-can-push-updates-to-the-doge-gov-website-2/</link><author>mahkeiro</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 07:31:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Benchmarking vision-language models on OCR in dynamic video environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06445</link><author>ashu_trv</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 07:26:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: 30 World-Changing Prompts: OpenAI&apos;s AI Singularity, Deep Research Has Arrived (2/14/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-14-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 07:11:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @bill-achola [ 3 Min read ]

      13 February 2025
      Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System InterfaceWebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
 port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new  port.Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm export
in the resulting Wasm binary.To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition://go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that
can be called from the host.This is analogous to the cgo  directive,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though  uses a different, simpler mechanism.A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build
flag.$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
 function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The  function must be called before any other exported functions.
The  function will not be automatically invoked.To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using Wazero, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.Supporting rich types between the host and the clientGo 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with  functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a
pointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported
field types
(see the documentation for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A  function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the  function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with  and
 functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zed now predicts your next edit with Zeta, our new open model</title><link>https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction</link><author>ahamez</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:50:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Zed is built for speed. We've always strived for an editing experience that feels . But what's faster than instant?  A tool that anticipates your next move. That's why we're introducing edit prediction in Zed, powered by Zeta, our new open source model.Here's a quick walkthrough:Edit Prediction in action.As you work, Zed now predicts your next edit, so you can apply it just by hitting . Once you accept a prediction, you can perform multiple follow-up edits by pressing  repeatedly, saving you time and keystrokes. We've received  of requests for this functionality, and we've poured our hearts into making it feel like a natural extension of the Zed experience.You can use Zeta for free during this public beta by downloading Zed and signing in with your GitHub account. Edit prediction won't be free forever, but right now we're just excited to share and learn.Edit prediction transforms  into a magical, universal key. But what about the existing uses of , such as indenting lines? And what happens when there's both an edit prediction  suggestions from your language server? We didn't want a powerful new feature to come at the expense of the existing editing experience in Zed.When language server completions are visible, Zed won't preview the predicted edit until you press  or . As soon as you press the modifier, Zed previews the edit and hides the menu to enable an unobstructed review. On macOS, you can just hit  to confirm, or back out by releasing  to restore the language server completions menu.On Linux,  is often reserved by the window manager, so we offer  as an alternative default. We chose  because it's on the QWERTY home row and represents rightward movement in Vim. If your Linux window manager doesn't claim , you're free to use that binding as well.Zeta is derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, and is fully open source, including an open dataset. If you're working in an open source repository, we'd love your help improving Zeta by contributing to its dataset. Please bear with us initially, as we will be reviewing the submitted data before publishing to ensure everyone's safety and privacy. We're excited to figure this out and see a community effort form to make edit prediction better everywhere, most especially in Zed!How Zed's Open-Source Edit Predictions WorkRichard Feldman and Antonio Scandurra talk about how Zed's new Edit Prediction feature works under the hood. This includes how the Zed team developed and open-sourced both the code and the dataset behind the fine-tuned Zeta language model that powers it!Most coding models are trained on a "fill in the middle" task. You give them a prefix and a suffix, and they generate what goes in between.This works for completing text at the cursor, but we wanted Zeta to predict edits at arbitrary locations, which doesn't fit into this structure.In our experience, models aren't very good at producing granular edits, but they do excel at rewriting larger chunks of code. So that's where we started: given a list of recent edits and the cursor position, we asked the model to rewrite a snippet of text around the cursor, incorporating one or more edit predictions in the rewritten text.Before writing a single line of code, we created a set of tests to check if our idea worked. Testing the output of a large language model is tricky because, on every run, you can get slightly different results even when feeding it the exact same input. This can be mitigated by using a temperature of  and, for providers that support it, providing a seed for the RNG.That said, code can often be written in many different but equally valid ways. So even when Zeta's output differs from our expected answer, it might still be doing exactly what we want—just taking a different path to get there. This makes traditional unit testing approaches particularly challenging when working with LLMs.This led us to take a different approach—instead of strict assertions, we used a larger LLM to evaluate Zeta's edits. By writing our test assertions in plain English and having Claude check if the results matched our intent, we could validate that Zeta was making sensible edits, even when its exact output differed between runs. This ended up being much more practical than trying to make brittle assertions about specific tokens.Here's an example taken from our eval suite:We took our first stab at making those tests pass by using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B and giving it clear instructions for which types of edits we wanted it to predict. Here's the initial system prompt we used and you can look through the history to see how we kept changing it to pass the eval suite.This worked out surprisingly well for the first 4-5 evals. However, as soon as we introduced more, we started noticing that it got harder and harder to pass them all consistently. Changing the prompt caused the new evals to pass, but made the old ones fail. Overall, it felt like a flaky process and we didn't feel confident this would lead to the system being robust enough to be used in production.Moreover, using a 32b model wasn't really compatible with our strict latency requirements (more on that later).After playing around with different approaches, we decided to go with supervised fine-tuning using Unsloth and LoRA. The idea was to teach Zeta two key things: figuring out what changes a developer might want next based on their recent edits, and then actually applying those changes cleanly to the code without introducing weird side effects.But we had a classic chicken-and-egg problem—we needed data to train the model, but we didn't have any real examples yet. So we started by having Claude generate about 50 synthetic examples that we added to our dataset. We then used that initial fine-tune to ship an early version of Zeta behind a feature flag and started collecting examples from our own team's usage.This approach let us quickly build up a solid dataset of around 400 high-quality examples, which improved the model a lot! However, we kept running into edge cases that would trip the model up. The most annoying ones were when Zeta was working with a small piece of code in a larger file—it would sometimes get confused and make random deletions or insertions that had nothing to do with what the user was trying to do, and it didn't seem like adding more examples steered the model away from those mistakes.To handle these edge cases, we conducted another pass using direct preference optimization (DPO). This technique let us go beyond simply showing the model what good edits look like—we could also teach it what edits . With DPO, we could fine-tune Zeta by providing both positive and negative examples, helping it learn the subtle differences between helpful and problematic edits.We found that just ~150 carefully selected examples were enough to significantly improve Zeta's behavior on tricky cases. Of course, we think we can make it even better by expanding our training data with more diverse examples, and we're excited to keep pushing the boundaries here.Like every feature in Zed, latency was a critical factor for edit prediction. When we started, we set aggressive performance targets: predictions should be delivered in under 200ms for the median case (p50) and under 500ms for the 90th percentile (p90). The challenge was that rewriting complete excerpts, while enabling multi-location edits, requires generating significantly more tokens than simple fill-in-middle approaches. Initially, this put us way over our latency budget.However, there's a fascinating insight about how edit predictions work. When we rewrite a text snippet, the output often mirrors the input closely, with changes concentrated in specific spots. This pattern lets us parallelize token generation by using the input as a reference—a technique known as speculative decoding. We use n-gram search to identify promising jumping-off points in the input where we can start parallel token generation, giving us a significant speedup without sacrificing quality.For edit predictions to feel responsive, we needed to solve multiple latency challenges in parallel. As discussed above, we tackled the model execution time through speculative decoding, but serving the model at scale presented its own set of hurdles. This was by far the most compute-intensive problem our team has ever tackled.A few weeks out from launch, we ran a brief competitive process, and we ended up being really impressed with Baseten. Their performance engineers quickly optimized our open source model to run on their flexible infrastructure, achieving our target latencies while letting us retain full visibility into the details of the deployment, both for the Zed team and the entire Zed community. We plan to follow up with a guest post about what they learned optimizing our model.Latency is not just a function of compute; network transit time is a key driver of perceived speed. To cooperate with the laws of physics, we're launching with GPUs in both North America and Europe, and we hope to add more regions soon. We're also using Cloudflare Workers to handle your requests in a data center located as close to you as possible.There's plenty more to explore to make edit predictions more powerful. We'll be fast-following with more experiments. We plan on sending more kinds of context to the model and continuing our experiments with fine-tuning, and we'll share updates as we grow and evolve the Zeta dataset.We've learned a lot since we launched Zed AI last fall. The world is changing fast, and we're having a blast exploring and learning to build features that developers love. We're also excited to build with AI the Zed way. From our early days, we've been proponents of an open approach to building software, even when hard, and we see no reason to change that approach when it comes to working with AI. We hope you'll join us as a user, a contributor, or an employee, as we hustle to ship a golden future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Type safe Go money library</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ip4nxm/type_safe_go_money_library/</link><author>/u/HawkSecure4957</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:43:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, community I have been working on money library that is type safe, it's in beta and haven't been test against production.

There's an interesting theory out there that X causes Y. If this were true, it would be pretty important. So I did a deep-dive into the academic literature on whether X causes Y. Here's what I found.

(Embarrassingly, I can't actually remember what X and Y are. I think maybe X was enriched preschool, or just school itself, or eating fish while pregnant, or the Paleo diet, or lead exposure, or a clever "nudge" policy trying to get people to save more, or some self-help technique, or some micronutrient or public health intervention, or democracy, or free trade, or some approach to intellectual property law. And Y was ... lifetime earnings, or risk of ADHD diagnosis, or IQ in adulthood, or weight loss, or violent crime, or peaceful foreign policy, or GDP per capita, or innovation. Sorry about that! Hope you enjoy the post anyway! Fortunately, I think what I'm about to write is correct for pretty much any (X,Y) from those sorts of lists.)
There are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y, but most of them are simple observational studies that are just essentially saying "People/countries with more X also have more Y." For reasons discussed below, we can't really learn much from these studies.

There are 1-5 more interesting studies on whether X causes Y. Each study looks really clever, informative and rigorous at first glance. However, the more closely you look at them, the more confusing the picture gets.

We ultimately need to choose between (a) believing some overly complicated theory of the relationship between X and Y, which reconciles all of the wildly conflicting and often implausible things we're seeing in the studies; (b) more-or-less reverting to what we would've guessed about the relationship between X and Y in the absence of any research.
The chaff: lots of unhelpful studies that I'm disregarding
First, the good news: there are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y. The bad news? We need to throw most of them out. 

Many have comically small sample sizes (like studying 20 people) and/or comically short time horizons (like looking at weight loss over two weeks), or unhelpful outcome measures (like intelligence tests in children under 5). But by far the most common problem is that most of the studies on whether X causes Y are simple observational studies: they essentially just find that people/countries with more X also have more Y. 
Why is this a problem? There could be a  - some third thing, Z, that is correlated with both X and Y. And there are specific reasons we should expect confounders to be common:
In general, people/countries that have more X also have more of lots of other helpful things - they're richer, they're more educated, etc. For example, if we're asking whether higher-quality schooling leads to higher earnings down the line, an issue is that people with higher-quality schooling also tend to come from better-off families with lots of other advantages.

In fact, the very fact that people in upper-class intellectual circles think X causes Y means that richer, more educated people/countries tend to deliberately get more X, and also try to do a lot of other things to get more Y. For example, more educated families tend to eat more fish (complicating the attempt to see whether eating fish in pregnancy is good for the baby).
Now, a lot of these studies try to "control for" the problem I just stated - they say things like "We examined the effect of X and Y, while controlling for Z [e.g., how wealthy or educated the people/countries/whatever are]." How do they do this? The short answer is, well, hm, jeez. Well you see, to simplify matters a bit, just try to imagine ... uh ... shit. Uh. The only high-level way I can put this is:
They use a technique called regression analysis that, as far as I can determine, cannot be explained in a simple, intuitive way (especially not in terms of how it "controls for" confounders).

The "controlling for" thing relies on a lot of subtle assumptions and can break in all kinds of weird ways. Here's a technical explanation of some of the pitfalls; here's a set of deconstructions of regressions that break in weird ways.

None of the observational studies about whether X causes Y discuss the pitfalls of "controlling for" things and whether they apply here.

I don't think we can trust these papers, and to really pick them all apart (given how many there are) would take too much time. So let's focus on a smaller number of better studies.
The wheat: 1-5 more interesting studies
Digging through the sea of unhelpful studies, I found 1-5 of them that are actually really interesting! 

But on closer inspection, I have a bunch of reservations. For example:
The paper doesn't make it easy to replicate its analysis, and when someone does manage to sort-of replicate it, they may get different results. 

There was other weird stuff going on (e.g., changes in census data collection methods), during the strange historical event, so it's a little hard to generalize.

In a response to the study, another academic advances a complex theory of how the study could actually have gotten a misleading result. This led to an intense back-and-forth between the original authors and the skeptic, stretched out over years because each response had to be published in a journal, and by the time I got to the end of it I didn't have any idea what to think anymore.
I found 0-4 other interesting studies. I can't remember all of the details, but they may have included:

Compounding the problem, the 1-5 studies I found tell very different stories about the relationship between X and Y. How could this make sense? Is there a unified theory that can reconcile all the results?

Well, one possibility is that X causes Y sometimes, but only under very particular conditions, and the effect can be masked by some other thing going on. So - if you meet one of 7 criteria, you should do X to get more Y, but if you meet one of 9 other criteria, you should actually avoid X!

I have to say, this all was simultaneously more fascinating and less  than I expected it would be going in. I thought I would find some nice studies about the relationship between X and Y and be done. Instead, I've learned a ton about weird historical events and about the ins and outs of different measures of X and Y, but I feel just super confused about whether X causes Y.

I guess my bottom line is that X does cause Y, because it intuitively seems like it would.

I'm glad I did all this research, though. It's good to know that social science research can go haywire in all kinds of strange ways. And it's good to know that despite the confident proclamations of pro- and anti-X people, it's legitimately just super unclear whether X causes Y. 

I mean, how else could I have learned that?
Appendix: based on a true story
This piece was inspired by:

The basic patterns above apply to most of these, and the bottom line usually has the kind of frustrating ambiguity seen in this conclusion.There are cases where things seem a bit less ambiguous and the bottom line seems clearer. Speaking broadly, I think the main things that contribute to this are:
Actual randomization. For years I've nodded along when people say "You shouldn't be dogmatic about randomization, there are many ways for a study to be informative," but each year I've become a bit more dogmatic. Even the most sophisticated-, appealing-seeming alternatives to randomization in studies seem to have a way of falling apart. Randomized studies almost always have problems and drawbacks too. But I’d rather have a randomized study with drawbacks than a non-randomized study with drawbacks.

Extreme thoroughness, such as Roodman's attempt to reconstruct the data and code for key studies in Reasonable Doubt. This sometimes leads to outright dismissing a number of studies, leaving a smaller, more consistent set remaining.

Jan Christian Kaack, the inspector of the German navy, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the damage involved "more than one unit."Kaack also said there had been attempted break-ins at German naval bases via land and sea, and he spoke of "attempts to approach" uniformed personnel while they were heading home.The vice admiral didn't give further details on the sabotage attempts or explicitly say who was behind them.

It's scheduled for deployment to the Baltic Sea, the outlets reported.Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote that if the shavings hadn't been detected during an inspection, they would have caused significant damage to the ship.At Tuesday's press conference, Kaack was asked to address Süddeutsche Zeitung's report, but he didn't directly confirm the Emden incident when speaking about sabotage.The Emden is one of the five new K130 corvettes that Germany ordered for delivery in 2025 to fulfill its NATO requirements.Naval Vessels Lürssen, the company responsible for building the ships in Hamburg, told Agence France-Presse that the Emden had recently completed a "successful sea trial."It didn't respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.A spokesperson for the German navy told BI that the incident was still under investigation."So far, the 'Emden' is under construction and, therefore, owned by the manufacturing shipbuilding company," the spokesperson wrote in an email.Germany is already on high alert for sabotage attempts after multiple incidents in the past two years that include a package catching fire on a plane and a fire at an ammunition factory in Berlin.German authorities have repeatedly suggested that Russia is the prime suspect but are still investigating many of these cases.Ukraine's allies have accused Russia of waging a "hybrid war" against the West, with reports of an attempted assassination against a defense contractor CEO and the growing assessment that Russia-linked oil tankers damaged undersea infrastructure cables in the Baltic Sea.The Russian government didn't respond to a request for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours.February 13, 2025: This story was updated to reflect a statement from the German navy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TrueNAS 25.04 &quot;Fangtooth&quot; Beta Unifies Linux SCALE &amp; FreeBSD CORE Efforts</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/TrueNAS-25.04-Beta</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TrueNAS 25.04 beta was released on Thursday as another step toward unifying the TrueNAS CORE OS derived from FreeBSD and the Linux-based TrueNAS SCALE...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe warns against “dirty” Ukraine deal; Trump orders reciprocal tariffs, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/europe-warns-against-dirty-ukraine-deal-trump-orders-recipro</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/67aec547f7ed89241065bbd5/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk1MDY5NTY1MzUtYTlmNGUyZmQtMTBlZC00NWU4LTg2Y2UtOTQ5M2M0MWUxMzViLXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk1MDY5NjAzMzktN2I5NjdmNzMtNzE0YS00MDIyLThiYTEtMTRhNDU2OGQ2MWI5LXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=hXby-CeF0MYAwC4I01J3l3mixtaWKz77L84XbztT8EU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 04:23:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: AI Is Mapping Hidden Connections—And It’s Just Getting Started (2/14/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-14-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 03:56:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, February 14, 2025?By @andrei9735 [ 4 Min read ] From recommendation engines to network optimization, link prediction is a versatile tool that brings value.

This model is well motivated, as it not only accounts for DM but also explains neutrino oscillations. Hence, ALP-mediated RHN DM is interesting from both the model-building and phenomenological perspectives. We have considered the lightest RHN as DM, which is odd under Z2 symmetry, and identified the region of parameters where DM predictions are in agreement with DM relic abundance. In addition, this model also quite naturally explains the null results of LUX and XENON1T due to the pseudoscalar nature of interactions with quarks. We have highlighted the importance of complementary searches, for instance, via indirect detection with single and di-photons. Although the current limits from Fermi-LAT lie above the predicted signals for our choice of parameter space, future sensitivities of Fermi-LAT might offer promising prospects to probe both the low and high DM mass regions.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dark Matter Analysis: Relic Density, Direct Detection, and More</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/dark-matter-analysis-relic-density-direct-detection-and-more?source=rss</link><author>Phenomenology Technology</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 02:52:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The XENON1T [18] experiments have a strong sensitivity for spin-independent and spindependent DM-nucleon interactions in our interested mass range of DM.

The results are based on the work: Shivam Gola, Sanjoy Mondal, and Nita Sinha, "ALP portal majorana dark matter, Int.J.Mod.Phys.A 37 (2022) 22, 2250131”.The discovery of neutrino oscillations confirming the existence of at least two nonvanishing neutrino mass-squared differences necessitates physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In principle, neutrino mass could be simply generated by the addition of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to the SM particle content. These RHNs interact with SM fields via mixing with active neutrinos. Since RHNs are SM singlets, they allow the Majorana mass term along with the usual Dirac mass term. This is known as type-I seesaw mechanism [71–74]. The mass of these RHNs could range from eV to GUT scale, depending on the models [75–78]. RHNs can also play the role of warm dark matter (WDM), which is singlet under the SM gauge symmetry and has tiny mixing with the SM neutrinos, leading to a long lifetime [79–81]. Also, KeV-scale RHN has been studied as a viable DM candidate [82–84]. In this work, we have instead focused on the prospects of having GeV-scale RHNs as WIMP DM candidates.\
Chapter 2 is organised as follows: In Sec. 2.2, we introduced our model, detailing the new interactions present. In Sec. 2.3, we summarise the existing constraints on ALP parameter space coming from various observable and collider searches. In Sec. 4.4, we have explored and discussed the feasible parameter space coming from DM analyses, such as relic density and direct and indirect detection. Finally, we give our summary in Sec. 2.5.(1) Shivam Gola, The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RustOwl - A new tool for visualizing Rust lifetimes</title><link>https://youtu.be/NV6Xo_el_2o</link><author>/u/zxyzyxz</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 01:20:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Information Overload?

If you haven't guessed already, the cost of information consumption is time and attention - our two most limited resources - which are almost always better spent on the things that really matter in life: relationships, health, and fulfilling work. Most information consumption is an inefficient use of these resources considering the limited short-term memory we humans have; the vast majority of this information just gets absorbed into our subconscious, to reemerge blurred and convoluted by our emotions at the moment.I would even go as far as to say that generations past had it better because the information had more tangible costs: a $300 encyclopedia volume that took up an entire shelf in your living room, a 10-pound Yellow Pages directory, or hundreds of documents in a complicated filing system. The trouble of extracting knowledge from these forms of media meant that the seeker made sure it was going to be worth their while.Let's get practical here… \n As an entrepreneur and Applied Neuroscience Strategist, I make about $125/hour (more if I account for the continuity of my cryptocurrency investing and affiliate revenues). Since I'm fast, it takes me 15 minutes to skim a decent blog and watch a YouTube video on a subject (and remember the 80/20 principle; I probably need to skim more than this to learn what I need to).\
This has a finite  to me of about $32. \n I'm going to have to work overtime to cover the time spent consuming information, so it's cost me another 15 minutes that should be spent enjoying the life I'm working so damn hard for.Like you, I only have about 8-10 hours of productive mental energy a day. Active, applicable information consumption takes at least twice the mental energy of doing work (and sometimes, it's a much greater gap, depending upon what you do).Those 15 minutes cost me 30 minutes of mental energy; 30 minutes stolen from the energy that could have been devoted to actual work.\
Keep in mind that this example is for just 15 minutes of information consumption; sometimes, we spend hours a day!If I treat my time as money and my knowledge as potential power, it becomes clear that I need to get  above and beyond the value of the knowledge I am getting to cover the high cost of acquiring it. Whenever I engage in information consumption, I put myself in a position of information . I need to be selective about what I pay attention to…This is why I don't watch popular TV shows.I turn movies off after 30 minutes if they aren't amazing.\
We live in an interesting time where there is this massive disparity between the amount of information we can consume and the amount of time we have to do it. Our success, individually and culturally, over the next century will be decided not by the amount of knowledge we acquire but by our ability to leverage it.\
Anyway, enough philosophical mumbo jumbo (I hope you love it, you voracious consumer of information!) This article delves into practical ways to increase information equity…We’ve discussed the dynamic of information equity. Let’s now cover seven ways of increasing the equity and value you get from your information consumption, including task batching, mental segregation, and using memory triggers.\
How to increase information equity…\  Separate Your Work Into Two Categories…| Creative/mental energy-consuming tasks | Monotonous or repetitive tasks that require little mental energy |
|----|----|
| Examples: blogging, negotiating, sales calls, designing, meetings, strategizing, planning, communicating with other people, etc. | Examples: responding to emails, organizing paperwork, data entry, etc. |Plan your monotonous tasks at the end of the day when your mental energy is low and batch the most similar, monotonous tasks one after another. While you are doing this, consume information passively. Here are my top favorite forms of passive information consumption… – Which you download free from Apple Podcasts or Castbox.fm - my favorite podcast app.Watching documentary films – About history, science, travel, conspiracy theories - whatever I'm curious about at the moment. Top Documentary Films has +3000 documentary films, which you can watch for free.Online video (YouTube, Rumble, Odysee) - I'll create an hour or two-long playlist about whatever subject interests me. – If you don't want to pay for an Audible membership, the Castbox app has a huge library of public-domain audiobooks. Or you can use the excellent ElevenReader app to convert any PDF or Epub book into an audiobook; the AI narration is damn near the quality of a professional human narration.Sometime within the next month, you are going to be having a conversation with someone about blogging and you are going to use the phrase  (it’s going to make you seem really smart!) Here’s the memory trigger you are going to use…\
  : the word \
  : every time you hear the word  think  Then imagine a person’s mouth making an ‘O’ shape as they say *blah-blah-blah **> ***Now imagine a  inside their mouth (which is making a  shape)  That  represents the amount of information equity their blogging creates.\
  Reinforce the mental association: Mentally say the word , then mentally yell at yourself *BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! (*while visualizing the mouth). Do this 3 times (should take about 30 seconds).\
Initially, forming these memory triggers will feel a little odd and will take some mental energy and creativity, but as you do them more often, it will become natural and automatic.I highly recommend a top-down approach to your information consumption. Start with the end in mind; clearly identify a problem or issue you are having. Determine first whether it’s a definitive solution problem or an ambiguous solution problem. Here are some examples to illustrate the difference…\
Definitive Solution Problem: How do I set up a Facebook fan page?Ambiguous Solution Problem: How do I improve my online presence for my small business?\
For an ambiguous solution problem, I would use a forum or consultant and describe your problem specifically so you can get answers tailored to your specific situation.\
 - Quora is a forum-style website where you can post questions about a wide variety of topics. Often, you'll get responses to your questions from very well-educated people with years of relevant experience. I prefer to use forums like this to let the information I need come to me as opposed to chasing it. This can save a lot of time over searching blogs for what you need. Follow me here on Quora. - This is a hive of scum and villainy online, but there might be some decent subreddits devoted to the topic of your inquiry. Share your question in multiple subreddits that don't seem to be total "cults of the amateur."\
 - For nearly every topic under the sun, there are internet forums. Forums can actually be pretty decent places to connect with and question people who know what they are talking about. My favorite is the antiaging forum Longecity.org; connect with me there.*Mental Segregation Between Infotainment* and LearningWe spend an increasing amount of time-consuming information for pleasure. It’s important to put up a mental wall between the times of the day and hours that are spent on productive activities and the time that’s spent enjoying the life you are working so damn hard for. \
Infotainment during work hours will distract you from getting things done. So, make sure that information consumption during work hours is directly related to improving work.Do It, Delegate It, Dump ItWe all have dozens of activities on our mental to-do lists. It’s important to put these activities into three categories… – You should ideally have under five activities that you need to accomplish in a day. Schedule committed time to these activities. – Pass this activity off to someone who works for you or a colleague. – What’s the worst that could happen if you don’t do this activity? If it’s not that bad, dump it.Find a partner who holds you accountable for following through on finishing the things you start. Let your accountability partner know you have invested your time in information consumption and commit to them that you will do whatever it takes to follow through.Practice Discipline and Persistence!Did you think this blog was just about shortcuts and clever ways of hacking life? Nope! Whenever you consume knowledge, make a mental commitment to yourself that you will put this knowledge to valuable use. Make sure you have a specific plan to do so, and then follow through! \n ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Bombing of Dresden</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-bombing-of-dresden</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67acbf38b468a1d76f07cfe4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=4t-ogoVsYhBL5G4XkWv7VG90QBldYnzKndFl63Zs2Qk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the Second World War neared its bloody climax, Allied bombers unleashed a devastating firestorm on Dresden.

This new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a  resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a  resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.
It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Laughing Kremlin Insiders Say Trump Has Given Putin Greenlight to Expand the War</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/laughing-kremlin-insiders-say-trump-has-given-putin-greenlight-to-expand-the-war/</link><author>/u/soldierofcinema</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 23:17:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jottr, simple text editor for distraction-free writing</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iow7od/jottr_simple_text_editor_for_distractionfree/</link><author>/u/walterblackkk</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 23:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jottr is a simple, opinionated, plain text editor I developed primarily for my personal use.

They say fusion is 50 years away, no matter when you ask. Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.

From the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome’s port city of Ostia to local shrines and colossal structures like the Pantheon, the ancient Romans worshipped a pantheon of gods, some local and others imported from across the Mediterranean.

One key feature of Roman religion was its ability to adapt and innovate. New gods were welcomed into the Roman pantheon, often from the peoples Rome conquered or traded with, such as the Egyptian goddess Isis, who became immensely popular by the Imperial period and received a large temple in the Campus Martius. Another example is Mithras, a mysterious god with Persian origins whose worship involved secret underground rituals and appealed particularly to Roman soldiers.

Public temples were monumental structures that marked sacred spaces. They served both religious and practical functions, often housing libraries, halls, and spaces for the public to gather. Temples were dedicated to the well-being of the state, such as the Temple of Saturn, which doubled as the city treasury, or the Temple of Castor and Pollux, linked to military victories.

Privacy Pass is an authentication protocol first introduced by Davidson  in [1], and recently standardized by the IETF as RFCs [2—4].  Our starting point was the excellent Rust implementation of the Privacy Pass protocols by Raphael Roberts. At the same time, we are announcing the immediate availability of Kagi’s Tor onion service.In general terms, Privacy Pass allows “Clients” (generally users) to authenticate to “Servers” (like Kagi) in such a way that while the Server can verify that the connecting Client has the right to access its services, it cannot determine which of its rightful Clients is actually connecting. This is particularly useful in the context of a privacy-respecting paid search engine, where the Server wants to ensure that the Client can access the services, and the Client seeks strong guarantees that, for example, the searches are not associated with them.As a privacy-respecting search engine, Kagi’s business model is such that we have no incentive to track what an individual user is searching for. We are in the business of selling a search product, not selling user data or attention.Now, Privacy Pass adds another layer of trust: we can verify that you have the right to search without knowing who you are or what you’re searching for. It’s one thing to promise we won’t track you; it’s another to make it technically impossible. We jumped on the opportunity to implement Privacy Pass as soon as the IETF made it an official standard.This matters, because for many users, privacy isn’t just about incentives and privacy policies; it’s about proof. When we cannot track you even if we wanted to, that’s genuine privacy.Initially, we will be offering Privacy Pass to all our plans with unlimited searches: Professional, Ultimate, Family, and Team plans. Privacy Pass will not be available to Trial and Starter plans due to technical limitations at this moment (see below for more info).
To get started with Kagi Privacy Pass right away:Download the newest version of Kagi’s Orion Browser (for macOS/iOS/iPadOS) with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need at least 0.99.131 for macOS and 1.3.17 for iOS/iPadOS (they are expected to be rolling out globally today).Download the newest version of Kagi for Android app with Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated. You will need to use at least version 0.29 (this is expected to roll out globally today).If you are already using the Kagi Search extension, you will want to update it to the latest version (0.7.6 on Firefox, 1.2.2.5 on Chrome) to avoid compatibility issues, or simply disable it.Safari is not yet supported due to technical limitations, see the F.A.Q. below.In addition our implementation of Privacy Pass is open sourced and you can find it here.When using Kagi Privacy Pass mode, you’ll be truly anonymous - which means your account settings won’t be available since we can’t identify which user you are.But don’t worry - we’ve made it flexible. You can easily toggle Privacy Pass on or off based on your needs. Think of it as two modes: full features with normal privacy, or maximum privacy with core features. You choose what makes sense for you based on your context and needs.Privacy Pass uses cryptography to allow a client to authenticate to a server by performing a protocol with two phases: token generation and token redemption.In the initial “token generation” phase, the client interacts with the server to generate some authentication “tokens.”For the server to willingly participate in this protocol, the client must prove their “right” to generate tokens.In the case of Kagi’s users, this can be done by presenting their Kagi session cookie to the server.The tokens eventually generated by the client at the end of this phase are indistinguishable from a randomly generated token from the server’s point of view. They cannot be traced back to the user who generated them, or to other tokens generated by the same user at the same or a different time.After token generation is performed, a client can initiate a “token redemption” phase.During this phase, the client actually accesses the services provided by the server, proving the client’s right to access the services by presenting one of the previously generated tokens.Since the previously generated tokens are unknown and unpredictable to the server, the latter can only tell that the client has successfully completed token generation at some point.Technically, we say that the techniques used by Privacy Pass result in the two phases being “unlinkable”. While the server is able to tell whether a token presented for redemption was previously generated by interacting with a rightful client, it cannot link the token to a specific token generation phase.Crucially, tokens are single-use: servers keep track of which tokens have already been redeemed to avoid multiple redemptions. Furthermore, clients should not present the same token twice to prevent different redemption phases from being linked.Tokens have a fixed life span. If they are too old, they will stop being redeemable. In that case, a new token generation phase must be initiated by the client to obtain new tokens.As standardized in [2 - 4], the Privacy Pass protocol is able to accommodate many “architectures.” Our deployment model follows the original architecture presented by Davidson  [1], called “Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer” in § 4 of [2].Here, Kagi plays all the “Server roles” (Attester, Issuer, Origin), and Kagi users play the Client role via the new Kagi browser extensions for Privacy Pass, or via native support in Orion. This is what it looks like in practice:Once installed, and periodically, the browser extension will generate and store a large number of tokens.The user can mark in the extension whether searches should be performed by authenticating classically via a session cookie, or by using Privacy Pass.If the user chooses the second option, they will authenticate to Kagi during the search by redeeming one of the tokens it previously generated.Using Privacy Pass is as easy as clicking a toggle.If you are using the latest version of Orion for macOS,  select Kagi as your search engine in  and then enable the checkbox for showing Privacy Pass options on your toolbar.From there you can easily toggle when you want to use Privacy Pass or standard authentication.On iOS and iPadOS, Kagi Privacy Pass is natively supported in the latest version of the Orion Browser for iOS and iPadOS and takes just a few clicks to enable.Our Android app now supports Privacy Pass mode via an app shortcut. Launching the shortcut allows you to browse Kagi seamlessly in Privacy Pass mode. You can also add the shortcut to your home screen for quick access.This feature lets you either use Kagi exclusively in Privacy Pass mode or switch effortlessly between modes.Chrome and Firefox browser extensionsIf you are using the Kagi Privacy Pass extension for Chrome or Firefox, once installed you should see the Kagi Privacy Pass icon on your toolbar.Once installed, the extension automatically generates tokens. To use them, click the extension icon, and make sure the toggle is on.Note that Safari is not supported at this moment; see the F.A.Q. below for more information.As used by Kagi, Privacy Pass tokens offer various security properties (§ 3.3,  of [2]).These can be a little technical to capture. In a few words, they guarantee that users can trust that their searches authenticated via Privacy Pass cannot be linked to their accounts, and Kagi can rest assured that only legitimate users can correctly authenticate using Privacy Pass. Crucially, the guarantee for users is even against malicious servers that attempt to incorrectly implement the server-side computation, as long as the client-side implementation is correct.Three of these security properties serve to protect our users:Generation-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during token redemption ( during search) with any specific token generation phase. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell who it is serving search results to, only that it is someone who presented a valid Privacy Pass token.Redemption-redemption unlinkability: Kagi cannot link the tokens presented during two different token redemptions. This means that Kagi will not be able to tell from tokens alone whether two searches are being performed by the same user.No redemption hijacking: an eavesdropper that observes any token generation phase, cannot use the observed information alone to “steal” the tokens from the intended user and redeem them themselves. This means that third parties snooping on a user’s token generation interaction will not be able to steal the tokens. This adds a layer of security on top of the confidentiality attained during token generation by using a TLS-protected connection.Two of these security properties serve to protect Kagi.Correctness: honestly generated tokens will pass Kagi’s validation.One-more-forgery security: a malicious client cannot use knowledge of a correctly generated token to forge a new one. This means that valid tokens cannot be generated without correctly interacting with Kagi, and therefore valid tokens are evidence that the user owned a valid session cookie for a supported Kagi plan at the moment of generating the token.Naturally, online interactions are never fully described by a mathematical model.While the Privacy Pass protocol  indeed guarantee that the server will not be able to link token generation and token redemption phases , in principle, a malicious server could still attempt to track clients via side-channel information.For example, if someone were to make the same specific request to a server at the same time every day (say, searching “lunch places near 123 Mulholland Drive, LA” at 11:58 AM), a server that records all searches being made could, in principle, guess that these searches are all made by the same person.In this case, Privacy Pass would make it harder for the server to determine who this specific person is, but the server could nonetheless link searches to one another.On a level beyond, it is well known that browsers can often have a unique “fingerprint” [5-7]. Fingerprinting attacks heavily rely on side-channel signals that evade the Privacy Pass protocol, such as user-agent strings or IP addresses. For example, if a server receives a token generation request from a given IP address, and immediately after a token redemption request from the same address, it can likely conclude that the same individual is behind the request. For this reason, it is highly recommended to separate token generation and redemption in time, or “in space” (by using an anonymizing service such as Tor when redeeming tokens, see below).Kagi’s Privacy Pass extension and native implementation in Orion take care, as much as we can, to uniform your browser fingerprint, by removing deanonymizing HTTP headers and cookies.We see Privacy Pass as an important tool for increasing the anonymity guarantees we can offer to Kagi users.Adopting state-of-the-art standards for new privacy enhancing technologies also signals to researchers and standardization bodies that there is a public demand for more privacy and anonymity tools in today’s digital world and incentivizes further scrutiny and development of privacy-enhancing technologies.Together with launching Privacy Pass, we are also announcing that we now have a Tor onion service available, which allows access to Kagi directly from the Tor network. Kagi’s onion address is:On its own, Tor will obscure your location by hiding your IP address. However, without Privacy Pass, you still need to be logged into your Kagi account to perform searches, making them all theoretically linkable back to a single account. As always, Kagi does not link searches to accounts or permanently record them; see our Privacy Policy for more info.With Tor and Privacy Pass together, Kagi only knows that the search is being issued by a user who previously verified that they have an account authorized to receive tokens, but nothing about the user’s account, or where they’re located.Privacy Pass support is provided:This should accommodate users who want to install and use the extension across multiple browsers or computers. Please refer to our documentation for usage instructions.At first, Privacy Pass authentication will be available to users on any Kagi plan with unlimited searches. These plans will have a generous allocation of tokens (2000 to begin with) that they can generate monthly.We are working on enabling this feature for Trial and Starter plans, which have access to a limited number of monthly searches. Therefore, they risk a worse user experience if their generated tokens are lost (for example, due to uninstalling the extension) and theoretically, users on this plan could redeem more tokens than the limit of searches allowed on their plan (again, we do not know who the user redeeming the tokens is, or what plan they are on). This makes it more technically challenging to support these plans with Privacy Pass, and we have left that for later.You mention “tokens.” Are blockchains involved in this protocol?Privacy Pass does not rely on any blockchain technology.While the protocol makes use of various cryptographic primitives (specifically, elliptic curves and hash functions, as part of a “verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function” construction, [8]) and generates “tokens,” these are not generated, stored, or traded on a blockchain.You mention the client generating tokens. Is this process energy-intensive or storage-demanding?No. The generation of 500 search tokens requires approximately 1 second of computation on a consumer laptop, and is performed in the background when installing the extension. A few extra seconds may be required due to the time required to contact the server and get a response. Each token consists of 216 bytes, for a total of approximately 100 KiB of storage per token generation request.Is there a potential impact on the speed of search when using Privacy Pass?The initial generation of tokens takes about ~1 second for 500 tokens, plus the time required for contacting the server. This occurs infrequently and is done in the background when possible.Currently, the token validation servers are only deployed in our us-central1 region, we plan to expand this shortly after launch.How many tokens am I able to generate?You can generate 2,000 tokens in one “epoch” (= one month). This should be enough for most users. If you need more than this, you can request additional tokens by contacting support@kagi.com.Do you plan to allow purchasing privacy pass tokens without having an account?Yes, this makes sense. This is possible because technically the extension does not care if you have an account or not. It just needs to be ‘loaded’ with valid tokens. And you can imagine a mechanism where you could also anonymously purchase them, eg. with monero, without ever creating an account at Kagi.  Let us know here if you are excited about this, as it will help prioritize it.How can I submit feedback for Kagi Privacy Pass?We have a feedback thread open here.Even if the extension implements anti-fingerprinting measures, Kagi will still be able to see my IP address, correct?Even with Privacy Pass authentication enabled, due to the way the TCP/IP stack works, we will be able to see your search request come from an IP address. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, your privacy is our priority, whether you are using Privacy Pass to authenticate or otherwise. If you are worried about us seeing your IP address, our suggestion is to connect to Kagi via Tor or through a VPN service you trust.How can Privacy Pass increase my privacy, if I have to send a session cookie to authenticate during token generation?While token generation is indeed not anonymous, Privacy Pass provides you with anonymity .By providing the server with a Privacy Pass token instead of a session cookie when searching, you will guarantee that your searches cannot be  to any specific user account that generated Privacy Pass tokens, or to each other.From the point of view of the server, your search query could have come from any of the users who previously generated Privacy Pass tokens.The more users do so, the lower the probability that the server can guess it was you specifically who made a given search query.Token generation does not work in my Chrome/Firefox private windowCorrect, we need to authenticate you to create tokens (see above), and in the private window, the extension does not have access to your session cookie. Please use a normal browsing window while logged in to Kagi to generate tokens.Note, generating tokens while in a private window will work in the Orion browser.Can I use Kagi Assistant while using Privacy Pass?Not at this time, since Kagi Assistant is only available to Ultimate members. In Privacy Pass, we don’t have any account information, so we can’t validate what plan you’re on. We could issue tokens attached to different keys for different plans, but that also has privacy implications, see the discussion of personalization below.What Kagi services will be compatible with Privacy Pass at launch?At launch, Privacy Pass will only be used to authenticate Kagi Search. Soon to follow (in the next few weeks), we plan to expand support for Kagi Privacy Pass to:Kagi Translate and Kagi MapsKagi universal Summarizer and Ask questions about pagePlease disable Privacy pass to access these services for now.Since initial token generation happens in batches and the tokens expire, could tokens with similar expiration dates potentially be used to identify multiple searches from the same user?All tokens generated during month X expire at midnight of the first day of month X+2, to avoid this exact issue. Meaning a freshly generated token lasts until the end of the month following its generation (generate today, use all of Feb and March).If Kagi cannot track who exactly is performing search queries, will I have access to my account settings including customization and personalization?Since Kagi will not know who you are, we will not be able to serve you content tailored to your custom settings via Privacy Pass-protected search.We have considered allowing users to send a small configuration with every request (language, region, safe-search) to automatically customize your search experience to some extent. However, we currently believe this would quickly result in a significant loss of anonymity for you and for other users. To illustrate this, we have examined the most common configurations of (language, region, search-safe) used on Kagi.com, and extrapolated how many Privacy Pass users would share them. Looking at the top 35 configurations, we see the following approximate numbers.Limiting the analysis to only the ten most common language settings, the effect is similar:This would mean that someone sending us  as their language configuration would automatically lose redemption-redemption unlinkability guarantees if approximately 1000 Kagi users used Privacy Pass.While our extrapolation may be overly conservative, we won’t be enabling this level of “default” customization for users authenticating via Privacy Pass for the time being. We could reconsider if we find a better solution.For manual search settings customization, you can always use bangs in your search query to enable basic settings for a specific query. For example, regional bangs will let you focus your query on one region. For example prefixing your search with  will automatically search in the German region.To access a fully customized search experience, you can always use the traditional login method and disable the use of Privacy Pass.Will Safari be supported?The Safari extensions API doesn’t support (as far as we know) removing cookies from requests, which means it will always authenticate with your logged-in account. We’re not aware of a way to change this. The alternative if you want a similar, native, WebKit-based browsing experience, is to use the Orion Browser which has Kagi Privacy Pass natively integrated.Davidson, A., Goldberg, I., Sullivan, N., Tankersley, G., & Valsorda, F.

Hidden away since his death, they chart his life on the front during the first world war where he served on the western front against the French and English from 1914 to 1918. 

Writing on the morning of the 11th November, Wilhelm reveals in depth his and his comrades feelings and thoughts about the armistice - giving us never before heard insight into those final moments.

His letters and diaries from 1929 onwards reveal the rise of Hitler and the Nazis and his own involvement and ultimately the defeat of Nazi Germany and his own experience of the denazification process.

I failed the next five interviews as well before finally landing my first job at .Since then, I’ve interviewed with many companies and faced my fair share of rejections. However, over the years, my failure rate in coding interviews dropped significantly.By 2022, with just 1.5 months of focused preparation, I successfully cleared interviews at  and .Surprisingly, my success wasn’t due to a dramatic improvement in problem-solving skills. The real game-changer was my approach— and  during the interview.In this article, I’ll share  that made coding interviews significantly easier for me.These tips cover everything you need to know, including:How to systematically approach coding interview problemsKey concepts and patterns you should knowThe type of problems you should practiceHow to choose the right algorithm for a given problemTechniques to optimize your solutionHow to communicate your thought process effectivelyBy applying these strategies, you’ll be able to tackle coding interviews with confidence and massively increase your chances of success.In a coding interview, interviewers want to see how well you , , and  under pressure.Here's a breakdown of what they look for:Understanding the problem: Do you ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions to ensure you fully understand the problem?: Can you decompose the problem into smaller, manageable parts?: Can you design an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity?: Do you handle edge cases like empty inputs, duplicates, large values, or special conditions?: Can you explain why one approach is better than another?: Do you have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, and can you choose the right one for the problem?Can you quickly compute the time and space complexity of your solution?Explaining your thought process: Can you clearly articulate your approach and why it works?: Are you receptive to hints and able to adjust your approach accordingly?: Do you follow good coding practices (meaningful variable names, proper indentation, modular functions etc..)?Improving the initial solution: Can you optimize and refine your first solution when prompted?Are you able to tackle variations of the original problem?Can you manually walk through your code with sample inputs to verify correctness?Most coding interviews last Depending on the company and interviewer, you may be asked to solve 2-3easy/medium problems or 1 hard problem with follow-ups.Lets assume you are given one problem, with a follow up in a 45-minute interview. Here’s how you can optimally allocate your time:The interviewer may ask you to introduce yourself. Prepare a concise 1-2 minute introduction that highlights your background, experience, and key strengths. Practice it beforehand so that you can deliver it smoothly.Understand the Problem (5-10 mins):  Carefully read the problem statement, ask clarifying questions, and walk through sample inputs and expected outputs.Plan the Approach (10-20 mins): Brainstorm possible solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and discuss time and space complexity.Implement the Code (20-30 mins): Write a clean, modular and readable code.Dry-run your code with sample inputs, debug any issues, and ensure edge cases are handled.Follow-ups and Wrap Up (35-45 mins): Answer follow up questions, and ask thoughtful questions to the interviewer about the company, role, or team.One of the biggest mistakes candidates make in coding interviews is jumping into coding too soon.If you don't fully understand the question, you might end up solving the Here’s how to ensure you grasp the problem before coding:Read the Problem CarefullyTake a moment to absorb the problem statement. Rephrase it in your own words to confirm your understanding. Identify the expected input/output format and any hidden constraints.If anything is unclear, ask questions before diving into the solution. Interviewers appreciate when you seek clarity. Never assume details that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.Common clarifications include:Are there duplicate values?Can the input be empty? If so, what should the output be?Should the solution handle negative numbers?Should the output maintain the original order of elements?Is the graph directed or undirected?Does the input contain only lowercase English letters, or can it have uppercase, digits, or special characters?What should happen if multiple solutions exist? Should I return any valid solution, or does the problem have specific requirements?Walk Through Input/Output ExamplesOnce you understand the problem statement and constraints, go over a few input and output examples to make sure you get it.Draw them out if it helps, especially for visual data structures like trees or graphs.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios of the problem. Think about any  that might come up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If a frozen Ice Age puppy is a pupsicle, is a frozen kitten a cubsicle?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGe4GxuAtqE</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cGe4GxuAtqE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

Its canopy of leaves, almost 50 meters high, towers over the crowns of the forest. The tree shapes the myths of the indigenous Wayana people.

With over 80,000 plant species and hundreds of thousands of animal species, the Amazon rainforest is a green ocean of life. In the midst of this ecosystem, the kapok tree provides both shelter and crucial spaces for reproduction. Numerous animal species could not survive without the kapok tree. 
Dragonflies and damselflies buzz around the spines on its trunk to lay their larvae in the bromeliad ‘air plants’ that grow on the tree. Here, the smallest influences the largest - and vice versa. Bromeliad plants do double duty, acting as floating water reservoirs: they store up to 50,000 liters of water per hectare of forest.

When the forest floor is under water during the rainy season, the fish become gardeners. They feed on the seeds that have fallen from the trees and spread them all over the Amazon region. The kapok tree is firmly anchored in the ground with its huge roots until the next dry season. The whole forest breathes, from the moss on the ground to the treetops. This gas exchange makes life on earth possible. But dangers such as deforestation and climate change threaten this unique ecosystem.

Some of them could make it more important than ever.The open-source office suite had its own program stream at FOSDEM, including the pre-announcement of the new LibreOffice release 25.2. It has been around in some form since 1985, so this version marks its 40th year. It's middle-aged and, almost inevitably, that means it's big, a bit saggy in places, it definitely has some issues, and it doesn't look as good as it did a couple of decades ago.But that doesn't mean it can't be taught interesting things. Even a 40-year-old can acquire new skills and take on entirely new roles.It's the same sort of functionality that you get from Google Docs, and indeed this is already possible using the Collabora Online web-based version of LibreOffice. The big difference is that such tools run in a browser, so you need to be online. What makes the CRDT implementation different is that this is a local app, working on a local file, but using a network copy to keep changes in sync. The idea is to free you from keeping your apps and data on someone else's computer, without losing the handy collaborative features that web apps bring.We also met up with Thorsten for a demo of one of his other babies, ZetaOffice. This is a version of LibreOffice built for the Wasm runtime, which means it can run inside a browser. He demonstrated it to us on an AMD Ryzen-powered developer-spec ThinkPad, but the same binaries could run on any OS and on any CPU, such as ARM hardware. ZetaOffice went into public beta last November, and a first release is looming very soon.He showed us it running in multiple modes. You can embed any of the LibreOffice apps into a web page, complete with their normal user interface and so on, much like Google Apps. This enables a website to offer a very rich editing experience of text, spreadsheets, presentations, or anything else. ZetaOffice can also be embedded, scripted, and controlled using the zetajs wrapper, so you can call it to display embedded rich objects in web pages. We were rather taken by a demo that displayed a moving line chart of ping times to the  website. A script was extracting the times from the ping command, adding lines to a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, graphing the last dozen or so lines and embedding the graph in a web page.He told us that the Allotropia development team sees ZetaOffice as orthogonal to Collabora Office (or COOL for short). COOL runs in the browser and has simultaneous multiuser editing. ZetaOffice runs in the browser too, but it's perfectly able to run locally and doesn't need an uplink. For now, though, it's single user. The company will make a cross-platform version that is also available for local installation.The real power comes from the scriptability and integration with JavaScript, though. We are sure lots of people will find uses for the ability to embed any document LibreOffice can open into any web page, control and automate it from JavaScript, with the choice of a full local user interface – or none, just the content, controlled with a JavaScript UI instead. The code is all under the MIT licence, so it's all-FOSS, and all the work is being upstreamed to LibreOffice itself.This is big stuff in more than one way. LibreOffice isn't lightweight anyway. Opening a document in a web page can pull in a gigabyte or so of code, and the memory footprint is a bit more than that. It is still in beta, though, and the team is working hard on modularizing the code into multiple smaller chunks so that it will load much faster and take less memory.The potential flexibility here is impressive, though. You could have a portable app on a USB key that was usable on a PC or Mac or Chromebook, regardless of the OS, without installation. Web apps suddenly acquire full rich cross-platform document handling and editing, including, of course, all the main Microsoft files and formats.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Save the Cows</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVSGSQQenSE</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bVSGSQQenSE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:58:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Should we get rid of pregnancy?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0rWp3GF_6s</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/h0rWp3GF_6s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ada imagines a life where she could have children without giving birth. Would artificial wombs give us more choice or less?

--

This is episode 3 of the animated series, “Ada.” This 5-episode narrative follows the young library assistant Ada as she juggles two worlds: her daily mundane reality and the future she vividly imagines for all humanity. Traveling through her visions of potential futures, Ada grapples with the ethical and social implications of new technologies and how they could shape the world.

Abstract objects, like numbers and logic, give God problems. Because they always exist and exist necessarily, abstract objects cannot be created or destroyed. But could God have created abstract objects? If so, how? If not, God would no longer be all-powerful and 100 percent sovereign, as theology requires, because he would not have created everything that exists.

At the time, I worked on software (people call them “jailbreaks” these days) to allow users to run their own unofficial apps on the Nintendo Wii.I was passionate about my work and the team I was part of (Team Twiizers, later fail0verflow). Despite that, I ended up burning out, primarily due to the very large fraction of entitled users. Most people using our software just wanted to play pirated games (something we did not support, condone, or directly enable). We kept playing a cat and mouse game with the manufacturer to keep the platform open, only to see our efforts primarily used by people who just wanted to steal other people’s work, and very loudly felt entitled to it. It got really old after a while. As newer game consoles were released, I ended up focusing on Linux ports purely for fun, and didn’t attempt to build a community nor work on the jailbreaks/exploits that would end up becoming a tool used by pirates.When Apple released the M1, I realized that making it run Linux was my dream project. The technical challenges were the same as my console homebrew projects of the past (in fact, much bigger), but this time, the platform was already open - there was no need for a jailbreak, and no drama and entitled users who want to pirate software to worry about. And running Linux on an M1 was a  bigger deal than running it on a PS4.I launched the Asahi Linux project, and received an immense amount of support and donations. Incredibly, I had the support I needed to make the project happen just a few days after my call to action, so I got to work. The first couple of years were amazing, as we brought the platform from nothing to one of the smoothest Linux experiences you can get on a laptop. Sure, there were/are still some bits and pieces of hardware support missing, but the overall experience rivaled or exceeded what you could get on most x86 laptops. And we built it all from scratch, with zero vendor support or documentation. It was an impossible feat, something that had never been done before, and we pulled it off.Unfortunately, things became less fun after a while. First, there were the issues upstreaming code to the Linux kernel, which I’ve already spoken at length about and I won’t repeat here. Suffice it to say, being in a position to have to upstream code across practically every Linux subsystem, touching drivers of all categories as well as some common code, is an  frustrating experience.But then also came the entitled users. This time, it wasn’t about stealing games, it was about features. “When is Thunderbolt coming?” “Asahi is useless to me until I can use monitors over USB-C” “The battery life sucks compared to macOS” (nobody ever complained when compared to x86 laptops…) “I can’t even check my CPU temperature” (yes, I seriously got that one).And, of course, “When is M3/M4 support coming?”For a long time, well after we had a stable release, people kept claiming Asahi Linux and Fedora Asahi Remix in particular were “alpha” and “unstable” and “not suitable for a daily driver” (despite thousands of users, myself included, daily driving it and even using it for servers).No matter how much we did, how many impossible feats we pulled off, people always wanted more. And more. Meanwhile, donations and pledges kept slowly , and have done so since the project launched. Not enough to spell immediate doom for my dream of working on Asahi full time in the short term, but enough to make me wonder if any of this was really appreciated. The all-time peak monthly donation volume was the very first month or two. It seemed the more things we accomplished, the less support we had.I knew burnout was a very real risk and managed this by limiting my time spent on certain areas, such as kernel upstreaming. This worked reasonably well and was mostly sustainable at the time.Then 2024 happened. Last year was incredibly tumultuous for me due to personal reasons which I won’t go into detail about. Suffice it to say, I ended up traveling for most of the year, all the while having to handle various abusers and stalkers who harassed and attacked me and my family (and continue to do so).I did make some progress in 2024, but this left me in a very vulnerable position. I hadn’t gotten nearly as much Asahi work done as I’d liked, and the users weren’t getting any quieter about demanding more features and machine support.We shipped conformant Vulkan drivers and a whole emulation stack for x86-64 games and apps, but we were still stuck without DP Alt Mode (a feature which required deep reverse engineering, debugging, and kernel surgery to pull off, and which, if it were to be implemented properly and robustly, would require a major refactor of certain kernel subsystems or perhaps even the introduction of an entirely new subsystem).I slowly started to ramp work up again at the beginning of this year, feeling very stressed out and guilty about having gotten very little work done for the previous year. “Full” DP Alt support was still a ways away, but we were hoping to ship a limited version that only worked on a specific Type C port for each machine type in the first month or two of the year. Sven had gotten some progress into the PHY code in December, so I picked it up and ended up beating the code of three drivers into enough shape that it mostly worked reliably. Even though it wasn’t the best approach, it was the most I could manage without having another huge bikeshed discussion with the kernel community (I did try to bring the subject up on the mailing lists, but it didn’t get much response).The issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership. Such a large project needs significant support from major stakeholders to survive, while his approach seems to have been to just wait and see. Meanwhile, multiple subsystem maintainers downstream of him have done their best to stonewall or hinder the project, issue unacceptable verbal abuse, and generally hurt morale, with no consequence. One major Rust for Linux maintainer already resigned a few months ago.As you know, this is deeply personal to me, as we’ve made a bet on Rust for Linux for Asahi. Not just for fun (or just for memory safety), either: Rust is the entire reason our GPU driver was able to succeed in the time it did. We have two more Rust drivers in our downstream tree now, and a third one on track to be rewritten from C to Rust, because Rust is simply much better suited to the unique challenges we face, and the C driver is becoming unmaintainable. This is, by the way, the same reason the new Nova driver for Nvidia GPUs is being written in Rust. More modern programming languages are better suited to writing drivers for more modern hardware with more complexity and novel challenges, unsurprisingly.Some might be wondering why we can’t just let the Rust situation play out on its own over a longer period of time, perhaps several more years, and simply maintain things downstream until then. One reason is that, of course, this situation is hurting developer morale in the present. Another is that our Apple GPU driver is itself major evidence that Rust for Linux is fit for purpose (it was the first big driver to be written from scratch in Rust and brought along with it lots of development in Rust kernel abstractions). Simply not aiming for upstream might be seen as lack of interest, and hurt the chances of survival of the Rust for Linux effort. But there’s more.In fact, the Linux kernel development model is (perhaps paradoxically) designed to encourage upstreaming and punish downstream forks. While it is possible to just not care about upstream and maintain an outright hard fork, this is not a viable long-term solution (that’s how you get vendor Android kernel trees that die off in 2 years). The Asahi Linux downstream tree is continuously rebased on top of the latest upstream kernel, and that means that every extra patch we carry downstream increases our maintenance workload, sometimes significantly. But it goes deeper than that: Kernel/Mesa policy states that upstream Mesa support for a GPU driver cannot be merged and enabled until the kernel side is ready for merge. This means that we also have to ship a Mesa fork to users. While our GPU driver is 99% upstreamed into Mesa, it is intentionally hard-disabled and we are not allowed to submit a change that would enable it until the kernel side lands. This, in practice, means that users cannot have GPU acceleration work together with container technologies (such as Docker/Podman, but also including things like Waydroid), since standard container images will ship upstream Mesa builds, which would not be compatible. We have a partial workaround for Flatpak, but all other container systems are out of luck. Due to all this and more, the difficulty of upstreaming to the Linux kernel is hurting our downstream users today.I’m not the kind to let injustices go when I see them, so when yet another long-term maintainer abused his position to attempt to hinder R4L and block upstreaming progress, I spoke out. And the response (which has been pretty widely covered) was the last drop that put me over the edge. I resigned from my position as an upstream maintainer for Apple ARM support, as I no longer want to be involved with that community. Later in that thread, another major maintainer unironically stated “We
are the ‘thin blue line’”, and nobody cared, which just further confirmed to me that I don’t want to have anything to do with them. This is the same person that previously prompted a Rust for Linux maintainer to quit.But it goes well beyond the public incident. In the days that followed, I learned that some members of the kernel and adjacent Linux spaces have been playing a two-faced game with me, where they feigned support for me and Asahi Linux while secretly resenting me and rallying resentment behind closed doors. All this occurred without anyone ever sending me any private email or otherwise clueing me into what was going on. I heard that one of these people, one who has a high level position in multiple projects that Asahi Linux must interact with to survive, had sided with and continues to side with individuals who have abused and harassed me directly. Apparently there were also implied falsehoods, such as the idea that I am employed by someone to work on Asahi (I am not, we have zero corporate sponsorship other than bunny.net giving us free CDN credits for the hosting).I get that some people might not have liked my Mastodon posts. Yes, I can be abrasive sometimes, and that is a fault I own up to. But this is simply not okay. I cannot work with people who form cliques behind the scenes and lie about their intentions. I cannot work with those who place blame on the messenger, instead of those who are truly toxic in the community. I cannot work with those who resent public commentary and claim things are better handled in private despite the fact that nothing ever seems to change in private. I cannot work with those who denounce calling out misbehavior on social media to thousands of followers, while themselves roasting people both on social media and on mailing lists with thousands of subscribers. I cannot work with those in high-level positions who use politically charged and discriminatory language in public and face no repercussions. I cannot work with those who say I’m the problem and everything is going great, while major supporters and maintainers are actively resigning and I keep receiving messages from all kinds of people saying they won’t touch the Linux kernel with a 10-foot pole.When Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds wished it could run Linux, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him an invitation to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenace and see how we could help. He never replied.Back in 2011, Con Kolivas left the Linux kernel community. An anaesthetist by day, he was arguably the last great Linux kernel hobbyist hacker. In the years since it seems things have, if anything, only gotten worse. Today, it is practically impossible to survive being a significant Linux maintainer or cross-subsystem contributor if you’re not employed to do it by a corporation. Linux started out as a hobbyist project, but it has well and truly lost its hobbyist roots.When I started Asahi Linux, I let it take over most of my life. I gave up most of my hobbies (after all, this was my dream hobby), and spent significantly more than full time working on the project. It was fun back then, but it’s not fun any more. I have an M3 Pro in a box and I haven’t even turned it on yet. I dread doing the bring-up work. It doesn’t feel worth the trouble.I miss having free time where I can relax and not worry about the features we haven’t shipped yet. I miss making music. I miss attending jam sessions. I miss going out for dinner with my friends and family and not having to worry about how much we haven’t upstreamed. I miss being able to sit down and play a game or watch a movie without feeling guilty.I’m resigning as lead of the Asahi Linux project, effective immediately. The project will continue on without me, and I’m working with the rest of the team to handle transfer of responsibilities and administrative credentials. My personal Patreon will be paused, and those who supported me personally are encouraged to transfer their support to the Asahi Linux OpenCollective (GitHub Sponsors does not allow me to unilaterally pause payments, but my sponsors will be notified of this change so they can manually cancel their sponsorship).I want to thank the entire Asahi Linux team, without whom I would’ve never gotten anywhere alone. You all know who you are. I also give my utmost gratitude to all of my Patreon and GitHub sponsors, who made the project a viable reality to begin with.If you are interested in hiring me or know someone who might be, please get in touch. Remote positions only please, on a consulting or flexible time/non exclusive basis. Contact: marcan@marcan.st.: A lot of the discussion around this post and the interactions that led to it brings up the term “brigading”. Please read this excellent Fedi post for a discussion of what is and isn’t brigading.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Trump’s Military Deportation Flights Are So Expensive | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNObnSDwWnI</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GNObnSDwWnI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:34:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump’s administration started using C-17 military planes for deportations in January, signaling a hard line against migrants.

Its fantasy world isn't as expansive and seamlessly stitched together, but you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance, especially when you're engaged in its first-person combat. Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them, especially when it comes to its refined combat. These changes extend to a move away from traditional leveling in favor of a gear-focused approach, as well as the option to experiment with wild weapon combinations. But not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates.Washing up on the shores of the Living Lands, you play as one the Godlike: a select few kissed by the grace of a god at birth and left with some distinct (and sometimes frightening) facial features to show for it. On a mission from a distant monarch whose influence within the Living Lands has many of its inhabitants up in arms, your job is to track down the source of a plague that's turning the land's people into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures, before it manages to make it back home. Although it is set in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, Avowed does a good job of immediately siloing you into an area that requires little knowledge of what is happening across the ocean, but does reference some historical events from time to time. A glossary of important names and places is available as they're brought up in conversation, providing a handy guide that contextualizes some attitudes characters have to certain factions and events around you.Avowed makes a strong initial impression, quickly establishing your Godlike status but with the odd quirk of being the first not to know which god chose you. This isn't the main purpose of your mission, but that changes after a surprising event in the early hours of the game that sets the stage for a more intriguing answer to the plague ravaging the Living Lands. This setup is ultimately squandered, however, with the two big narrative hooks coalescing with one another in routinely expected and uninteresting ways, making the broader strokes of the story largely forgettable. The conversational writing does have its moments of charm, with equally serious and snarky retorts letting you inject some levity into otherwise dire situations with great comedic effect. But the severity of the plague you're trying to stop and the personal journey of finding out why you're the only Godlike without a god is not as captivating as it could be, taking steps along a narrative path that rarely deviates into surprising avenues.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wayland Color Management &amp; HDR Protocol Support Merged</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wayland-CM-HDR-Merged</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:25:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a quick follow-up to the article earlier today...

Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fostering open source culture (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/628</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/628/the-changelog-628.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arun Gupta is back, this time with his latest book in hand titled “Fostering Open Source Culture” to share his wisdom and experiences of fostering open source culture.

It’s
something that feels “obvious” to me since I’ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn’t find something that explained all of the steps – a lot of them just
said “add this to ”, but what if you’re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some
of the gotchas I’ve run into over the years.Here’s a table of contents:step 1: what shell are you using?If you’re not sure what shell you’re using, here’s a way to find out. Run this:if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out an error like “In fish, please use
$fish_pid” ( isn’t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you’re using fish, which you probably already knew)Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I’ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.step 2: find your shell’s config filein zsh, it’s probably in bash, it might be , but it’s complicated, see the note in the next sectionin fish, it’s probably ~/.config/fish/config.fish (you can run  if you want to be 100% sure)a note on bash’s config fileBash has three possible config files: , , and .If you’re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I’d recommend
testing this way:add  to your If you see “hi there”, that means  is being used! Hooray!Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with You can also try  if the first two options don’t work.(there are a lot of elaborate flow charts out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it’s not worth it and just testing is
the fastest way to be sure)step 3: figure out which directory to addLet’s say that you’re trying to install and run a program called 
and it doesn’t work, like this:$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
How do you find what directory  is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy – often the answer is something like “it depends on how npm is
configured”. A few ideas:Often when setting up a new installer (like , , , etc),
when you first set it up it’ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you’re paying attention you can get the directions then.Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell’s config file
to update your  for youSometimes just Googling “where does npm install things?” will turn up the
answerSome tools have a subcommand that tells you where they’re configured to
install things, like:
Node/npm:  (then append )Go:  (then append )asdf: asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR (then append  and )step 3.1: double check it’s the right directoryOnce you’ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it’s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine,  is
in . I can make sure that it’s the right directory by trying to
run the program  in that directory like this:$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your ,
let’s move to the next step!step 4: edit your shell configNow we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:Which directory you’re trying to add to your PATH (like  )Where your shell’s config is (like , , or ~/.config/fish/config.fish)Now what you need to add depends on your shell:Open your shell’s config file, and add a line like this:export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
(obviously replace  with the actual directory you’re trying to add)You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
In fish, the syntax is different:set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
(in fish you can also use , some notes on that further down)step 5: restart your shellNow, an extremely important step: updating your shell’s config won’t take
effect if you don’t restart it!open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don’t get confusedRun  to start a new shell (or  if you’re using zsh, or  if you’re using fish)I’ve found that both of these usually work fine.And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:problem 1: it ran the wrong programIf the wrong  of a is program running, you might need to add the
directory to the  of your PATH instead of the end.For example, on my system I have two versions of  installed, which I
can see by running :$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
The one your shell will use is the .If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
() to the  of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell’s config file (it’s  instead of the usual )export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
problem 2: the program isn’t being run from your shellAll of these directions only work if you’re running the program . If you’re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you’ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.use the full path to the program you’re running, like /home/bork/bin/my-programput the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:….). You can get the full PATH you’re
using in your shell by running .I’m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven’t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.problem 3: duplicate  entries making it harder to debugIf you edit your path and start a new shell by running  (or , or
), you’ll often end up with duplicate  entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your  every time you start your shell.Personally I don’t think I’ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what’s going on with your  if you’re trying to understand its contents.Some ways you could deal with this:If you’re debugging your , open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a “fresh” state. This should avoid the duplication.Deduplicate your  at the end of your shell’s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with )Check that the directory isn’t already in your  when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with fish_add_path --path /some/directory)How to deduplicate your  is shell-specific and there isn’t always a
built in way to do it so you’ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.problem 4: losing your history after updating your Here’s a situation that’s easy to get into in bash or zsh:Run  to reload your configPress the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)The failed command isn’t in your history! Why not?This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.Some options for fixing this:Instead of running  to reload your config, run  (or
 in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you’re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I’m
not exactly sure what the best way is)When you install  (Rust’s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don’t mention a specific
directory at all.This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. "$HOME/.cargo/env"        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
The idea is that you add that line to your shell’s config, and their script
automatically sets up your  (and potentially other things) for you.This is pretty common (for example Homebrew suggests you eval ), and there are
two ways to approach this:Just do what the tool suggests (like adding  to your shell’s config)Figure out which directories the script they’re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here’s how I’d do that:
Run  in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)Run echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo to figure out which directories it addedSee that it says  and shorten that to Add the directory  to PATH (with the directions in this post)I don’t think there’s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the “best way”!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I’m changing.fish has a handy function called  that you can run to add a directory to your  like this:fish_add_path /some/directory
This is cool (it’s such a simple command!) but I’ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:Sometimes  will update the  for every session in the
future (with a “universal variable”) and sometimes it will update the 
just for the current session and it’s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>3 thing the M4 Sherman did BETTER than the rest</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2Eye9ICYZo</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/G2Eye9ICYZo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Device Trees For Apple T2 SoCs Slated For Upstreaming In Linux 6.15</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-Apple-T2-SoC-DTs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:58:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While there has been the recent drama over upstream maintainership over Apple Silicon / Asahi Linux code, Sven Peter is continuing to move things forward for the upstream kernel and this week sent out a set of Apple SoC DeviceTree updates intended for the upcoming Linux 6.15 kernel cycle...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA Wiring Up Autonomous Performance Level Selection To Linux CPPC CPUFreq Driver</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-Auto-Perf-CPPC-CPUFreq</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:40:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Similar to the Autonomous Performance Level Selection and Energy Performance Preference (EPP) support already found within the Intel P-State and AMD P-State CPU frequency scaling drivers for their modern processors, NVIDIA engineers are working on similar support for the CPPC CPUFreq driver that can benefit their Grace processor...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wayland Color Management &amp; HDR Protocols Expected To Be Merged Imminently</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Wayland-Color-HDR-Merging-Soon</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:30:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today could finally be the day.

On Tuesday, the Google-owned Mandiant security firm said the uptick comes amid tighter purse strings and as a means for concealing nation-state-sponsored espionage by making it blend in with financially motivated cyberattacks.“Modern cybercriminals are likely to specialize in a particular area of cybercrime and partner with other entities with diverse specializations to conduct operations,” Mandiant researchers explained. “The specialization of cybercrime capabilities presents an opportunity for state-backed groups to simply show up as another customer for a group that normally sells to other criminals. Purchasing malware, credentials, or other key resources from illicit forums can be cheaper for state-backed groups than developing them in-house, while also providing some ability to blend in to financially motivated operations and attract less notice."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GenAI Patterns: Reranker</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#reranker</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LLMs struggle with large amounts of context.

She did. It got me thinking about the marshmallow experiment, where the idea was that patience equals success. But … it wasn’t the whole story.The marshmallow experiment is famous: a little kid in a room staring at a marshmallow. If they wait 15 minutes, they get two marshmallows instead of just one. Some kids would poke the marshmallow, lick it, or just gobble it up. Others found clever ways to distract themselves – singing, closing their eyes, even falling asleep. The results – children who waited supposedly went on to achieve higher scores in school and better life outcomes. The message was clear: if you can delay gratification, you’re set for life. But later studies revealed some serious holes in that conclusion.First of all, it’s not just about willpower. A follow-up study showed that kids from stable, reliable homes were much more likely to wait than kids from unpredictable ones. If you’re a kid and the adults in your life constantly break promises, why would you trust them this time? Why wait for the second marshmallow if history tells you it might not show up? Waiting isn’t a character trait; it’s a strategy. And strategies are shaped by experience.Kids are like tiny detectives, watching and learning from every single thing we do. My toddler loves routines – the same bedtime story, the same morning/evening ritual. He thrives on knowing what’s next. So when I tell her to wait and then actually deliver, I’m teaching her something important: trust. But if I say “five more minutes” and don’t follow through, I’m sending a different message – that waiting might not be worth it.Back to the marshmallow test. Another big revelation came when researchers looked at economic backgrounds. Kids from wealthier families waited longer than kids from low-income families. Not because they had more self-control, but because their environment made waiting feel safer. If you grow up knowing there will always be food on the table, waiting for an extra marshmallow isn’t a big deal. But if your life is more uncertain, grabbing what you can when you can make total sense. It’s a survival skill, not a lack of discipline.This reminds me of a moment last week. My daughter asked me to swing her in my arms, but I was busy and promised her we’d do it once I finished my work. She switched to another task and waited. When I finally asked, “Would you like to have fun now?” she cheerfully screamed, “Yes!” Would she have trusted me if I forgot about it? Probably not.Kids crave predictability. That’s why they ask for the same bedtime story 300 nights in a row. It’s why they get upset if the routine changes without warning. Predictability equals safety. And safety builds trust. When they trust us, they’re willing to wait, to try, to take risks.So, here’s where the marshmallow test gets it wrong: it’s not just about the kid’s ability to wait; it’s about the adult’s ability to create an environment worth waiting in. If we, as parents, and teachers, aren’t consistent, why would a kid believe us when we say, “Just hold on, something better is coming”?Another thing I’ve noticed is how much modeling matters. My daughter watches everything I do. If I tell her to wait and then lose my patience two seconds later because the internet is slow, what’s the lesson there? Waiting is for other people? The best way to teach patience is to live it – easier said than done …The marshmallow test also doesn’t account for cultural differences. In some cultures, waiting is baked into daily life. Think about Japan, where kids are often taught to wait quietly for meals or gifts. Compare that to the US, where instant gratification is practically a way of life. These cultural norms shape how kids approach situations like the marshmallow test. It’s not just about personality; it’s about the world they live in.In 2012, researchers added a modification to the marshmallow experiment. Before the test, kids were split into two groups. One group experienced a broken promise (they were told they’d get crayons to draw with, but never did). The other group experienced a kept promise (they actually got the crayons). Then came the marshmallow test. Which group waited longer? The kids who saw promises kept. The trust made all the difference.So what’s the takeaway here? It’s simple, really: as parents, we set the tone. Our actions, promises, and reliability shape how our kids see the world. Are we building an environment where they feel safe enough to wait? Or are we teaching them that they need to grab what they can, when they can?The marshmallow test highlights how our actions shape our kids’ lives. Small gestures – like keeping promises, sticking to “just five more minutes,” or reading bedtime stories – build trust and security. These moments might even help them wait for their own second marshmallow – or decide they don’t need to. Ultimately, it’s about the environment we are creating for them. And who knows, maybe one day they will pass their own version of the marshmallow test – not because they have to, but because they know they can.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sandbox environments: Creating efficient and isolated testing realms</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7-lQVmX-o</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fh7-lQVmX-o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

      Cherry Mui
      13 February 2025
      Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System InterfaceWebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
 port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new  port.Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm export
in the resulting Wasm binary.To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition://go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that
can be called from the host.This is analogous to the cgo  directive,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though  uses a different, simpler mechanism.A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build
flag.$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
 function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The  function must be called before any other exported functions.
The  function will not be automatically invoked.To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using Wazero, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.Supporting rich types between the host and the clientGo 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with  functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a
pointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported
field types
(see the documentation for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A  function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the  function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with  and
 functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Ted Leonsis Wants to Build a &apos;Super City&apos; of Sports Teams | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZtSKgjILKw</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eZtSKgjILKw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 23:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with Ted Leonsis, founder of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, to discuss how he came to dominate the Washington DC sports scene.

The discovery of a rare mass grave with the bones of nearly 60 people outside Luxor sends archaeologists on a quest to find out who the remains belong to, why they were buried the way they were and what was happening in ancient Egypt that would have led to a mass burial. Could the collapse of the empire’s Old Kingdom provide any clues? [Originally aired in 2019]

Following the long reign of Pepi II, a series of weak kings ruled ineffectively. Without a strong central government, local leaders asserted themselves, fracturing the country’s power base. As the climate shifted all over the world, the country was then hit by a decades-long drought that caused a great famine and economic failure.

Go behind the scenes with archaeologists and scientists as they venture through Africa – from the Pyramids to the glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro – in search of clues to solve the mystery of the mass grave, examining the political and environmental catastrophes that plunged Egypt and its people into anarchy. Were the bodies found victims of the famine, civil war or something else?

Game Bub also supports the Game Link Cable in both GB and GBA modes for multiplayer games. I designed the hardware with a number of bonus features, like video out (HDMI) via a custom dock, a rumble motor, real-time clock (for certain games). Additionally, the hardware is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future software improvements to expand its capabilities.Game Bub has a custom-designed 6 layer PCB featuring a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA with integrated memory,  display, speakers, rechargable battery, GB/GBA cartridge slot, all packaged up in a custom 3D-printed enclosure.Check out the instructions, code, and design files on GitHub. Note that building a Game Bub unit is fairly complex. If you might be interested in buying a complete Game Bub kit, please fill out this form to help me gauge interest.I had a lot of fun implementing a Game Boy at the hardware level, and I started thinking about how far I could take the project. I was using a Pynq-Z2 development board, which was definitely the right way to get started, but it came with a lot of limitations.I had to use an external monitor for audio/video, and an external gamepad for input, but a real Game Boy, of course, is a portable handheld. I also wanted to add Game Boy Advance support, but the memory architecture of the Pynq-Z2 had access latency that was just barely acceptable for the Game Boy, and would have been completely unacceptable for the Game Boy Advance. I also wanted to make something less “hacky”: a real device that I could play and give to people, not just a bare PCB.Furthermore, while there are open-source FPGA retrogaming projects (e.g. MiSTer), there doesn’t appear to be anything open-source that supports physical Game Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges, let alone an open-source handheld device.Thus, I somewhat naively set out to design what would become by far my most complex electrical engineering and hardware design project to date.I set out some goals for the project:Build a standalone, rechargable battery-powered FPGA handheldMinimize cost and complexity by using off-the-shelf components wherever possibleCapable of playing Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance gamesCapable of using physical cartridges, or emulating cartridges (reading ROM files off of a microSD card)Easy to use: graphical menu and in-game overlayIntegrated display and speakers, with headphone supportIntegrated peripherals (rumble, real-time clock, accelerometer) for emulated cartridgesHDMI video output support for playing on a big screenDecent looking design with good ergonomicsExpansion opportunities in the future: support for more systems, Wi-Fi, etc.And finally, since I was building this project for fun and learning, I wanted to be able to fully understand every single component of the system. I wanted to use my own emulator cores (e.g. not just port them from MiSTer), do my own board design, and write my own drivers to interface with peripherals.A brief rant about FPGA retrogaming#There’s a lot of misleading marketing and hype out there around FPGA retrogaming. Some claim that FPGA retrogaming devices are not emulators (because they supposedly “act like [the system] at the gate level”), that they achieve “perfect accuracy”, or that they’re superior to software emulators.In my opinion, this is blatantly wrong and actively harmful. FPGA retrogaming devices are emulators: they pretend to be something they’re not. And they’re only as accurate as they’re programmed to be, since they’re recreations. An FPGA can make certain aspects of accuracy easier to achieve, but it doesn’t guarantee it.Software emulators can be extremely accurate. Furthermore, perfect accuracy (if it’s even possible) is by no means a requirement to play an entire system’s library of games. Some people claim that FPGA emulators are the only way to “preserve” a system, but I’d argue that software emulators are a significantly more accessible (no special hardware needed!) way to further this goal.I believe that FPGA emulators have only one real advantage over software emulators: they can more easily interface with original hardware, such as physical cartridges or other consoles via link cables.I did this project not because I think that FPGA emulators are inherently better than software emulators, but because I think they’re interesting and fun to build.I began work on the project by doing some initial research and sketching out a high level design.My previous FPGA emulator project used a Xilinx Zynq chip, which integrates FPGA fabric (“PL”) with a dual-core ARM processor running Linux (“PS”). I implemented the entire emulator on the FPGA, and used the Linux system to configure the FPGA, render the UI, and load ROM files from the filesystem.I decided to keep this same division of responsibilities: using the FPGA to do the core emulation, with a separate processor to do support tasks. However, to make the overall design easier to reason about, I decided to to use an FPGA-only chip (without any hard processor cores), and an external microcontroller (MCU) to do the tasks that the ARM cores did before.The FPGA would consume input, directly interface to the game cartridges (through level shifters to support both the 3.3 volt GBA and 5 volt Game Boy), and output audio and video to the speakers and display. The MCU would handle the UI, read ROM files from the microSD card, initialize peripherals (display, DAC, IMU), handle power sequencing, and load the FPGA configuration.I wanted to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support: Wi-Fi for software updates, and the possibility of emulating the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, and Bluetooth to support wireless game controllers (when connected to an external display). To reduce complexity (and avoid the need for careful RF design), I looked only for complete Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules with integrated antennas.An early block diagram I sketched outI also drew out rough sketches of what the final device might look like: placement of buttons, screen, speakers, ports, cartridge slot, and battery. I settled on a vertical Game Boy Color-esque design (as opposed to a horizontal Game Boy Advance-style design), because I felt that this would maximize the space in the back of the device for full-size Game Boy Color cartridges and a battery.After sketching out the goals and high level design, I started component selection: picking out each non-trivial component of the system, evaluating features and requirements (e.g. how they communicate, power consumption and voltages needed).Since I intended to have this manufactured and assembled at JLCPCB, I strongly preferred parts that were available in their part library. One technique I even used for narrowing down part choices was finding the relevant category in their part search, and sorting by their stock count.I initially planned to use an RP2040 microcontroller, with a separate ESP32-WROOM module to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.The ESP32 supports both Bluetooth Classic and LE, which is essential for supporting a wide range of controllers, and the RP2040 has USB host support, to support wired controllers.During the schematic design process, I ended up simplifying the RP2040 + ESP32 combination to just a single ESP32-S3 module for a few reasons:I started running out of GPIOs on the RP2040, and I was dedicating 4 of them (2 for UART, 1 for reset, 1 for booting in firmware download mode) to communication with the ESP32. Plus, the ESP32-S3 has more GPIOs overall.I wanted to write the MCU firmware in Rust, and the ESP32-S3 had support for the Rust standard library (via ESP-IDF and esp-idf-hal). This seemed like it would be easier to get the software up and running.Fewer components means easier routing and assemblyThe ESP32-S3 has an SDIO module (for interfacing with the microSD card), and FAT filesystem support (via ESP-IDF). It would be possible to do this with the RP2040 PIO, but having a proper peripheral and driver for this makes it a lot easier.The ESP32-S3 is more powerful than the RP2040, and would probably be able to render a smoother UI.However, the ESP32-S3 has one main disadvantage compared to the original ESP32: it doesn’t have Bluetooth Classic support, only LE. This would greatly limit the range of supported wireless controllers, but I believed the compromise was worth it. I also decided to scrap USB host support, because supporting USB-C dual role (switchable device or host) would have added a lot of additional complexity.If the RP2350 microcontroller (the successor to the RP2040) had been available when I started this project, I may very well have chosen it, since it has even more power, PIO blocks, memory, and GPIO pins. I might have paired it with an RM2 radio module for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.I wanted a display that would support integer scaling for the Game Boy Advance, which has a 240x160 pixel screen. I was also looking for a screen roughly on the order of 3.0-3.5 inches wide (diagonal), to be comfortable to hold in the hand.I found the ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD module from EastRising, with a 3.5 inch display, and a 320x480 pixel resolution. This allows for a 2x integer scale for the Game Boy Advance (and a 2x scale plus centering for the 160x144 Game Boy display). This checked off almost all of the boxes: integer scaling, a good size, available at a reasonable price, pretty good documentation (for the ILI9488 LCD controller).ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD moduleThe main issue, which actually ended up being fairly annoying, is that it’s a 320x480 display, not 480x320. Meaning, it’s oriented in portrait mode, not landscape. I rotated the device 90 degrees to fit in a landscape orientation, but this created two issues:In landscape orientation, the bottom of the display (containing the LCD driver chip and the flex cable) faces to the left or the right, which means that larger bazels are required on the left and right of the display to center the “active area” of the LCD within the handheld.In landscape orientation, the display refreshes from left to right, not top to bottom.The problem with refreshing from left to right is that the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (and almost every other system) refresh from top to bottom. This means that the display can’t be refreshed perfectly in sync with the game (zero buffering), and single buffering leads to unsightly diagonal tearing. Instead, I had to use triple buffering, where the game is writing to one framebuffer, the LCD driver is reading from another buffer, and there’s one spare swap buffer. This increases the amount of memory used – and because it needed to be accessed by both the game and LCD driver simultaneously (dual port), it needed to be stored in internal block RAM in the FPGA, a scarce resource.So, even though the Game Boy emulator uses <10% of the total logic resources of the FPGA, and the Game Boy Advance uses around 30%, I had to use a large (more expensive, and power hungry) FPGA so that I had enough block RAM.I also stuck a standard size HDMI port into the design, connected directly to the FPGA. HDMI has a few additional, non-video signals that need level shifting from 5V to 3.3V (I opted for discrete transistors), and it requires the source (me!) to supply a small amount of power.I had never previously designed anything that used a lithium ion battery, so I had a fair amount of learning to do. Adafruit was a helpful resource. I needed a way to charge the battery from USB power, and a way to measure how charged it is.Lithium ion batteries can be dangerous if misused. Safely charging a battery is non-trivial, and requires a feedback loop and adjustable voltage sources. A dedicated IC seemed like the best way to do this. A lot of hobbyists use the ultra-cheap TP4056 1A battery charger, but I’d read about a lot of issues it has around safely charging the battery while using it. I decided instead to opt for the TI BQ2407x series of battery charger ICs. They seem to be widely used in commercial products, came with a comprehensive datasheet, and had a few critical features: programmable input and charge current limits, safety timers, and “power path management” for safely charging the battery while the device is on.Typical discharge curve for a 3.7V lipo battery (source: Adafruit)There are a few ways to measure the charge level of the battery, which generally relies on the fact that a lithium ion battery’s voltage depends on its charge level. A fully charged battery is about 4.2 volts, a battery with between 80% and 20% charge is about 3.7 volts, and below that a drained battery falls off pretty quickly to under 3.0 volts. If all you want is a coarse estimate of the battery level, you can use an ADC to read the voltage and estimate whether the battery is fully charged or nearly discharged. However, since the voltage curve is nearly flat between 20% and 80% charge (and is also dependent on the load), this can’t give the fine-grained battery percentage that we’re used to on phones and laptops. Instead, I opted for a discrete fuel gauge IC, the MAX17048. It’s simple to integrate and inexpensive.I decided to use a push button for the main power switch, because I needed to be able to do a graceful shutdown, where the microcontroller could save state (e.g. the current save file for an emulated cartridge) before it actually powered off.I briefly considered using an ultra-low power, always on microcontroller to act as a custom PMIC provide power switch functionality (and perhaps avoid the need for a separate real-time clock IC, and even a battery gauge). While this would have been flexible and really cool, I figured it wasn’t worth the additional complexity.The main system power ranges from about 3.4 V when the battery is discharged, to 4.2 V when the battery is fully charged, up to 5.0 V when the device is plugged in with USB.The ESP32-S3 module required 3.3 V, and most of the other ICs in the system did too. The main exception is the FPGA, which requires a 1.0 V core power rail, a 1.8 V “auxiliary” power rail, and a 3.3 V power rail for I/O. Moreover, according to the Xilinx Artix-7 datasheet (DS181), these power rails need to be powered on in a particular sequence: for my use, this means 1.0 V, then 1.8 V, then 3.3 V. Additionally, I needed a 5.0 V supply to interface with Game Boy / Game Boy Color cartridges.There are multi-rail power regulators available, and a lot of FPGA development boards use them. However, they all seemed to be expensive and difficult to purchase in low quantities. Instead, I opted for separate power regulators for each rail. I used buck converters instead of linear regulators to maximize power efficiency.I used the TLV62585 converter for the 3.3 V, 1.8 V, and 1.0 V rails. This is a simple, performant buck converter with a “power good” output, which is useful for power sequencing: you can connect the  output of one regulator to the  pin of the next regulator, to power on the rails in the desired order.For the 5.0 V rail, I used the TPS61022 boost converter. This converter is way overkill for the 5.0 V rail (which might use 75mA ), but it was readily available, and conveniently compatible with the same 1µH inductor as the buck converters.According to the FPGA datasheet, the XC7A100T consumes more than 100mW of static power. That is, it consumes that as long as it’s connected to power, even if it’s doing absolutely nothing. I figured I might want to support a low power sleep mode, so I decided to split the FPGA into a separate power domain with an explicit power enable signal from the MCU. I also used an AP2191W load switch for the FPGA’s 3.3 V rail to be able to keep the 1.0 V → 1.8 V → 3.3 V sequencing.I wanted the device to have both speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Ultimately, the FPGA generates an I2S digital audio signal, and I needed a DAC to convert it to an analog audio signal, and then an amplifier to drive the speakers (or headphones). I wanted digital volume control (to support volume buttons, rather than a volume knob or slider), and I needed some way to switch the audio output between speakers and the headphones, depending on whether or not headphones are plugged in. With no real audio experience, this seemed like a daunting task.While searching for multiple separate components, I stumbled upon the TLV320DAC3101. It combines a stereo DAC with a speaker amplifier and a headphone driver. Additionally, it supports digital volume control, and headphone detection. I think this chip is a good example of how thoughtful component selection can simplify the overall design. Looking through the datasheet, it required a 1.8 V core voltage (unlike essentially every other component other than the FPGA) and a fair amount of configuration registers to set over I2C, but it had all of the features I needed.I was originally planning to have just a single (mono) speaker, but I figured if I had a stereo DAC, I might as well put two in there. I chose the CES-20134-088PMB, an enclosed microspeaker with a JST-SH connector. Having an enclosed speaker simplified audio design, because as it turns out, you can’t just stick a speaker to a board and expect it to sound okay (Same Sky, the manufacturer of that speaker, has a blog post explaining some of the nuances).I prefer the feeling of clicky, tactile buttons (such as those found in the GBA SP, Nintendo DS (original), Nintendo 3DS, Switch) compared to “mushy” membrane buttons (such as those found in the Game Boy Color, original GBA, and Nintendo DS Lite). I learned that the tactile switches used in the GBA SP are a widely available off-the-shelf part from Alps Alpine. I used similar, but smaller buttons for the Start/Select/Home buttons, and a right-angle button from the same manufacturer for side volume and power buttons.Although I only had plans to support Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (requiring a D-pad, A and B buttons, L and R shoulder buttons, and Start/Select), I opted to add two more “X” and “Y” face buttons to leave the possibility open of supporting more systems in the future.The L and R buttons posed an additional challenge – I found numerous right-angle tactile buttons (to be soldered onto the back, facing towards the top). However, none of them seemed to have the actuator (the part of the button you make contact with) far enough away from the PCB to be easily pressed. At first, I thought about making a separate shoulder button board to move them at the correct distance, but then I started looking at what existing devices do for inspiration. The Game Boy Advance SP actually uses a more complex mechanism for the shoulder buttons: rather than a simple actuator like the face buttons, there’s a hinge with a torsion spring that hits the actuator at an angle. This is actually part of what makes the shoulder buttons pleasant to press: you don’t need to hit them from exactly the right direction, because they pivot. I ended up just going with a standard right-angle tactile button, opting to solve the problem with the mechanism in the enclosure.GBA SP shoulder button mechanismOne of my main goals was to allow ROM files to be loaded from a microSD card, rather than only being able to be played from a physical cartridge. To do this, I’d need dedicated RAM for the FPGA to hold the game. Game Boy Advance games, typically, are a maximum of 32 MB. They don’t make SRAMs that large (and if they did, they’d be very expensive). Instead, I needed to use DRAM.Asynchronous SRAM is very simple: supply a read address to the address pins, and some amount of nanoseconds later, the data you’re reading appears on the data pins. DRAM is more complex: the simplest kind is “single data rate synchronous DRAM” (SDR SDRAM, or just SDRAM, distinguishing it from the significantly more complex DDR SDRAM). However, even SDRAM is non-trivial to use. DRAM is organized into banks, rows, and columns, and accessing DRAM requires sending commands to “activate” (open) a rows before reading out “columns”, and then “precharging” (closing) a row. Handling all of this requires a DRAM controller (see this simple description of the state machine required). This isn’t terribly complex, but I was signing myself up for more work.Alternatively, I could have chosen a PSRAM chip (essentially DRAM with an integrated controller to make it have a more SRAM-like interface). However, I couldn’t find a PSRAM part that I was happy with (cost, availability, interface), and so I ended up going with the inexpensive W9825G6KH 32MB 16-bit SDRAM.I also decided to stick a 512 KiB SRAM chip in the design in case I ended up needing some more simple memory later, like for emulating the SRAM used for Game Boy cartridge save files. Despite being 1/64 the capacity, this chip was about 3x the cost of the SDRAM. This ended up being a wise decision, since a lot of my internal FPGA block ram was eaten up by the triple buffer for the display (see above).Cartridge and Link Ports#The cartridge slot and link ports are no-name parts from Aliexpress, easily available for cheap. These seem to mostly be GBA SP compatible, and are often used as repair parts.The Game Boy Advance can play both Game Boy [Color] and Game Boy Advance games. These run at different voltages and use different protocols, so the device need some way of determining which type of cartridge is inserted.GBA cartridge (top) vs GB cartridge (bottom)The cartridges are physically different at the bottom: GBA cartridges (the top cartridge in the image) have a notch on either side. The GBA has a  that senses the absence of a notch on an inserted cartridge and switches the device into Game Boy Color mode.I measured the size and position of this notch, and searched Digi-Key and Mouser for switches that met these constraints. In the end, I was only able to find a single switch that would work.Miscellaneous peripherals#I used the surprisingly cheap LSM6DS3TR-C IMU from ST. This tiny IMU has a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, more than sufficient for emulating the few GB/GBA cartridges that have motion controls.For keeping track of time even when the device was off, I used the PCF8563T real-time clock chip. I chose this because it was 1) I2C (no additional pins required) 2) cheap and 3) readily available from JLCPCB. Interestingly, all of the real-time clock chips I found count in seconds/minutes/hours/days/months/years. This makes sense for a really simple device with minimal computational power. However, it’s annoying for my purposes, since all I really want is a timestamp I can pass to some other datetime library, and converting between the calendar time and a unix timestamp is non-trivial due to how the chips incompletely handle leap years.I picked up a few cheap coin vibration motors to use for vibration support (for the rare cartridge that had a built-in vibration motor).I also used a TCA9535 I2C I/O expander to connect the face buttons to the MCU. I ran out of pins, and while I  have used the FPGA as a sort of I/O expander, I figured I’d make it simpler for myself (and allow the buttons to be used even if the FPGA was powered off) by letting the MCU read them itself.For this project, as with my previous ones, I used KiCad to create my schematic and do PCB layout. I really can’t recommend KiCad enough: it’s a great program, intuitive to use, and it’s free and open source.This was a very ambitious project for my level of electrical engineering experience, and creating the schematic took a couple of weeks. I spent a lot of time designing the circuit for each component, because I was afraid I’d do something wrong and end up with a stack of useless boards without the skills needed to debug them. A lot of the component selection actually happened in parallel with schematic design, as I found new requirements or problems and had to change components.I gained a lot of experience reading component datasheets. It’s a really valuable skill, both for component selection and for creating designs that use the components. Nearly every datasheet has a “typical application” section, where the manufacturer shows how the component would fit into a circuit. At minimum, this has power supply information (e.g. these voltages to these pins with these decoupling capacitors). For more complex components like the DAC, it also has information about power sequencing, different ways the device could be connected to the rest of the system, a register list, that sort of thing. Some components also included PCB layout recommendations. This information was all really helpful, and gave me a good deal of confidence that my board would work as long as I read through the datasheet and followed the manufacturer’s recommendations.Then I got to the FPGA. Nearly every component has a single datasheet. Some of them have an additional application note or two. Particularly complex chips (like the ESP32-S3 microcontroller) have a separate datasheet, reference manual, and hardware design guide. The Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs have . Overviews, packaging and pinout, configuration guides, BGA design rules, power specifications, clocking resources, I/O specifications, PCB layout guides, design checklists… even a 4MB Excel spreadsheet for estimating power consumption! And believe me, Xilinx didn’t just write documentation for fun: there’s so much documentation because the chip  this much documentation.Designing with the FPGA was overwhelming, and  beyond my experience level. At several points I genuinely considered dropping the project altogether. Fortunately, I persevered, and gradually internalized a lot of the information. I also read through the schematics of any open-source Artix-7 development board I could get my hands on. Seeing what other people were doing gave me more confidence that I was doing the right thing.Eventually, I laid out all of the components, connected them, ensured all of the nets were labeled, and ran KiCad’s electrical rules checker (ERC) to find obvious mistakes, I moved on to layout.I did PCB layout at the same time as some of the initial enclosure CAD. The mechanics of how everything fit together influenced the placement of the display connector, cartridge slot, buttons, speakers, and connectors. After I came up with a plausible enclosure design, I placed some of the first key components onto the PCB and locked them into place while I did the rest of the routing.Rough enclosure design to help with board layoutI first focused on components that would be hardest to route. Primarily, the FPGA: the package I was using (CSG324) is a BGA, 18x18 with 0.8mm pitch between pins. “Fanning out” all of the I/O signals requires careful routing, and at 0.8mm pitch, it’s difficult to do this routing with cheap PCB manufacturing techniques. I ended up being able to do this routing with a 6-layer PCB (three signal, two ground, one power), with 0.1mm track width and spacing, and 0.4/0.25 mm vias. Fortunately, this is all within the realm of JLCPCB’s capabilities.BGA fanout with thin traces and small viasAs I routed signals out from the FPGA to other parts, I assigned those signals to the FPGA pins. Similarly, with the MCU, I assigned signals to pins in a way that made routing easier. Certain signals had restrictions (e.g. on the FPGA, the main 50 MHz clock signal can only go into certain pins, or the configuration bitstream can only go to certain pins, or certain pins are differential pairs for HDMI output), but overall, I had a lot of flexibility with pin assignment.KiCad has a feature where it automatically backs up your project as you work on it. I changed the settings to save every 5 minutes and not delete old backups, which allowed me to generate this timelapse of my layout process:Revision 1 board layout timelapseOnce I finished placing and routing all of the components, I ran the design rules checker (DRC) and fixed issues. I hesitated for a while before sending the PCB for manufacturing. I re-read the schematics, reviewed the layout, and eventually felt confident enough that I was done. I submitted the order to JLCPCB, and after a few questions by their engineers about component placement, they started manufacturing it.Board testing and bring-up#After two weeks or so, I received the assembled boards in the mail:An assembled board and an unassembled boardFirst, I probed the power rail test points with a multimeter to check for shorts. Then, I plugged the boards in for the first time, and pressed the power button. To my delight, the green LED turned on, indicating that the power button circuit, power path, and 3.3V regulator worked. The microcontroller USB enumerated, and I could see that it logged some errors (since I hadn’t flashed anything to it yet).I intended to write the MCU firmware in Rust, but I did initial board testing and bring-up with MicroPython. This would let me interactively type in Python and write basic scripts to communicate with the peripherals on the board and make sure I had connected everything correctly. I didn’t have to worry about writing efficient or well-organized code, and could just focus on functionality.I flashed the MicroPython firmware image, and wrote a couple lines of Python to blink the LED. I powered on the FPGA power domain, and checked that the , , and  rails had the correct voltage.Next, I wrote a simple bitstream for the FPGA that read the state of the buttons and produced a pattern on the shared signals between the FPGA and the MCU. I wrote simple Python code to configure the FPGA, loaded up the bitstream, and polled the signals from the FPGA. Pressing buttons changed the state, and confirmed that the FPGA was properly powered, and configurable from the MCU.After I confirmed the FPGA worked, I started writing a simple display driver to initialize the LCD and push some pixels from the MCU over SPI. The initialization sequence uses a number of LCD-specific parameters (voltages, gamma correction, etc.), that I learned from the LCD manufacturer’s example code.(Slowly) pushing pixels to the LCDThe LCD module’s controller, an ILI9488, has a few quirks: despite claiming that it supports 16-bit colors over SPI, it actually only supports 18-bit colors. This unfortunately meant that the MCU’s LCD driver would be more inefficient than I expected, since it has to expand 16-bit colors to 18-bit before sending them over the bus. This didn’t end up being a huge issue, however, because the FPGA is the one driving the display most of the time.Another quirk (hardware bug?) is that the ILI9488 doesn’t stop driving its SPI output line, even when its chip-select signal is inactive. This means that the chip will interfere with any other communication on the bus… including the FPGA, which sits on the same bus. I never actually needed to read any data back from the LCD (and even if I did, it supports three-wire SPI), so I just cut the trace between the LCD’s SDO line and the SPI bus.Debugging the LCD test codeTrouble with power domains#I started trying to communicate with the I2C peripherals (I/O expander, RTC, etc.), and found that nothing was responding. A bit of probing with a logic analyzer revealed that the SCL/SDA lines were being held low, and that powering on the FPGA power domain let the lines be pulled high and communication to happen.I deduced that this was due to the DAC, which had its IOVDD powered by , which likely caused its protection diodes to pull the IO lines (SCL and SDA) low:The problematic portion of the schematicI tested out this theory by cutting the PCB traces connecting the DAC’s IOVDD and  with a knife. After this, I2C worked even with the FPGA power disabled. Then, I tested a possible fix by adding a wire to power the DAC’s IOVDD from the  rail. I confirmed that I could still talk to the other I2C devices, and once enabling FPGA power, that I could talk to the DAC too.While bringing up the LCD, I saw that the FPGA was also pulling down the shared SPI bus lines while it was unpowered. Not enough to prevent communication with the LCD, but it still wasn’t great. Between this and the DAC issue, I learned an important EE lesson: be careful when connecting components in different power domains together. A tristate buffer, such as the 74LVC1G125, could have helped here to isolate the buses.Once I2C was working, I wrote some basic driver code for the fuel gauge, real-time clock, IMU, and I/O expander, just to check that they all worked correctly. I also checked that the MCU could read from and write to the attached microSD card.Audio and video output from the FPGA#Next, I updated my testing FPGA bitstream with a to output a test pattern over the LCD parallel interface (“DPI”), and a test tone to the DAC over the I2S interface. Then, I began poking on the MCU side to configure the LCD controller and DAC appropriately.With some amount of trial and error, I convinced the LCD to accept input from the FPGA. Most of the trial and error revolved around the rotation of the LCD module. Soon after, I configured the DAC properly, and it played the test tone from the FPGA over the speakers and the headphones.WIP video output from the FPGAAt this point, much of the board was working, so I soldered on the rest of the components (cartridge slot, cartridge switch, link port, shoulder buttons).With the cartridge slot in place, I had everything I needed to port over the Game Boy emulator from my last project. I did a quick-and-dirty port of the emulator, with some hacking around to connect the core to the audio, video, and the physical cartridge. I was able to play the first Game Boy game on the device far sooner than I was expecting:Pokemon Silver running from cartridgeI spent the next month or so implementing things on the FPGA. I started on the SPI receiver implementation, so that the MCU and FPGA could communicate.It was relatively straightforward to write the initial version, which 4x oversampled the SPI signals from the main system clock. For the Game Boy, that was ~8 MHz, for a maximum SPI speed of 2 MHz. The MicroPython ESP32-S3 SPI implementation supported only single SPI, so that allowed for a maximum transfer speed of 256 KB/s. This was sufficient to do most of my initial testing, but I later wrote an improved SPI receiver to run with an internal 200 MHz clock (from a PLL that turned on and off with the chip-select signal to save power), communicating with the rest of the system via a pair of FIFOs. This added a lot of complexity and edge cases, but it greatly improved performance, allowing the bus to run at 40 MHz.I wrote the SPI interface to the FPGA with memory-like semantics: each SPI transfer starts with a command byte, encoding whether it’s a read or write transfer, the size of each word in the transfer (8, 16, or 32 bits), and whether the “target address” should autoincrement as the transfer progresses. Then, a 32-bit address, followed by reading or writing the data. Each thing that the MCU might want to access (control registers, blocks of memory) are mapped into the 32-bit address space.As with my previous FPGA project, I wrote almost all of the FPGA code in Chisel, a Scala-based HDL. The remaining bits were the top-level Verilog. Chisel made it really simple to parametrize, compose, and test the various modules that I wrote.Once I had the SPI receiver working, I wrote controllers for the on-board SRAM and SDRAM. The SRAM was relatively simple (although I still got it slightly wrong at first). The SDRAM was a bit tricky, and even as I write this I’m not quite satisfied with its performance, and intend to rewrite it in the future.I exposed the SRAM and SDRAM interfaces to the MCU via SPI, which allowed me to read and write to these pieces of memory from the MCU. I used this a lot for testing: writing patterns into memory and reading them back to ensure that read and write both worked.Side note: SDRAM has to be continuously refreshed, otherwise the stored data decays over time. It depends on the chip, but typically each row has to be read and written back (or auto-refreshed, which does the same thing) at least once every 64 milliseconds to avoid losing state. What I found interesting, however, is that the data can actually persist for quite a bit longer. I discovered that when I was reconfiguring the FPGA between tests, most of the test data that I had previously written would still stick around even without being refreshed. In the first few seconds some bits would start flipping, and over the course of a few minutes, most of what was written was completely unintelligible.With the SDRAM controller and SPI receiver written, I was then able to implement the “emulated cartridge” part of the Game Boy emulator, where the MCU reads a ROM file off of the microSD card and sends it to the FPGA to be stored in SDRAM. Then, the FPGA “emulates” a cartridge (rather than interfacing with a real physical cartridge). After a few stupid mistakes, I was able to run test ROMs and homebrew. As an added bonus, since I was using my own SDRAM controller directly, I didn’t have any of the performance issues I’d faced before when accessing the ROM stored in memory.Writing the microcontroller firmware in Rust#By this point I had tested, in some form or another, all of the different components of the system. I’m really surprised that everything worked in my first board revision – even the rework I did early on wasn’t actually required for functionality.I decided now was a good time to start building an interactive GUI. Up until this point, I had just been running commands in the MicroPython REPL. However, I didn’t want to build a whole UI in Python just to throw it away later, so I also started working on the “production” Rust firmware.In the last few years, a lot of progress has been made towards making Rust on the ESP32 chips work well, even on the chips that use the Xtensa ISA. I followed the Rust on ESP Book and quickly had an environment set up. I opted for the “Rust with the Standard Library” approach, so that I could benefit from ESP-IDF, especially the built-in support for USB and SD cards with the FAT filesystem.I started porting over the drivers I had written in Python. I found embedded Rust to be a bit verbose in some cases, but overall pleasant to use and worth the (little) trouble.I starting writing my own minimal GUI framework for basic menus. I poked around with the  library, but soon found that the typical patterns I was expecting to use weren’t a great fit for Rust. I also started planning out different screens and realized that I probably actually wanted to use a more comprehensive UI framework.Ultimately, I settled on Slint, a Rust-native declarative GUI framework with excellent support for embedded devices. Slint has a custom DSL to describe the UI and composable components. After a bit of practice I found myself to be really productive with it. I enjoyed using Slint, and I’d use it again in the future. The authors are responsive on GitHub, and the project has steadily improved over the year or so that I’ve been using it.There were a few rough edges for my use case, however:The built-in GUI elements and examples were all heavily oriented around mouse or touchscreen navigation. Game Bub only has buttons for navigation, however, so I had to make my own widgets (buttons, lists) that worked with key navigation. This involved a few hacks, because Slint’s focus handling was a little bit simplistic.The built-in GUI styles looked (in my opinion) bad on a low DPI screen. Text was excessively anti-aliased and hard to read at small sizes. This was also fixed by building my own widgets.Slint doesn’t have a great story around supporting different “screens” – I had to build some of my own infrastructure to be able to support navigation between the main menu, games, rom select, settings, etc.The GUI is rendered on the MCU, and then the rendered framebuffer is sent over to the FPGA. Slint supports partial rendering, where only the parts of the screen that have changed are updated, which improved performance. The FPGA maintains a copy of the framebuffer and ultimately is responsible for driving the display. This has a few advantages over driving the display directly from the MCU:Sending a framebuffer at 40 MHz QSPI to the FPGA is 16x faster than sending it to the LCD controller at 10 MHz (the fastest speed supported by the ILI9488)The UI is rendered at 240x160 to improve performance and maintain the GBA aesthetic, but the LCD controller doesn’t have a scaler, so the MCU would have to send 4x the pixels. The FPGA can easily scale the UI framebuffer itself.The FPGA can composite the emulator output with a semi-transparent “overlay” to support an in-game menu, volume / brightness bars, battery notifications, etc.An external display (e.g. monitor or TV) can be driven by the FPGA via HDMII spent some time making a variety of firmware improvements, mostly polish and quality-of-life. I added a settings screen to set the date and time, whether to use Game Boy (DMG) or Game Boy Color (CGB) mode when playing Game Boy games, etc.Then I improved the ROM select file browser, and added a battery level indicator.I also got sick of having to take the microSD card out of the device and connect it to my computer through a series of adapters (microSD to SD to USB-A to USB-C), so I implemented a basic utility to expose the microSD card as a USB Mass Storage Device, using TinyUSB and the ESP32-S3’s USB-OTG capabilities.It was a little bit more difficult than I expected, because USB Mass Storage requires the device to provide raw block access. This means that the filesystem has to be unmounted by the device, otherwise the device and host could conflict and corrupt the filesystem. The ESP32-S3 also only supports USB Full Speed, for a practical maximum transfer speed of ~600KB/sec. It’s really useful for transferring save files or updating the FPGA bitstreams, but less useful for transferring a large number of ROM files.Later, I implemented MBC7 support in the Game Boy emulator for Kirby Tilt ’n Tumble, using the on-board accelerometer.After I implemented a decent amount of software functionality, I decided to finish the enclosure design. The bare board just wasn’t cutting it anymore, and the taped LCD module, loose speakers, and rubber-banded battery was fragile.Game Bub looking rough without an enclosureI came into this project without any CAD or 3D printing experience. I looked at a few different CAD software packages, and I ultimately settled on FreeCAD, primarily because it was free and open source. I learned how to use the software with some video tutorials. FreeCAD, unfortunately, was a little bit rough around the edges and I ended up running into some annoying issues. Nevertheless, I powered through and finished the design.FreeCAD view of the enclosure and some buttonsI found parametric modeling, where the geometry of the model is defined by constraints and dimensions, to be intuitive. However overall, I found 3D CAD to be very time consuming. I think a large part of this is my inexperience, but thinking in three dimensions is a lot more difficult than, say, a 2D PCB layout. Creating a full assembly was even more difficult: I had to visualize how the front and rear pieces would fit together, where the screws would go, and how the buttons, screen, speaker, cartridge slot, battery, and ports would all fit in. This project definitely pushed the boundaries of my (previously non-existent) product design skills.After finishing the design, I printed out the technical drawing at a 1:1 scale and physically placed the board and other components down as a final check. Then, I sent it to JLCPCB for manufacturing. I opted for SLA resin printing, for high precision and a smooth finish.Enclosure technical drawingAfter a couple weeks, I got the finished enclosure and custom buttons back.Front and rear half, outsideI put the buttons, speakers, and screen into the enclosure, screwed on the PCB, and put the whole thing together.Assembling the front sideGame Bub, fully assembled and functionalI wasn’t sure how dimensionally accurate the 3D printing would be, so I added a lot of extra clearance around the buttons and ports. As it turned out, the printing was very precise, so the buttons rattled around a little in the oversized button holes.It’s a little bit chunky (smaller than an original Game Boy, though!) and the ergonomics aren’t ideal, but I was really happy to finally have an enclosure. It actually started (sort of) looking like a real product, and I wasn’t constantly worried about breaking it anymore.Game Boy Advance support#I won’t go into all of the details of how I wrote the emulator here (this article is already long enough!). If you’re interested, my previous article about my Game Boy FPGA emulator goes into detail about the general process of writing an emulator, and for a high-level introduction to the Game Boy Advance (from a technical perspective), I recommend Rodrigo Copetti’s article. In general, I tried to implement the emulator the way it might actually have been implemented in the original hardware: each cycle of the FPGA corresponds to one actual hardware cycle (no cheating!).As with the Game Boy, I did nearly all of my development with a simulator backed by Verilator and SDL. By the end of the development process, the simulator was running at about 8% of the real-time speed (on an M3 MacBook Air with excellent single-core performance), which was a bit painful.The Game Boy Advance CPU, the ARM7TDMI, is significantly more complicated than the Game Boy’s SM83 (a Z80 / 8080-ish hybrid). However, in some ways, it was easier to understand and implement: the ARM7TDMI is much closer to a simple modern processor architecture, and it’s extensively documented by ARM. For example, the ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual has block diagrams and detailed cycle-by-cycle instruction timing descriptions.I had a lot of fun implementing the CPU. The architecture has a three-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute) – a division that feels natural when you implement it in hardware. The ARM7TDMI has two instruction sets: the standard 32-bit ARM instruction set, and the compressed 16-bit THUMB instruction set. I implemented the CPU the way it works in hardware, where the only difference between ARM and THUMB is the decode stage.As I was implementing the CPU, I wrote test cases for each instruction. Each test checks the functionality of the instruction: processor state, register values after, as well as the cycle-by-cycle behavior and interaction with the memory bus. This was helpful for catching regressions as I implemented more and more control logic. It was also really satisfying to be able to implement individual instructions, then write the tests, and check that everything worked.Chisel made it easy to write out the CPU control logic. The CPU control logic is a state machine that generates microarchitectural control signals (e.g. bus A should hold the value from the first read register, bus B should hold an immediate value, the memory unit should start fetching the computed address, etc.). Chisel allowed me to collect common functionality into functions (e.g.  to set up the signals to dispatch the next decoded instruction, or  to signal that the pipeline should be flushed and a new instruction should be fetched from the current program counter).I found it helpful to draw out timing diagrams with WaveDrom when working through instructions, especially to deal with the pipelined memory bus.My timing diagram of the ARM7TDMI branch instructionsBy mid-May (about a month later), I finished the CPU implementation (with occasional bug fixes after) and moved onto the rest of the system.PPU, MMIO, and everything else#Over the next month and a half, I implemented the majority of the rest of the Game Boy Advance. The CPU interacts with the rest of the system via memory-mapped IO (MMIO) registers. Unlike the Game Boy CPU, which can only access memory a single byte at a time, the ARM7TDMI can make 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit accesses. This complicates MMIO, and the different hardware registers and memory regions in the GBA respond to different access widths in different ways.I started with the Picture Processing Unit (PPU), which produces the video output. The author of NanoBoyAdvance, fleroviux, had helpfully documented the PPU VRAM access patterns, which gave a lot of insight into how the PPU might work internally. Tonc was also immensely helpful for implementing the PPU and testing individual pieces of functionality.(Sort of) running a Tonc PPU demoThe PPU took a few weeks, and then I moved onto DMA, followed by hardware timers, and audio. Of course, as I’d try new tests, demos, and games, I’d uncover bugs and fix them.Kirby  in Dream LandGame Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges use the same 32-pin connector. However, they work very differently. The Game Boy cartridge bus is asynchronous: the game outputs the 16-bit address (64 KiB address space) on one set of pins and lowers the  pin, some time later, the 8-bit read data from the ROM stabilizes on a separate set of pins.For the GBA, Nintendo extended the bus data width to 16-bit and the address space to 25-bit (32 MiB). However, they kept roughly the same set of pins, accomplishing this by multiplexing the 24 data/address pins: the console outputs the address (in increments of the data word size of 16-bits, for a 24-bit physical address), then lowers the  signal to “latch” the address in the cartridge. Then, each time the console pulses the  pin, the cartridge increments its latched address and outputs the next data over the same pins. This allows for a continuous read of sequential data without having to send a new address for each access. The GBA also allows games to configure cartridge access timings to support different ROM chips.I had to do a lot of my own research here. Software emulators don’t need to care about the precise timing of the cartridge bus, so there wasn’t much documentation. To figure out the exact cycle-accurate timing, I used a Saleae logic analyzer and connected it to the cartridge bus. I wrote a test program for the GBA to do different types of accesses (reads, writes, sequential, non-sequential, DMA) with different timing configurations.Cartridge bus analysis setupAfter coming up with numerous scenarios (especially around the interaction between DMA and the CPU, and starting and stopping burst accesses), I came up with a consistent model for how cartridge accesses worked. I created some timing diagrams to help:Timing diagram of a non-sequential access followed by a sequential accessFinally, I started implementing the cartridge controller state machine based on my observations, paired with an emulated cartridge implementation. With the emulated cartridge, I was able to properly run real games in the simulator.I quickly implemented physical cartridge support, to be able to finally run it on the actual FPGA. I connected the signals, built a new bitstream, and… it didn’t work at all. The Game Boy Advance boot screen ran, but it didn’t get any further than that. I implemented the emulated cartridge on the FPGA (reading ROM files from the SD card), and it worked! Which was great, but physical cartridges still didn’t.I used the logic analyzer to observe how my emulator was interacting with the cartridge compared to how an actual GBA, and found numerous issues.One of the first things I noticed was short glitches on the  line. I knew these had to be glitches (rather than incorrect logic), because they were 8 nanoseconds long, much shorter than the ~59.6ns clock period. Since the cartridge latches the address on a falling edge of , glitches cause it to latch an address when it shouldn’t, screwing up reads.Glitches on the cartridge busHere, I learned an important lesson in digital design: output signals should come directly from flip-flops, with no logic in between.After each flip-flop outputs a new value (on the rising edge of the clock), the signals propagate through the chip. As they propagate, taking different paths of different lengths throughout the chip, the output from each lookup table (LUT) is unstable. These values only stabilize near the end of the clock cycle (assuming the design met timing closure), and then each flip-flop stores the stable value at the next rising edge. If you output a signal from logic, this instability is visible from outside of the chip, manifesting as glitches in the output signal. If you instead output the signal from a flip-flop, it’ll change only on each clock edge, remaining stable in the middle.And of course, I had written the cartridge controller without thinking about this, and  of the output signals were generated from logic. I rewrote the controller to output everything from flip-flops, which had a series of cascading changes since all of the signals now had to be computed one clock cycle earlier than I expected.There were other issues too – part of the problem was that my emulated cartridge model was too permissive, and didn’t catch some fairly obvious incorrect behavior. After a few days of intensive debugging with the logic analyzer, I got to the point where I could play games from physical cartridges.Metroid: Zero Mission running from the cartridgeCartridge prefetch buffer#The ARM7TDMI has a single shared instruction and data memory bus. As a result, a long series of sequential memory accesses is rare. Even a linear piece of code without branches that includes “load” or “store” instructions would produce a series of non-sequential memory accesses, as the CPU fetches an instruction from one location, loads a register from a different location, and then goes back to fetching the next instruction.This poses a real performance issue on the GBA, because every non-sequential access from the cartridge incurs a multi-cycle penalty. Nintendo attempted to mitigate this somewhat with the “prefetch buffer” (read this post by endrift, the author of mGBA, for more details) which attempts to keep a cartridge read burst active between CPU accesses. Without emulating the prefetch buffer, some games lag (I noticed this the most in Mario Kart Super Circuit, and some rooms of Metroid: Zero Mission).The prefetch buffer, while simple in theory, is not well documented and has a lot of corner cases and weird interactions. Emulator developers often start by taking a shortcut: making all cartridge accesses take a single cycle when the prefetch buffer is enabled. This wouldn’t work for me, since I actually had to interface with the physical cartridge.So, I set out to do some more research to figure out exactly how the prefetch buffer worked. After making some educated guesses and tests, I came up with a reasonable model of how it might work.Notes about the prefetch state machineActually implementing it took a lot of work, and I kept stumbling upon more and more corner cases. Eventually I got to the point where all games appeared to run at full speed, and most importantly, didn’t randomly crash. My implementation isn’t perfect: there are still a few mGBA test suite timing tests I don’t pass, but it’s certainly sufficient to play games.: standard duplex SPI, used for communicating with accessories: custom multi-drop UART-like protocol, used to link up to four GBAs together for multiplayer games: the Nintendo N64 and GameCube controller protocol, used to connect to a GameCube: duplex UART with flow control, : controlling the four pins individually as GPIO, The timing of these isn’t well documented, so I did my own research.A  mode transfer with no attached consolesI did a lot of testing with examples from the gba-link-connection library, intended for homebrew GBA games, but helpful for testing the different transfer modes in a controlled environment.Multiplayer Mario Kart with Game Bub and a GBAGame Bub linked to a GameCube playing Animal CrossingDuring the emulator development, I had used various test ROMS (mentioned before) to test basic functionality in isolation. As my emulator became mature enough to run commercial games, however, I started to shift some of my focus to accuracy-focused test ROMs.These test ROMs (such as the mGBA test suite) generally test really specific hardware quirks and timing. For example, they might test what happens when you run an instruction that ARM calls “unpredictable”, or the exact number of cycles it takes to service an interrupt in specific scenarios, or the value of the “carry” flag after performing a multiplication. These are the kinds of things that don’t actually matter for playing games, but present a fun challenge and a way to “score” your emulator against others. This also highlights the collaborative nature of the emulation development community: people sharing their research and helping each other out.I won’t talk about all of the tests here (for my emulator’s test results, see this page). But I do want to mention the . This is an official test cartridge from Nintendo, likely used as part of a factory test or RMA procedure. Apparently, Nintendo has  used it to test their emulators (e.g. their GBA emulator on the Nintendo Switch). This test has generally been considered to be difficult to pass (it tests some specific hardware quirks), but it’s easier now that the tests have been thoroughly reverse engineered and documented. Still, passing it is a nice milestone:Passing the AGB Aging CartridgeSecond hardware revision#Towards the end of 2024, approximately one year after I originally designed Game Bub, I decided to make a second hardware revision. Over the past year, I had been keeping track of all of the things I would want to change in a future revision. Since the first version of Game Bub miraculously worked without any major issues, this list was primarily minor issues and ergonomics changes.I fixed the minor I2C power issues, removed the reference designators from the PCB silkscreen (they looked messy with the dense board, and I didn’t use them for anything anyway), and changed around some test points. I improved the rumble circuit to be more reponsive, and switched to a PCB-mounted vibration motor.The first version of Game Bub was fairly thick, measuring 12.9mm at the top and 21.9mm on the bottom. The thickness of the rear enclosure was dictated by the thickness of Game Boy cartridges, but I made several changes to the front. I moved the  (8.5mm!) link port to the back, and removed the HDMI port (more on that later). I changed the headphone jack (5.0mm tall – no wonder they started getting removed from phones) to a mid-mount one that sunk into the PCB and reduced the overall height.I also switched from an  module (3.1mm depth) to an  (2.4mm depth). I should have done this from the beginning, I just didn’t even know the ESP32-S3-MINI existed. This had the side effect of giving me 3 more GPIOs, which allowed me to put the FPGA and LCD on separate SPI busses, avoiding the minor issue of an unpowered FPGA interfering with LCD communication, and allowed for faster boot because the LCD could be configured at the same time as the FPGA.I switched the speakers, from the fully-enclosed CES-20134-088PMB to the CMS-160903-18S-X8. I made this change primarily for ease of assembly. The first speaker had a wire connector that plugged into the board, and I found it difficult to connect during assembly without having the wire interfere with buttons. The new speaker is smaller and has a spring contact connector, so it just presses against the PCB as the device is assembled. This required some speaker enclosure design – an unenclosed speaker in free air sounds quiet and tinny.I reworked the layout of the face buttons and D-pad to match the spacing of the Nintendo DSi. This allowed me to use the silicone membranes from the DSi for an improved button feel and reduced rattling. I was also hoping to use the plastic buttons from the DSi (which were higher quality compared to my 3D printed buttons), but even with the new thinner design, the buttons weren’t quite tall enough to be easily pressed.I created another timelapse of my modifications to produce the second version of the PCB:Revision 2 board layout timelapseFor the second revision of the enclosure, I switched to Fusion 360 for the CAD work. While I would have preferred to keep using FreeCAD, I found that it was making it harder for me to be productive. Fusion 360 has a free version for hobbyists (with some limitations that have gradually increased over time), and overall I’ve found it very pleasant to use.Fusion 360 view of the second enclosure, fully assembledUnlike with the first revision, I waited until I had a final design for both the enclosure and the PCB before getting anything manufactured. This let me go back and forth, making small modifications to each of them as needed.I wanted to make the end result look more polished and professional, so I contracted a factory to produce custom LCD cover glass, made out of 0.7mm thick tempered glass with a black silkscreen. It was relatively expensive for a low quantity order, but I’m really happy with how it turned out.Custom LCD cover glass with adhesive backingManufacturing and assembly#I got the PCBs manufactured and assembled, this time with black solder mask to look .Assembled PCB, revision 2I had two enclosures made. The first was black PA-12 Nylon, printed with MJF. Nylon is strong and durable, and the MJF 3D printing technology produces a slightly grainy surface that’s really pleasant to hold in your hand.Closeup of the nylon grainy textureThe second one was made of transparent resin (SLA, like before). This lets me show off the PCB that I worked so hard on, and evokes the transparent electronics trend from the 90s.Assembly was a lot easier this time around: the silicone membranes held the face buttons in place, the speakers had a spring contact instead of wires, and the shoulder button assembly was better. In the first revision, I had excessively large tolerances because I wasn’t sure how precise the 3D printing would be. In the second version, I was able to shrink these.The final product looked and felt a lot better, too. The edges were more rounded, and the device was thinner and easier to hold. The buttons felt  better to press and didn’t rattle around, and the cover glass over the LCD added polish.First revision (left), second revision (center and right)I previously mentioned that I removed the full-size HDMI port from the first revision. I had first planned to change it to a mini-HDMI or micro-HDMI port to reduce the size, but I was worried about durability.What I  wanted to do was output video through the USB-C port, avoiding the need for any HDMI port at all. Unfortunately, I had already concluded earlier that I wouldn’t be able to output DisplayPort video signals from the FPGA, which meant that I couldn’t use the standard USB-C DisplayPort alternate mode.However, an idea struck me towards the end of 2024: I didn’t actually  to use the DisplayPort alt-mode. The USB-C connector, in addition to the USB 2.0 D+/D- pins, has four differential pairs (for USB superspeed). Conveniently, HDMI  uses four differential pairs. The USB specification allows for vendor-specific alt-modes, so I could just implement my own, outputting the HDMI signal directly from the FPGA over the additional pins. Then I could build a custom dock that takes those pins and connects them to the data lines of an HDMI port.According to the USB specification, alternate modes must be negotiated by both sides first, using the USB-C Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol, to prevent them from interfering with devices that aren’t expecting them. I don’t actually have a USB-PD controller in Game Bub (too much added complexity), so I took a shortcut: have a microcontroller in the dock communicate with the Game Bub over regular USB and perform a handshake before enabling HDMI output from the FPGA. Once Game Bub detects that it’s been disconnected from the dock, it can just switch back to using the internal display.I realized that the dock also presents another opportunity for controller support. I originally wanted to build wireless controller support into the handheld, but the ESP32-S3 only supports Bluetooth Low Energy, and the majority of controllers use Bluetooth Classic. Fortunately, the Raspberry Pi Pico W (with an RP2040 MCU) supports both types of Bluetooth, so I just decided to use that as the microcontroller on the dock. Game controllers connect to the dock over Bluetooth, and the Pico sends the controller inputs to the device. I wired up the  and  USB-C pins as a direct connection between the FPGA and the dock for low latency input.The RP2040 acts as the USB host, and Game Bub only needs to be a device. I also added a USB hub chip and some additional USB ports on the back of the dock to allow for wired controller support too. Just like with wireless controllers, the dock handles the direct controller communication, and just passes inputs back to the main Game Bub unit.Since the dock is so simple (comparatively), it only took about a day to design and lay out.I had also hoped to use the dock to solve another problem around HDMI output: HDMI sinks (monitors, TVs) pull the HDMI data lines up to 3.3 volts, and can actually backfeed power to the HDMI source. For Game Bub, this meant that a powered-off unit would turn itself on when connected over HDMI. I used a HDMI buffer chip in the dock to try to alleviate this problem, but the chip I used wasn’t actually properly suited to this use-case and interfered with video output, so I had to carefully rework the board to bypass the chip. I’ll have to fix it in a later revision.Bypassing the HDMI buffer chipAfter the rework, HDMI output worked! The rest of the features are still a work in progress.Game Bub PCB on the dock, connected to an external monitorCongratulations on reading this far! This writeup ended up being incredibly long, even with a lot of details left out.I’m proud of what I accomplished over the last year and a half: I met all of my goals to produce a polished handheld FPGA retrogaming device. I pushed my electrical engineering and product design skills to the limit, and learned a lot in the process. Professional product and hardware designers deserve  respect.I deliberately designed this project with lots of possible extension opportunities to keep me occupied for a long time. I worked hard to get to the point where I’m comfortable sharing Game Bub with the world, but I still have a long list of TODOs for the future.In the near term, I’m going to work on finishing the dock, implementing wireless controller support (and maybe wired). I plan to use the Bluepad32 library to do so.I also want to improve the accuracy of my Game Boy Advance emulator: my goal here is to someday pass the entire mGBA test suite. I hope that I can contribute back to the wonderful  community with my emulator, and I plan to write-up some of my research around the GBA cartridge interface and link port.I have a long list of mostly minor changes to make to the MCU firmware: improving UI render performance, bits of polish like low battery notifications, eliminating display glitching when reloading the FPGA, and that sort of thing. I also plan to add more utilities, like a cartridge dumper and save backup/restore feature.Some day, I want to emulate the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter over Wi-Fi, e.g. with ESP-NOW. This won’t be compatible with the original wireless adapter, unfortunately, since that uses raw 2.4 GHz modulation rather than Wi-Fi.I designed Game Bub with extremely low production volumes in mind, using off-the-shelf commodity parts to keep the overall cost down. However, there are a few things I would have liked to be able to do, but are only possible with much higher volumes:A better LCD module (likely custom): native landscape mode to avoid the need for triple-buffering. Ideally a 720x480 resolution display, to allow for 3x GBA scaling and filter effects.High-quality injection molded case and buttons: 3D printing is great for low volume production, but an injection molded case would be great. It would be more precise (allowing for tighter tolerances), stronger, and allow for significantly more color options.Custom battery pack: or at least customizing the length of the connector wire. The current solution is hacky and doesn’t make the best use of internal space, due to limited off-the-shelf battery options.Smaller BGA parts for SRAM and SDRAM to free up board space (and move internal signals to 1.8 volts): this is actually something that would be possible in smaller volumes too, if I were willing to send parts from Mouser or DigiKey to JLCPCB for assembly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Stone Age diet - What did our human ancestors eat? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ij-guv8GE0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3Ij-guv8GE0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What did man's ancestors eat? How did they prepare their food? How did their food contribute to their evolution and their anatomical and cognitive development? This film provides answers based on new research findings.

Food. Since the beginning of time, obtaining food has been one of the most important activities of mankind. Research using new methods for examining and analyzing human fossils reveals previously unknown facets of prehistoric man. The results demonstrate the central role that food plays in the anatomical, genetic and social evolution of humans.
Until the beginning of agriculture in the Neolithic period, the first humans fed on what nature provided for them. Their diet shaped their evolution and humanity as we know it today.
This two-part documentary invites you on a journey into the past and shows the complexity and diversity of prehistoric life based on scientific findings from around the world. Suzana Herculano-Houzel explains how the cooking of food influenced the mental performance of early humans. Delphine Vettese from the Natural History Museum in Paris shows how cutting techniques for mincing meat and scraping out bone marrow were passed down from generation to generation. João Zilhão and Ernestina Badal present the results of their research into prehistoric food remains.
From archaeological sites in the Dordogne to Portugal, the USA and Jordan, the film shows spectacular images of caves, semi-caves and other prehistoric sites in nature.

But after seven years of development, one of the world’s most expensive infrastructure projects remains largely empty. Located 60 miles outside Beijing, Xiongan is designed to ease pressure on the overcrowded and congested Chinese capital of more than 20 million people. So why are the streets of the new metropolis empty and will people move in?

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll explore how Kafka serves as a powerful platform for capturing real-time streaming data and how organizations are increasingly adopting Apache Iceberg table format to store data in data lakes and data warehouses. We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.

Next, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.

• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming
• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses
• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features
• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes
• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]

The obfuscated Gaia ID is just a Google account identifier.‎So, if you block someone on YouTube, you can leak their Google account identifier? I tested it out. I went to a random livestream, blocked a user and sure enough, it showed up in https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist‎The fallback name was set as their channel name  and the profile ID was their obfuscated Gaia ID ‎This was super strange to me because YouTube should never leak the underlying Google account of a YouTube channel. In the past, there's been several bugs to resolve these to an email address, so I was confident there was still a Gaia ID to Email in some old obscure Google product.
              Escalating this to 4 billion YouTube channels
            So, we can leak the Gaia ID of any live chat user, but can we escalate this to all channels on YouTube? As it turns out, when you click the 3 dots just to open the context menu, a request is fired:‎www.youtube.com

That  is nothing more than just base64 encoded protobuf, which is a common encoding format used throughout Google.‎If we try decoding that  params:$ echo -n "Q2lrcUp3b1lWVU5vY3pCd1UyRkZiMDVNVmpSdFpYWkNSa2RoYjB0QkVnc3pObGx1VmpsVFZFSnhZMUFBV0FGaUx3b1ZNVEV6T1RBM05EWTJOVE0zTmpjd016Y3dOVGt3RWhaVFJTMWhXVTlpTFhWRFp6QTFPWEZJVW1selgyOTNjQUElM0Q=" | base64

              The missing puzzle piece: Pixel Recorder
            I told my friend nathan about the YouTube Gaia ID leak and we started looking into old forgotten Google products since they probably contained some bug or logic flaw to resolve a Gaia ID to an email. Pixel Recorder was one of them. Nathan made a test recording on his Pixel phone and synced it to his Google account so we could access the endpoints on the web at https://recorder.google.com:‎When we tried sharing the recording to a test email, that's when it hit us:pixelrecorder-pa.clients6.google.com

This endpoint was taking in the obfuscated Gaia ID and... ‎We tested this with the obfuscated Gaia ID  we got from blocking that user on YouTube a while back and : OK

              A small problem: preventing notification to the target
            It seems that whenever we share a recording with a victim, they receive an email that looks like this:‎This is , and it would lower the impact of the bug quite a lot. On the share pop-up, there didn't seem to be any option to disable notifications.I tried leaking the full request proto via my tool req2proto, but there was nothing about disabling the email notification:syntax = ;

 java.com.google.wireless.android.pixel.recorder.protos;

;

 {
   recording_id = ;
   delete_obfuscated_gaia_ids = ;
  ShareUser update_shared_users = ;
   sharing_message = ;
}

 {
   obfuscated_gaia_id = ;
  java.com.google.wireless.android.pixel.recorder.sharedclient.acl.protos.ResourceAccessRole role = ;
   email = ;
}Even trying to add and remove the user at the same time didn't work, the email was still sent. But that's when we realized - if it's including our recording title in the email subject, perhaps it wouldn't be able to send an email if our recording title was too long.‎We hacked together a quick python script to test this out: requests

BASE_URL = 

headers = {
    : ,
    : ,
    : ,
    : 
}

():
    payload = 
    response = requests.post(BASE_URL +  + , headers=headers, data=payload)
     response.status_code != :
        (, response.json())
        exit()
    :
        response = response.json()
    :
        (, response.text)
        exit()

     response[][]

():
    x = *
    payload = 
    response = requests.post(BASE_URL +  + , headers=headers, data=payload)
     response.status_code != :
        (, response.json())
        exit()

():
    share_id = ()
    headers[] = ( )
    headers[] = ()
    uuid = get_recording_uuid(share_id)
    (, uuid)
    update_recording_title(uuid)
    ()

 __name__ == :
    main()... and the recording title was now 2.5 million letters long! There wasn't any server-side limit to the length of a recording name.‎Trying to share the recording with a different test user...

Usually, a specific codepoint is written as , where  is a number represented as uppercase hexadecimal.For simple latin-alphabet text, there is a one-to-one mapping between Unicode codepoints and characters that appear on-screen. For example,
 represents the character .For other writing systems, some on-screen characters may be represented by multiple codepoints. The character की
(in Devanagari script) is represented by a consecutive pairing of the codepoints  and .Unicode designates 256 codepoints as “variation selectors”, named VS-1 to VS-256. These have no on-screen representation of their own, but are used to modify
the presentation of the preceeding character.Most unicode characters do not have variations associated with them. Since unicode is an evolving standard and aims to be future-compatible,
variation selectors are supposed to be preserved during transformations, even if their meaning is not known by the code handling them.
So the codepoint  (“g”) followed by  (VS-2) renders as a lowercase “g”, exactly the same as  alone. But if you copy and paste it, the
variation selector will tag along with it.Since 256 is exactly enough variations to represent a single byte, this gives us a way to “hide” one byte of data in any other unicode codepoint.As it turns out, the Unicode spec does not specifically say anything about sequences
of multiple variation selectors, except to imply that they should be ignored during rendering.See where I’m going with this?We can concatenate a sequence of variation selectors together to represent any arbitrary byte string.For example, let’s say we want to encode the data [0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f], which represents the text “hello”. We can do this by
converting each byte into a corresponding variation selector, and then concatenating them together.To convert from a byte to a variation selector, we can do something like this Rust code:(byte: ) ->  {
     byte  {
        char::from_u32( byte ).unwrap()
    }  {
        char::from_u32( (byte ) ).unwrap()
    }
}
To encode a series of bytes, we can concatenate a number of these variation selectors after a base character.(base: , bytes: []) -> String {
     result  String::new();
    result.push(base);
     byte  bytes {
        result.push(byte_to_variation_selector(byte));
    }
    result
}
Then to encode the bytes [0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f], we can run:() {
    println(, encode(, [, , , , ]));
}
It just looks like a regular emoji, but try pasting it into the decoder.If we instead use the debug formatter, we see what’s going on:() {
    println(, encode(, [, , , , ]));
}
"😊\u{e0158}\u{e0155}\u{e015c}\u{e015c}\u{e015f}"
This reveals the characters that were “hidden” in the original output.Decoding is similarly straightforward.(variation_selector: ) -> Option {
     variation_selector  variation_selector ;
     (..).contains(variation_selector) {
        Some((variation_selector ) )
    }  (..).contains(variation_selector) {
        Some((variation_selector ) )
    }  {
        None
    }
}

(variation_selectors: ) -> Vec {
     result  Vec::new();
    
     variation_selector  variation_selectors.chars() {
         Some(byte)  variation_selector_to_byte(variation_selector) {
            result.push(byte);
        } result.is_empty() {
             result;
        }
            }

    result
}
 std::::from_utf8;

() {
     result  encode(, [, , , , ]);
    println(, from_utf8(decode(result)).unwrap()); }
Note that the base character does not need to be an emoji – the treatment of variation selectors is the same
with regular characters. It’s just more fun with emoji.To be clear, this is an abuse of unicode and you shouldn’t do it. If your mind is wandering to practical use cases for this, shut it down.That said, I can think of a couple of nefarious ways this could be (ab)used:1. Sneaking data past human content filtersSince data encoded this way are invisible once rendered, a human moderator or reviewer will not know they are there.There are techniques for using subtle variations in text to “watermark” a message, so that if it is sent to a number of people and then
leaked, it’s possible to trace it to the original recipient. Variation selector sequences are a way to do this that survives most copy/pastes
and allows arbitrary data density. You could go so far as to watermark  if you wanted to.Addendum: can an LLM decode it?Since this made it on Hacker News, some people have asked about how LLMs
deal with this hidden data.Generally, tokenizers  seem to preserve the variation selectors as tokens, so in theory the model has access to them.
OpenAI’s tokenizer is a good sanity check of this:Overall though, models don’t even seem willing to try decoding them internally. However, when paired with a code interpreter, some models are
actually able to solve them!Here’s an example of Gemini 2 Flash solving one in a remarkable seven seconds, using Codename Goose and

Developers of platforms such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT are generally good at plugging these security holes, but hackers keep finding new ways to poke through them again and again.On Monday, researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated a new way to override prompt injection defenses Google developers have built into Gemini—specifically, defenses that restrict the invocation of Google Workspace or other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data, such as incoming emails or shared documents. The result of Rehberger’s attack is the permanent planting of long-term memories that will be present in all future sessions, opening the potential for the chatbot to act on false information or instructions in perpetuity.More about the attack later. For now, here is a brief review of indirect prompt injections: Prompts in the context of large language models (LLMs) are instructions, provided either by the chatbot developers or by the person using the chatbot, to perform tasks, such as summarizing an email or drafting a reply. But what if this content contains a malicious instruction? It turns out that chatbots are so eager to follow instructions that they often take their orders from such content, even though there was never an intention for it to act as a prompt.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Adolf Hitler And The Women Who Loved Him</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llKuKjGQQUo</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/llKuKjGQQUo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hitler attracted fanatical devotion from all across German society, including women.

Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? Did anything go “bang” during the Big Bang? Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!

Shouldn’t the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What’s in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went “bang”? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. 

What can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe’s invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. 

As the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.

Finally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.

After two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichstätt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a "mission donation.” High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.

Lawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops’ Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: "People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.” Janssen regards such practices as "a form of obstruction of justice”. No consideration at all was given to the victims. 

So did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.

--

After witnessing a bird carrying a single golden hair, King Mark of Cornwall declared his future bride must have equally radiant locks. The only royal matching this description was Princess Isolde of Ireland. So the king sent Tristan, his bravest knight, to extend an olive branch to the royal family and deliver his proposal of marriage. Iseult Gillespie shares the tale of Tristan and Isolde.

Of that number, there were 4,060 boot drives and 301,120 data drives. This report will focus on those data drives as we review the Q4 2024 annualized failure rates (AFR), the 2024 failure rates, and the lifetime failure rates for the drive models in service as of the end of 2024. Along the way, we’ll share our observations and insights on the data presented, and, as always, we look forward to you doing the same in the comments section at the end of the post.Q4 2024 hard drive failure ratesAs of the end of 2024, Backblaze was monitoring 301,120 hard drives used to store data. For our evaluation, we removed from consideration 487 drives, as they did not meet the criteria to be included. We’ll discuss the criteria we used in the next section of this report. Removing these drives leaves us with 300,633 hard drives to analyze. The table below shows the annualized failure rates for Q4 2024 for this collection of drives.. Seagate 24TB drives (model: ST24000NM002H) arrived in early December. The 1,200 drives filled one Backblaze Vault with no failed drives through the end of Q4. The 24TB Seagate drives join the 20TB Toshiba and 22TB WDC drive models in the 20-plus capacity club as we continue to dramatically increase storage capacity while optimizing existing storage server space.Zero failures for the quarter. Five drive models had zero failures for the quarter starting with the 24TB Seagate drive model noted above. The others are the 4TB HGST (model: HMS5C4040ALE640), the 8TB Seagate (model: ST8000NM000A), the 14TB Seagate (model: ST14000NM000J), and the 16TB Seagate (model: ST16000NM002J). All of the zeroes come with the caveat of having a relatively small number of drives and drive days, but zero failures in a quarter is always a good thing.The 4TB drives are nearly extinct. The 4TB drive count decreased by another 1,774 drives in Q4. (I discussed exactly how we migrate them in more detail if you want to dig in.) The remaining ~4,000 drives should be gone by the end of Q1 2025. They will be replaced by the incoming 20TB, 22TB, and 24TB drives. It should be noted that out of the 4TB drives in operation in Q4, only one failed, so those 20-plus TB drives have a lot to live up to from a failure perspective.The quarterly failure rate is down. The AFR for Q4 dropped from 1.89% in Q3 to 1.35% in Q4. While all drive sizes delivered some improvement from Q3 to Q4, one of the primary drivers is the addition of over 14,000 new 20-plus TB drives. As a group, these drives delivered an AFR of 0.77% for the quarter.We noted earlier we removed 487 drives from consideration when we produced the table above covering Q4 2024. There are two primary reasons we did not consider these drive models.. These are drives of a given model that we monitor and collect Drive Stats data on, but are not considered production drives at this time. For example, drives undergoing certification testing to determine if they are performant enough for our environment are not included in our Drive Stats calculations.Insufficient data points. When we calculate the annualized failure rate for a drive model for a given period of time (quarterly, annual, or lifetime), we want to ensure we have enough data to reliably do so. Therefore we have defined criteria for a drive model to be included in the tables and charts for the specified period of time. Models that do not meet these criteria are not included in the tables and charts for the period in question.Regardless of whether or not a given drive model is included in the charts and tables, all of the data for all of the drives we use is included in our Drive Stats dataset which you can download by visiting our Drive Stats page.As with the Q4 quarterly results, we will apply these criteria to the annual and lifetime charts that follow in this report.2024 annual hard drive failure ratesAs of the end of 2024, Backblaze was monitoring 301,120 hard drives used to store data. We removed nine drive models consisting of 2,012 drives from consideration as they did not meet the annual criteria we have defined. This leaves us with 298,954 drives divided across 27 different drive models. The table below shows the AFRs for 2024 for this collection of drives.. There were no qualifying drive models with zero failures in 2024. That said, the 16TB Seagate (model: ST16000NM002J) got close by recording just one drive failure back in Q3, giving the drive an AFR of 0.22% for 2024. . During 2024, our data center techs installed 53,337 drives. If we assume there are 2,080 work hours a year (52 weeks times 40 hours), that math is , and that means our intrepid DC techs installed 26 drives per hour. Busy, busy, busy! While there were 1,200 new 24TB Seagate drives added in 2024, they were installed in early December and did not accumulate enough drive days to make the cut for the annual, or lifetime, tables. Including the 24TB Seagate drive, there were three models that missed out on being included in the 2024 annual tables, these drive models are listed below.As a reminder, a drive model needs to have over 250 drives by the end of Q4 and accumulate at least 50,000 drive days during 2024 to be included in the annual tables.Comparing Drive Stats for 2022, 2023, and 2024The table below compares the annual failure rates by drive model for each of the last three years. The table includes just those drive models which met the annual criteria as of the end of 2024. The data for each year is inclusive of that year only for the operational drive models present at the end of each year. The table is sorted by drive size and then AFR. The 2024 AFR for all drives listed was 1.57%, this is down from 1.70% in 2023.  We expect the overall failure rates to continue to fall in 2025, but we will be watching the following for indicators.
The failure rates of the 8TB and 12TB drive models. All of the models will exceed their five years of service. In general, the failure rate will noticeably increase as the drives exceed five years of service. And, while there are outliers like the current HGST 4TB drives, you can’t assume that will happen.The failure rates of the 14TB and 16TB drive models. These models are approaching middle age—three to five years in operation. This is where, according to the bathtub curve, their failure rates could gradually increase—but not as severely as when they exceed five years. The failure rates for the 20TB, 22TB, and 24TB drives models. These drives will enter the flat portion of the bathtub curve, that is where their failure rate should be the lowest.Annualized failure rates vs. drive sizeNow, we can dig into the numbers to see what else we can learn. We’ll start by looking at the quarterly annualized failure rate by drive size over the last three years.Let’s take a look at the different drive sizes and how they affect the overall annualized failure rate over time.. The 4TB (blue line) drives and 10TB (gold line) drives have had little impact over the last year on the overall failure rate as each finished the year with a relatively small number of drives. Still, the wild ride delivered by the 10TB drives keeps our DC techs on their toes. . The 8TB (gray line) drives and 12TB (purple line) drives range in age from five to eight years and as such their overall failure rates should be increasing over time. The 12TB drives are following that pattern moving up from about 1% AFR back in 2021 to just about 3% in 2024. The failure rates of the 8TB drives, while erratic from quarter-to-quarter, have a nearly flat trendline over the same period.. The 14TB (green line) and 16TB (azure* line) drives comprise 57% of the drives in service and on average they range in age from two to four years. They are in the prime of their working lives. As such, they should have low and stable failure rates, and as you can see, they do.*  Maybe azure isn’t quite right, but robin’s egg blue seemed a bit pretentious.. The 22TB (orange line) drives are in their early days as we continue to add more drives on a regular basis. Once the drive population settles down, we’ll have a better sense of the AFR direction. Still, the early results are solid with a lifetime AFR of 1.06%.Annualized failure rates vs. manufacturerOne of the more popular ways we can look at this data is by the drive manufacturer as we’ve done below.To complete the picture, the chart below uses the same data, but displays just the linear trendlines for each of the manufacturers over the same three-year period.. While the HGST trendline is not pretty, it doesn’t tell the entire story. Looking at the first chart, until Q4 2023, the HGST drives were at or below the average for all of the drives, that is all manufacturers. At that point, HGST has exceeded the average, and then some. The table below contains results for just the HGST drives for 2024. We’ve sorted them, high to low, by the 2024 AFR.As you can see, there are two 12TB drive models driving the high AFR for the HGST drives. The HUH721212ALN604 model began showing signs of an increased quarterly AFR in Q1 2023 and the HUH721212ALE604 model followed suit in Q3 2024. Without these drive models, the 2024 AFR for HGST drive would be 0.55%.. The quarterly AFR trendline decreased for the Seagate drives from 2022 through 2024. While the decrease was slight, from 2.25% to 2.0%, Seagate was the only manufacturer to do so. The decrease appears, at least in part, to be due to the removal of the Seagate 4TB drives during that period. . Over the 2022 to 2024 period, the quarterly AFR for the Toshiba drive models varied within a fairly narrow range between 0.80% and 1.52%, with most quarters hovering slightly around 1.2%. Most importantly, none of the individual drive models were outliers, as the highest quarterly AFR for any Toshiba drive model was 1.58%. We like consistency. . While WDC drive models delivered a similar level of consistency as the Toshiba models, they did so with a lower AFR each quarter. From 2022 through 2024, the range of quarterly AFR values for the WDC models was 0.0% to 0.85%. The 0.0% AFR was in Q1 2022 when none of the 12,207 WDC drives in operation failed during that quarter.Lifetime hard drive statsAs of the end of 2024, Backblaze was monitoring 301,120 hard drives used to store data. Applying our drive criteria noted above for the lifetime period, we removed 11 drive models consisting of 2,736 drives from consideration as they did not meet the lifetime criteria we defined. This leaves us with 298,230 drives divided across 25 different drive models. The table below shows the lifetime AFRs for this collection of drives.The current lifetime AFR for all of the drives is 1.31%. This is down from 1.46% in 2023. The drop is primarily due to the completion of the migration of the 4TB Seagate drives in 2024, which left us with only two of these drives still in operation as of the end of 2024. As a consequence, the 79 million drive days and over 5,600 drive failures racked up by the 4TB Seagate drives by the end of 2023 are not included in the data presented in the 2024 lifetime table above.  In the final table below, we’ve taken the lifetime table and sorted out the drive models that have a lifetime AFR of 1.50% or less by drive size.A couple of caveats as you review the table.There is enough data for each model to say the AFR values are solid. That said, everything could change tomorrow. In general, the hard drive failure rate follows the bathtub curve as the drives age—unless it doesn’t. Some drives refuse to fail as they age, like the 4TB HGST drives. Other drives are great, and then “hit the wall” and bend the failure curve upward, fast.A drive model with a 1% annualized failure rate means that you can expect one drive out of 100 to fail in a year. If you’re a personal drive user, that one drive could be yours. If you have exactly one drive, your personal annualized failure rate is 100%. In other words, always have a backup, and don’t forget to test it.I have been authoring the various Drive Stats reports for the past ten years and this will be my last one. I am retiring, or perhaps in Drive Stats vernacular, it would be “migrating.” Either way, after 10 years in the U.S. Air Force and 30+ years in Silicon Valley Tech, it is time. Drive Stats will continue with Stephanie Doyle and David Johnson as the replacement drive models beginning with the Q1 2025 report. I wish them well.I want to say thank you to each of you who have taken your time to peruse and engage with the Drive Stats reports and data over the last 10 years. And, thank you as well for the comments, questions, and discussions that raced and raged across the various communities that care about something as mundane and awesome as a hard drive. It has been quite the ride—thanks again.The Hard Drive Stats dataThe complete data set used to create the tables and charts in this report is available on our Hard Drive Test Data page. You can download and use this data for free for your own purpose. All we ask are three things: 1) you cite Backblaze as the source if you use the data, 2) you accept that you are solely responsible for how you use the data, and 3) you do not sell this data itself to anyone; it is free.Good luck, and let us know if you find anything interesting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boring tech is mature, not old</title><link>https://rubenerd.com/boring-tech-is-mature-not-old/</link><author>mikece</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:08:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve talked before about how I think NetBSD is “boring”, and that it’s among the highest forms of praise I can give tech as a sysadmin and architect. But I’ve never elaborated why that is.The opposite of being bored is to be surprised, and that’s not something a sysadmin desires when building, maintaining, scaling, troubleshooting, upgrading, or even replacing a complex system… especially when you’re woken up at 03:30 by a monitoring server. That’s also why the phrase work doing what you love and you never work a day again in your life is an empty platitude of nonsense. But I digress.Boring tech behaves in predictable ways. It’s a well trodden path others have evaluated, optimised, troubleshooted, and understood. Using tech that has been subjected to all those people hours of use means you’re less likely to run into edge cases, unexpected behaviour, or attributes and features that lack documentation or community knowledge. In other words, when something goes wrong, can you turn to someone or something?Likewise, tech (generally) doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It interacts with other components and systems, some of which are even conveniently under our control, sometimes. Multiply out the potential for surprises by the number of components and their relative maturity, and your head can start to spin.This isn’t to say there isn’t room for innovation, or that staying put is a guaranteed recipe for success. What it does teach is that it pays to make informed decisions, and that often times the understood, reliable, boring tech will get you there over something new, shiny or propped up with marketing spin. The number of people I’ve talked with who’ve replaced complicated K8s clusters with a few VMs and seen massive improvements in reliability, cost, and uptime would make some people at the Orange Peanut Gallery more than a little perturbed, for example.I used to agree with this. Now I don’t think so any more. You should prefer “boring” tech, and boring should be read as has been around for a while and therefore is well understood.Ubiquity is a bad test for well-understood technology. Age as a test for ubiquity is also bad.There are a few assumptions here:Boring should be read as something being around for a while. I wouldn’t necessarily agree with that. I’ve been a DBA, and I never in a million years would call Oracle “boring”. It’s fiendishly complicated and difficult to maintain, and commands above-average salaries in part for that reason. A sign saying “there be Ellison dragons” isn’t boring, it’s frankly terrifying.Ubiquity is a test for “boringness”. He’s right here; while age gives something an opportunity to become ubiquitous, it’s not a guarantee. I’d look to the BSDs here; I’d consider them boring, but they’re not exactly widely deployed compared to Penguins.Boring should be read as well-understood. That’s true. Time gives something more of a chance of being well-understood, until suddenly it doesn’t and nobody is around with sufficient knowledge and inclination to maintain your COBOL stack. At that stage, I’d say you have a decidedly  issue on your hands.I’d conclude by suggesting boring tech isn’t old, but . Maturity not just in the software, but its documentation, community, and track record.  is often used as an analogue for maturity, but it’s not the same thing. Otherwise I’d be more mature than my Zoomer friends, and I very much doubt that to be the case. .This is why I don’t hesitate to call NetBSD boring, and why I say that’s a compliment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How artificial light affects animals | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYYw87lpn-A</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hYYw87lpn-A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The use of artificial light at night has been around for far longer than you would think, dating back to the discovery of fire.  

Since then, humans have made use of different kinds of torches to navigate the world at night. From the Egyptians to the Romans, to the Chinese, oil lamps were common in the cities of ancient civilizations. The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. 

But most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn’t only true for nocturnal creatures. We are also affected by exposure to artificial light and can develop serious conditions because of it, like sleep disorders, diabetes and even cancer.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]

In 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, avian flu began aggressively circulating in wildlife. Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be?

The server retains some data from previous requests, making future interactions dependent on past state.In software systems,  refers to any data that persists across requests, such as user sessions, shopping carts, or authentication details.The choice between stateless and stateful architecture can affect scalability, performance, complexity, and cost.In this article, we’ll break down both the approaches, their advantages and trade-offs, and when to use each—with real-world examples.In a , the system remembers client or process data () across multiple requests.Once a client connects, the server holds on to certain details—like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication sessions—so the client doesn’t need to resend everything with each request.Stateful systems typically store the state data in a database or in-memory storage. During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections. If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.Common Patterns in Stateful ArchitectureIf you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.2. Centralized Session StoreA more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). : All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.Personalized Experiences: Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions. Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect. Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data. Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions. Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges. If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.E-commerce Shopping Carts – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube) – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack) – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.Every request must include all necessary information for processing.Once the server responds, it discards any temporary data used for that request.: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):Client Authenticates Once: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token> header).: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors. A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically. Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions. Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage. The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.Easier to Cache Responses: Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses. Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate. Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.Microservices Architecture: Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.When to Choose Stateful ArchitectureStateful systems are ideal when user context and continuity are critical. Consider a stateful approach if your application:Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.When to Choose Stateless ArchitectureStateless systems work best when scalability, simplicity, and resilience are top priorities. Use a stateless approach if your application:Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficientlyDoesn’t require storing client-specific data between requestsNeeds fast, distributed processing without server dependenciesMust ensure reliability and failover readiness A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both WorldsMany modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.This hybrid approach allows:Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalabilityStateful sessions for personalization, improving user experienceExternal session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

      Junyang Shao, on behalf of the Go team
      11 February 2025
      Today the Go team is excited to release Go 1.24,
which you can get by visiting the download page.Go 1.24 comes with many improvements over Go 1.23. Here are some of the notable
changes; for the full list, refer to the release notes.Several performance improvements in the runtime have decreased CPU overhead
by 2–3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks. These
improvements include a new builtin  implementation based on
Swiss Tables, more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.The  command now provides a mechanism for tracking tool dependencies for a
module. Use  to add a  directive to the current module. Use
 to run the tools declared with the  directive.
Read more on the go command in the release notes.The new  analyzer in  subcommand reports common mistakes in
declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages.
Read more on vet in the release notes.Standard library additionsImproved WebAssembly supportGo 1.24 adds a new  directive for Go programs to export
functions to the WebAssembly host, and supports building a Go program as a WASI
reactor/library.
Read more on WebAssembly in the release notes.Please read the Go 1.24 release notes for the complete and
detailed information. Don’t forget to watch for follow-up blog posts that
will go in more depth on some of the topics mentioned here!Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release by writing code and
documentation, reporting bugs, sharing feedback, and testing the release
candidates. Your efforts helped to ensure that Go 1.24 is as stable as possible.

The feature is similar to the TamperMonkey and GreaseMonkey browser extensions, notes BleepingComputer. From the report: "Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience," explained Brave in the announcement. Brave says that the feature was initially created to debug the browser's adblock feature but felt it was too valuable not to share with users. Brave's custom scriptlets feature can be used to modify webpages for a wide variety of privacy, security, and usability purposes.
 
For privacy-related changes, users write scripts that block JavaScript-based trackers, randomize fingerprinting APIs, and substitute Google Analytics scripts with a dummy version. In terms of customization and accessibility, the scriptlets could be used for hiding sidebars, pop-ups, floating ads, or annoying widgets, force dark mode even on sites that don't support it, expand content areas, force infinite scrolling, adjust text colors and font size, and auto-expand hidden content.
 
For performance and usability, the scriptlets can block video autoplay, lazy-load images, auto-fill forms with predefined data, enable custom keyboard shortcuts, bypass right-click restrictions, and automatically click confirmation dialogs. The possible actions achievable by injected JavaScript snippets are virtually endless. However, caution is advised, as running untrusted custom scriptlets may cause issues or even introduce some risk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech is supposed to make our lives easier (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/131</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/131/changelog-news-131.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bill Maher excoriates the software industry for making our lives more difficult, two professors from the University of Washington put together a curriculum to help us manage life in the ChatGPT world, Daniel Delaney thinks deeply on chat as a dev tool UI, Benedict Evans explores our assumptions that computers be ‘correct’ & the Thoughtbot team writes up six cases when not to refactor.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

The ChatGPT creator plans to send its chip designs to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for fabrication within the next few months, but the chip has not yet been formally announced.The OpenAI chip's full capabilities, technical details, and exact timeline are still unknown, but the company reportedly intends to iterate on the design and improve it over time, giving it leverage in negotiations with chip suppliers—and potentially granting the company future independence with a chip design it controls outright.In the past, we've seen other tech companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, create their own AI acceleration chips for reasons that range from cost reduction to relieving shortages of AI chips supplied by Nvidia, which enjoys a near-market monopoly on high-powered GPUs (such as the Blackwell series) for data center use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Musk-led group makes $97B bid for control of OpenAI</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/elon-musk-led-group-makes-974-billion-bid-control-openai-wsj-reports-2025-02-10/</link><author>jdoliner</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 20:42:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Philip Goff &amp; Helen De Cruz on Finding (and Losing) Their Religion | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrgbZVLpc1I</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qrgbZVLpc1I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two notable Closer To Truth contributors—and two good friends—discuss their intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual journeys in what seems to be opposite directions: one toward a form of Christianity and the other away from it.

Fundamentally, when one device needs to send data to another device, it needs to know how to address it. On IP-based networks, devices are addressed using an IP address. Unfortunately, the number of connected devices has long outpaced the number of unique addresses in the IPv4 address space. Because of this, public IP addresses have to be shared between devices, which causes a few problems.How to Share an IP AddressYou probably accessed this blog post from a machine that does not have a public IP address. Rather, it has been assigned a private IP address on a network, perhaps via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and it talks to a router that is responsible for sending data to and from the device. To access this post, your device first had to use the Domain Name System (DNS) to map a public IP address to , then had to send a request to that IP address for the content of this page.When that request arrives at a router or some other intermediary, it knows where to deliver the request because the IP address of the server hosting  is specified. It forwards the request along, and the server responds with the requested content. However, the server does not know that your device sent the request. The router has replaced the private IP address and port from your device with its own public IP address and port, and it has made an entry in a translation table noting that incoming data for that port should be directed to your device. The server sends the content back to the router, which replaces its own public IP address and port with your device’s IP address and port, then forwards it along. The content arrives at your device, appearing as though the server sent it directly to you. Meanwhile, the router is doing the same song and dance for many other devices, maintaining all of the mappings from its own IP address and ports to internal IP addresses and ports. This is known as Network Address Translation (NAT).This works great in simple request-response scenarios like fetching a blog post from a server with a public IP address. However, what if the server wants to say something to the device before the device talks to it? The server may know the public IP address of the router, but the router has no way of knowing which device the message is actually intended for. There is no entry in the NAT translation table until an  message creates one. This also becomes a problem in peer-to-peer scenarios, where both devices are on a private network, making it such that neither device can talk to the other (this is solved using a public rendezvous point, such as a STUN server, but that’s a story for another post).Another problem is that routers don’t want to maintain mappings forever. At some point if no outgoing messages have been observed, the entry will be removed from the translation table and any subsequent incoming traffic will be dropped. In many cases, this timeout is quite aggressive (e.g. 5 minutes or less). Typically this is resolved by sending “keep alive” messages, ensuring that entries are not removed and data can flow freely in both directions. For your laptop or a server in a data center that might work fine for the most part. For highly constrained devices, it can quickly drain battery or consume precious limited bandwidth.Maybe you decide that its okay for incoming traffic to be dropped after some period of time, as long as when you next contact the server you are able to re-establish a mapping and fetch any data that you need. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the router, or any other layer in the hierarchy of intermediaries performing NAT (it’s actually much more complicated, with  adding even more translation steps), will assign you the same public IP address and port. Therefore, when you try to continue talking to the server over a previously established session, it will not recognize you. This means you’ll have to re-establish the session, which typically involves expensive cryptographic operations and sending a handful of messages back and forth before actually delivering the data you were interested in sending originally.The worst case scenario is that your device needs to send data somewhat frequently, but not frequently enough that NAT mappings are maintained. For example, if a device needs to send a tiny sensor reading every 30 minutes, and the NAT timeout is 5 minutes, it will either need to send a keep alive message every 5 minutes (that’s 5x the messages you actually need to send!), or it will need to re-establish the session every time it delivers a reading. In both cases, you are going to be using much more power than if you were just able to send your sensor reading alone every 30 minutes.Unfortunately, the distributed nature of the internet means that we aren’t going to be able to address the issue by nicely asking carriers and ISPs to extend their NAT timeouts. However, we  make it such that being issued a new IP address and port doesn’t force us to re-establish a session.More than a year ago, we announced support for DTLS 1.2 Connection IDs. DTLS provides a secure transport over UDP, which many devices, especially those that are power constrained, use to communicate with Golioth’s CoAP device APIs. Typically, DTLS sessions are established based on a “five tuple”: source address, source port, transport protocol, destination address, destination port. If any of these change, a handshake must be performed to establish a new session. To mitigate this overhead, a Connection ID can be negotiated during the initial handshake, and can be used in subsequent records to continue to associate messages even after changes in source IP or port.Going back to our previous example of a device that sends a single sensor reading message every 30 minutes, enabling Connection ID would mean that a new handshake would not have to be performed after NAT timeout, and that single message can be sent then the device can go back to sleep. In fact, depending on how long the server is willing to store connection state, the device could sleep for much longer, sending once a day or more infrequently. This doesn’t solve the issue of cloud to device traffic being dropped after NAT timeout (check back for another post on that topic), but for many low power use cases, being able to sleep for an extended period of time is more important than being able to immediately push data to devices.Configuring the Golioth Firmware SDK for Sleepy DevicesBy default, the Golioth Firmware SDK will send keep alive messages to ensure that an entry is preserved in the NAT translation table. However, this functionality can be disabled by setting CONFIG_GOLIOTH_COAP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL to 0, or just modifying it to be set to a large upper bound.CONFIG_GOLIOTH_COAP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_S=0If using Zephyr, we’ll also need to set the receive timeout to a value greater than the interval at which we will be sending data. Otherwise, the client will attempt to reconnect after 30 seconds by default if it has not received any messages. In this example we’ll send data every 130 seconds, so setting the receive timeout to 200 ensures that we won’t attempt to reconnect between sending.CONFIG_GOLIOTH_COAP_CLIENT_RX_TIMEOUT_SEC=200To demonstrate the impact of NAT timeouts, we’ll initially build the  example without enabling Connection IDs. To ensure that we wait long enough for a NAT timeout, we need to update the loop to send every 130 seconds instead of every 5 seconds.while (true)

    LOG_INF("Sending hello! %d", counter);

    ++counter;
    k_sleep(K_SECONDS(130));

The book is titled  , and here is how it turned out:My wife is delighted with it, so it was worth all the effort.This post will take you through the process. It will be a long one, but please stick around - I promise there will be a lot of pretty pictures.Here is the outline of the post:I had this idea for a while after seeing something similar somewhere on the internet.. Since then, I always wanted to make one for my wife - a physically small book with a bunch of small drawings of our memories together, inside jokes, and little things she likes.I wanted the illustrations to be hand-drawn, and I had a plan to ask my friend to do them. But I knew he would refuse any kind of payment, so I felt bad adding more work to his plate. So I shelved the idea, but every now and then, it would pop up in my head.Fast forward a few years - we got a kid, and our routine completely changed. We are enjoying it a lot, but it can be very exhausting, and every day seems identical to the last. That's why I decided I needed to do something for her to break the routine. The book idea seemed perfect - personal and handcrafted - so I gave it a try.To be able to do everything myself, I went to create digital drawings and then draw them on paper using my trusty pen plotter.With the idea in place, I moved on to creating the drawings - which turned out to be a challenge of its own.For pen plotting, one needs vector files, so I started drawing in Figma. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that my drawing skills would not get me the result I had envisioned. Determined to do it this time, I decided to try using AI to generate images.I got myself a Midjourney subscription and started playing with it. It took a lot of failed attempts to figure out how to get drawings that were simple and had a strong hand-drawn feel to them. Even then, I ended up editing every one of them, but more on that later.One of the first images I was satisfied with (it didn't end up in the book, though):It took a lot of time, but it was fun. Failed attempts were often quirky and funny, and I was learning how to use the tool. And it made me feel like a secret agent, doing it next to my wife, who had no idea what I was up to.I may be wrong, but I think Midjourney wasn't built for the kind of illustrations I had in mind. I was after simple, hand-drawn illustrations that felt personal. Luckily, I found a style reference () that worked well for my case. I used it to generate almost all of the drawings that ended up in the book. For those who haven't used Midjourney - you can use images as style references to influence the style of images you want to generate.Most of my images were generated using that  code and a  between 150 and 400 (it can go from 0 to 1000).As for the prompts, these are the key terms I combined with the description and the style reference:isolated on white backgroundIt took me a lot of tries - between 10 and 30 attempts for each image you see in the book.Once I solved the image generation part, I had to figure out how to turn them into vector files for plotting. The first thing I tried was something similar to halftone. As you can see below, in this process, the images completely lost the hand-drawn feel.Then I remembered this plot of Marble Machine X I did a while ago, for which I used AutoTrace to convert the original image to a vector file. The great thing about AutoTrace is that it supports "centerline tracing". And this time, I learned that Inkscape has a great AutoTrace plugin, which made it even easier to convert.What makes centerline tracing differentMost of the tools that convert raster to vector images do it by outlining shapes. This is not suitable for plotting, as each line in the original image becomes a sausage-like shape. Centerline tracing, on the other hand, tries to draw a single line following the middle path through shapes. Don't worry if it sounds confusing; the example below should make things clearer.Here is the image of Link from  generated by Midjourney:After applying a common vectorization technique, we get this. As you can see, each line in the original drawing is now outlined, creating this messy-looking image.But if we use centerline tracing, it suddenly looks a lot more like a drawing. It is not perfect, but don't worry - we are going to clean it up in the next step.In the points where lines touch or cross, AutoTrace is not sure which line to follow and creates these funky-looking joints. Here is an exaggerated example to show you what I'm talking about. Input is the raster image at the top and the vectorized result is at the bottom:But I found out that if I roughly separate these lines, I get a much better result.Let's now apply this technique to the image of Link we've seen above. After separating lines (and some cleaning up) this is the image I ended up with. It is rough, but it is only used as an input for the tracing process, so it doesn't really matter. This was manual and somewhat tedious process, but I enjoyed it overall. It was a sort of meditation for me.And finally, when we trace this image, we get a really nice and clean vector file perfect for plotting. Here is another example. We start with the image I generated using Midjourney:After editing, removing details and separating lines, we get this one:And the traced vector result:You'll notice that in both examples I did  . I did that for pretty much all of the images, to fix things I wasn't able to polish using prompts. I also removed a lot of details to make sure images are crisp and readable at the small size.All of this took a lot of experimentation, but it gave me a pretty solid workflow which I used to generate all of the images. The complete flow looks like this:Generate images using Midjourney.Upscale them two times, because upscaled images were easier to edit and tracing was more precise.Clean up, redraw and separate lines by hand using Gimp.Use Inkscape plugin to run AutoTrace centerline tracing.It took me a while to generate all the images, and the fact that I was trying to keep it a secret from my wife didn't help. I think I did it over the span of two weeks, mostly in the evening after she would go to bed. never stood a chance!Before we continue I just want to show you two funky images of Link that really made me laugh:With the drawings ready, I turned to the next crucial part - the text. I first wanted to write everything by hand, photograph it and then vectorize it in the same way I did with the images. But it was a hassle - I had to do a lot of editing for text to look as my handwriting.Evil Mad Scientist, the maker of my pen plotter, has a fantastic tool called Hershey Text. It contains a bunch of single-line fonts ideal for plotting. I chose the EMS Elfin font as it looked playful and hand-drawn. I used it to write all of the text in the book and I think it turned out great.The tricky part with bookbinding is that pages are not printed in order, but in a way that when you fold the sheets in half, you get the right order. I used Figma to design the layout, with a great care to make sure pages are in order after double-sided plotting.Here is the layout laid out on A4 sized paper. Sorry for blurring the text, but a lot of it is very personal and I want to keep it for our eyes only.Plotting is the part that went the smoothest, but not without hiccups. I usually use Pigma Micron blackliner markers. They use archival quality ink and they are literally indestructible. But this time, even the thinnest one I had was too thick for the book this small.Here you can see the first  using markers of 0.2mm and 0.1mm thickness respectively. Lines got a bit smudged and looked much thicker than I expected. This was also the moment I realized I need to remove  from the images to make them readable at this size.I needed to find a thinner pen.Technical pen to the rescueBlackliner markers were made as a more practical replacement for technical pens. But from what I've read, an old-school technical pen was the only thing capable of achieving super-fine lines I wanted. I went online and ordered Rotring Isograph 0.2mm. As soon as it arrived I sneaked out to my study and did another test plot using it. Oh boy, was I happy when I saw the result:Lines were thin and crisp and at this point I was convinced the project will be a success!All of the first plots were done on 120gsm printer paper. It is somewhat thick paper and drawings looked fantastic. Unfortunately, when I bound the pages together, the drawings and letters would get transferred on the opposite pages. I could probably get away with it, considering the whole hand made feel of the book. But I wanted it to be perfect.A friend advised me to leave ink to dry for a few hours. I left each side to dry for 24 hours, but it smudged again. Next time I tried putting the plot (before cutting the pages) between two sheets of papers and pressing it with heavy books. I did that for more than 24 hours, but still after cutting and bounding the pages, they got smudged again. At this point I was becoming somewhat desperate. As the last resort I ordered different, 100gsm paper and to my relief it worked! Crisis averted!In the final version you can still see tiny traces on a few pages, but these are barely visible and don't really bother me.After plotting and cutting I was left with a stack of somewhat delicate pages. Now, it was finally time to turn them into a book.As you can imagine, I had zero bookbinding experience. There are a lot of resources online, but two of them were crucial for my project as they were on how to bind tiny books:After reading and watching these and a few generic articles on bookbinding, I gathered enough info to try doing it myself. I thought I was super clever because I 3D printed sides and spine of the book. I designed sewing holes in the spine so I can connect the pages directly to it without using glue. It was a decent idea, but it left a gap between two  . Still, I went with it for the first try.I laid everything down on the canvas that the book would be wrapped in and started assembling it. But I made a crucial mistake - I used super glue. It dries quickly, it is stiff, and doesn't glue 3D printed plastic well and it dissolved the paper I used. Long story short, I made a mess. But I didn't stress too much, I just proclaimed that version is a prototype and used it as a learning experience.I ordered proper bookbinding glue (PVA). While I was waiting for it, I focused on properly sewing the pages together.The first time I sewed the pages together, I poked the holes by hand and they were somewhat uneven. Again, it was nothing major, but I didn't like it. So I designed and 3D printed a simple tool to help me drill the holes evenly.The tool has two parts, and the pages fit snugly between them. Both top and bottom parts have holes, so I was able to put the needle through and poke perfectly even holes in the pages. I'm very proud of this silly contraption.Here you can see all of the eight sheets with sewing holes.Fun fact, I designed all 3D parts using JavaScript and Replicad library. Here is a link if you want to play with the model in your browser.But I ditched the 3D printed spine and used the technique called , which works great when you have only two signatures. It made signatures way more tight than when I connected them separately to the 3D printed spine.When the glue arrived, I plotted everything again and took it from the top. I swapped 3D printed sides for cardboard. Using proper glue was a game changer. I had enough time to apply it before it hardened, and when it dried it stayed flexible. And when it got onto my fingers, it was easy to remove. Everything was much cleaner, and I finally managed to put it all together.Unfortunately, I was rushing to finish the book, so I didn't take any photos of the process. But here are a few I do have:If you are an experienced bookbinder and reading this, I'm sorry for the bookbinding crimes I probably committed. I promise I won't use super glue again.It looked great! It was not perfect (more on that below), but I was super happy with how it turned out. It had a distinct handcrafted feel to it, the images turned out fantastic, and I think I really managed to bring out a personal touch with it.On the day I finished the book and gave it to my wife, we were both exhausted (our kid was teething, and we had a very rough night), so I thought she would appreciate a little pick-me-up.When I gave it to her, the first thing she asked was, "Will I cry?". She was brave, but it definitely got her all mushy and made her day. After reading, she carefully put it on the shelf, out of the reach of the little one.Then I asked her if she ever suspected I was preparing a surprise for her, and she said that she had no idea. But she also said that she thought it was weird that I would often plot something and not brag about it to her afterwards. It was true, I love showing her my work, but luckily she didn't give it too much thought, and I was able to finish my secret project.One thing I would like to fixLike I mentioned, the book isn't perfect. The sides are a bit too large, so the pages seem too deep inside when the book is closed. For the same reason, the end pages turned out to be a bit short, which gives it a weird, uneven look. It is purely aesthetic, but I think it is the only thing keeping it from being perfect.Lesson learned if I ever end up doing something similar.It took way longer than it should have—it took me a month and a half to finish it. It took so long because I did it in secrecy, which meant working late in the evenings when my wife and kid were asleep. A bunch of little failures... ehm, I mean  also prolonged the project. And finally, I had to order multiple things, so I was blocked a few times while I was waiting for four different deliveries.But the final assembly took me around two and a half hours from start to finish - plotting, cutting, sewing, and bookbinding. Mostly because I had already practiced all of them and defined the exact process.It was so much fun. I love projects that span across multiple disciplines. This one touched AI, drawing, plotting, modeling, 3D printing, sewing, and bookbinding. I encountered a lot of little hiccups, but I also learned about all of them. Some of the errors I made could have been avoided if I had been more patient. But I hope you'll cut me some slack - I was super excited and eager to see how it would turn out, and I had limited time windows when I could do it in secrecy. Still, I need to take it as a lesson - being patient will help me save time when doing projects like this one.The highlight for me was that I could do it without an illustrator. Love it or hate it, AI ended up being a fantastic tool that filled the gap in my skill set, which was crucial for making the book.I hope you enjoyed this write-up as much as I enjoyed making the book and writing the post. And I do hope I inspired you to try making something of your own.

And they’re still one of the most efficient ways to store data.” Yet open questions remain about how they work, he said. “This paper answers a couple of them in surprising ways.”Hash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They’re designed to allow users to do exactly three things: “query” (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?The answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage — this table is 50% full, that one’s 90% — but researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by , to specify how close the hash table is to 100% full. If  is 100, then the table is 99% full. If  is 1,000, the table is 99.9% full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.Researchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion — putting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot — is proportional to . “If your hash table is 99% full,” Kuszmaul said, “it makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.”In a 1985 paper, the computer scientist Andrew Yao, who would go on to win the A.M. Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly — an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than . for 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,”  he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table — one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log ) — far faster than . This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log ) is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said Guy Blelloch of Carnegie Mellon.“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said Sepehr Assadi of the University of Waterloo.  “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>92-year-old describes her morning walk 🐿️ #JoyRidePBS #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFMv_UH6fcg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cFMv_UH6fcg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brigitta Bexelius, 92, starts her days at Wood Glen Hall in Santa Barbara with a walk, where she gets to enjoy nature.

Why is this happening?

In the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.

The claim that human beings have or are an ‘immortal soul’ goes back to the ancient Greeks, if not further. In a pre-scientific world, it would seem absurd for our inner awareness not to continue, irrespective of what happens to our bodies. Today science rejects the soul, yet there are diverse viewpoints around.

It is so called generative art: I write the software, and the software creates art autonomously. 
            A nice introduction into generative art is this talk by Tim Holman.
          
          In a gallery in London, I came across gorgeaus screenprints by Ricky Byrne. I loved their use of color and hand-produced feel. Attention for color, layout, tension.
          So I started experimenting with maze generation algorithms in Rust, with Nannou.
          In the process, I decided to make it a web app, for valentine, so everyone can create their own maze. And ported the Rust code to TypeScript in a tiny web app. The Coding Train has a great tutorial set on maze generation. I used the same common recursive backtracking algorithm, because the aesthetics are what I was looking for. 
          The names you provide are used to generate unique randomnes. 
          This is used in a maze generation algorithm to create a maze. 
          I deliberately chose to animate the maze generation, to show the process. It is a slow process, but I think it is interesting to watch it carve out your maze. 
          Saving, copying and sharing the maze is disabled until the maze is generated. Once the maze is generated, you can save, copy and share the maze. 
          Sharing, copying won't work on all browsers and is affected by some browser plugins or settings. The best result is on Chrome on Android. 
          , the only parameter you can provide is the names. The maze is generated based on these names, and the algorithm is fixed. This is by design. Only the two names determine the artwork. 
            However, you can change the source code, see below.
          
            The code is available on GitHub. Feel free to fork, change and improve it, or just have fun with it.

For that reason, we're launching the Anthropic Economic Index, an initiative aimed at understanding AI's effects on labor markets and the economy over time.The Index’s initial report provides first-of-its-kind data and analysis based on millions of anonymized conversations on Claude.ai, revealing the clearest picture yet of how AI is being incorporated into real-world tasks across the modern economy.We're also open sourcing the datasetused for this analysis, so researchers can build on and extend our findings. Developing policy responses to address the coming transformation in the labor market and its effects on employment and productivity will take a range of perspectives. To that end, we are also inviting economists, policy experts, and other researchers to provide input on the Index.The main findings from the Economic Index’s first paper are:Today, usage is concentrated in software development and technical writing tasks. Over one-third of occupations (roughly 36%) see AI use in at least a quarter of their associated tasks, while approximately 4% of occupations use it across three-quarters of their associated tasks.AI use leans more toward augmentation (57%), where AI collaborates with and enhances human capabilities, compared to automation (43%), where AI directly performs tasks.AI use is more prevalent for tasks associated with mid-to-high wage occupations like computer programmers and data scientists, but is lower for both the lowest- and highest-paid roles. This likely reflects both the limits of current AI capabilities, as well as practical barriers to using the technology.See below for further details on our initial findings.Mapping AI usage across the labor marketOur new paper builds on a long line of research on the labor market impact of technologies, from the Spinning Jenny of the Industrial Revolution to the car-manufacturing robots of the present day. We focus on the ongoing impact of AI. We don’t survey people on their AI use, or attempt to forecast the future; instead, we have direct data on how AI is actually being used.Analyzing occupational tasksOur research began with an important insight from the economics literature: sometimes it makes sense to focus onrather than. Jobs often share certain tasks and skills in common: for example, visual pattern recognition is a task performed by designers, photographers, security screeners, and radiologists.Certain tasks lend themselves better to being automated or augmented by a new technology than others. We’d therefore expect AI to be adopted selectively for different tasks across different occupations, and that analyzing tasks—in addition to jobs as a whole—would give us a fuller picture of how AI is being integrated into the economy.Using Clio to match AI use to tasksThis research was made possible by Claude insights and observations, or"Clio", an automated analysis tool that allows us to analyze conversations with Claude while preserving user privacy. We used Clio on a dataset of approximately one million conversations with Claude (specifically, Free and Pro conversations on Claude.ai), and used it to organize the conversations by occupational task.We chose tasks according to the classification made by the U.S. Department of Labor, which maintains a database of around 20,000 specific work-related tasks called the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. Clio matched each conversation with the O*NET task that best represented the role of the AI in the conversation (the process is summarized in the figure below). We then followed the O*NET scheme for grouping the tasks into the occupations they best represented, and the occupations into a small set of overall categories:  and so on. The tasks and occupations with by far the largest adoption of AI in our dataset were those in the “computer and mathematical” category, which in large part covers software engineering roles. 37.2% of queries sent to Claude were in this category, covering tasks like software modification, code debugging, and network troubleshooting.The second largest category was “arts, design, sports, entertainment, and media” (10.3% of queries), which mainly reflected people using Claude for various kinds of writing and editing. Unsurprisingly, occupations involving a high degree of physical labor, such as those in the “farming, fishing, and forestry” category (0.1% of queries), were least represented.We also compared the rates in our data to the rates at which each occupation appeared in the labor market in general. The comparisons are shown in the figure below.Depth of AI use within occupations. Our analysis found that very few occupations see AI use across most of their associated tasks: only approximately 4% of jobs used AI for at least 75% of tasks. However, more moderate use of AI is much more widespread: roughly 36% of jobs had some use of AI for at least 25% of their tasks.As we predicted, there wasn’t evidence in this dataset of jobs being entirely automated: instead, AI was diffused across the many tasks in the economy, having stronger impacts for some groups of tasks than others. The O*NET database provides the median U.S. salary for each of the occupations listed. We added this information to our analysis, allowing us to compare professions’ median salaries and the level of AI use in their corresponding tasks.Interestingly, both low-paying and very-high-paying jobs had very low rates of AI use (these were generally jobs involving a large degree of manual dexterity, such as shampooers and obstetricians). It was specific occupations in the mid-to-high median salary ranges, like computer programmers and copywriters, who were—in our data—among the heaviest users of AI.Automation versus augmentation. We also looked in more detail at  the tasks were being performed—specifically, at which tasks involved “automation” (where AI directly performs tasks such as formatting a document) versus “augmentation” (where AI collaborates with a user to perform a task).Overall, we saw a slight lean towards augmentation, with 57% of tasks being augmented and 43% of tasks being automated. That is, in just over half of cases, AI was not being used to replace people doing tasks, but instead worked  them, engaging in tasks like validation (e.g., double-checking the user’s work), learning (e.g., helping the user acquire new knowledge and skills), and task iteration (e.g., helping the user brainstorm or otherwise doing repeated, generative tasks).Our study provides a unique glimpse into how AI is changing the labor market. But as with all studies it has important limitations. Some of these include:We can’t know for certain whether someone using Claude for a task was completing a task for work. Someone asking Claude for writing or editing advice  be doing so at work, but they could also be doing so for the novel they’re writing as a hobby.Relatedly, we don’t know  the users were using the responses from Claude. Were they, for instance, copy-pasting code snippets? Were they fact-checking responses or accepting them uncritically? Some of what appears in our data to be automation could, in fact, be augmentation: for example, a user might ask Claude to write a full memo for them (which would appear as automation), but then edit it themselves afterwards (which would be augmentation).We also only analyze data from Claude.ai Free and Pro plans, rather than API, Team, or Enterprise users. While Claude.ai data contains some non-work conversations, we used a language model to filter this data to only contain conversations relevant to an occupational task, which helps to mitigate this concern.The sheer number of different tasks means it is possible that Clio classified some conversations incorrectly (please see the full paper, in particular Appendix B, for details on how we validated the analysis);Claude can’t generate images (except indirectly via code), and so some creative uses won’t be referenced in the data;Given that Claude is advertised for use as a state-of-the-art coding model, we might expect coding to be overrepresented as a use case. For that reason, we don’t argue that the uses in our dataset are a representative sample of AI use in general.Conclusions and future researchAI use is rapidly expanding, and models are becoming ever-more capable. The labor-market picture may look quite different within a relatively short time. For that reason, we’ll repeat many of the analyses above over time to help track the societal and economic changes that are likely to occur. We’ll regularly release the results and the associated datasets as part of the Anthropic Economic Index.These kinds of longitudinal analyses can give us new insights into AI and the job market. For example, we’ll be able to monitor changes in the depth of AI use within occupations. If it remains the case that AI is used only for certain tasks, and only a few jobs use AI for the vast majority of their tasks, the future might be one where most current jobs evolve rather than disappear. We can also monitor the ratio of automation to augmentation, providing signals of areas where automation is becoming more prevalent.Our research gives data on how AI is being used, but it doesn’t provide policy prescriptions. Answers to questions about how to prepare for AI’s impact on the labor market can’t come directly from research in isolation; instead, they’ll come from a combination of evidence, values, and experience from broad perspectives. We look forward to using our new methodology to shed more light on these issues.Read the full paper for more details of our analyses and results.Open data and call for inputThe most important contribution of this paper, and of the Anthropic Economic Index, is its new methodology providing detailed data on the impacts of AI. We’re immediately openly sharing the dataset we used for the above analyses, and we plan to share further such datasets as they become available in the future.The full dataset can be downloaded here.A form for researchers to provide feedback on our data and suggest new research directions is here.We appreciate the productive comments and discussion on early findings and drafts of the paper from Jonathon Hazell, Anders Humlum, Molly Kinder, Anton Korinek, Benjamin Krause, Michael Kremer, John List, Ethan Mollick, Lilach Mollick, Arjun Ramani, Will Rinehart, Robert Seamans, Michael Webb, and Chenzi Xu.If you’re interested in working at Anthropic to research the effects of AI on the labor market, we encourage you to apply for our Societal Impacts Research Scientist and Research Engineer roles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Useful Thing AI Has Done</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_fHJIYENdI</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/P_fHJIYENdI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 14:03:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The biggest problems in the world might be solved by tiny molecules unlocked using AI.

For example, "John
Peters" and "John Peterson" are someone whose father was named
"Peter".  ("Peters" should be understood as "Peter's".)  Similarly we
have John Williams and John Williamson, John Roberts and John
Robertson, John Richards and John Richardson, John James and John
Jameson, John Johns and John Johnson, and so on.Often Dad's name was a nickname.  For example, a common nickname for
"John" is "Jack" and we have (less commonly) John Jacks and (more
commonly) John Jackson. John Bills and John Bilson, John Wills and
John Wilson, and John Willis and John Willison are Bill, Will, and
Wille, all short for William."Richard" is "Dick", and we have John Dicks (or Dix) and John Dickson
(or Dixon).  "Nicholas" is "Nick" and we have John Nicks (or Nix) and John
Nickson (or Nixon).Sometimes the name has the diminutive suffix “-kin” inserted.  Wilkins
is little Will's son, as is Wilkinson; Peterkins is little Peter's
son.These patterns are so common that if you find surnames that follow
them you can almost always infer a forename, although it may be one
that is no longer common, or that is spelled differently.  For
example, many people are named Pierce, Pearse, Pierson, or Pearson,
which is from the name Pierre, Piers or Pierce, still used in English
although much less common than in the past.  (It is from the same root
as Peter.)  Perkins is little Pierre.  
Robin used to be a nickname for
Robert (it's “Robkin” with the difficult “-bk-” simplified to just
“-b-”) and we have John Robins and John Robinson. Sometimes, the pattern is there but the name is unclear because it is
a nickname that is now so uncommon that it is neatly forgotten.  The
fathers of John Watts, Watson, and Watkins were called Wat, which used
to be short for Walter.  John Hobbs, John Hobson, and Hobkins are
named for Hob, which was short for Robert in the same way that Rob and
Bob are still.  (I had a neighbor who was called Hob, and told me his
family claimed that it was short for Robert, but that he wasn't sure.
I assured him that they were correct.)  “Daw”, an archaic nickname for
“David”, gives us Dawes, Dawkins, and Dawson.Back in September when I started this article I thought on John Gibbs
and John Gibson.  Who's named "Gib", and why?  Is it archaic nickname?
Yes!  It was short for Gilbert.  Then I forgot about the draft article
until today when I woke up wondering about John Simpson (and, I
realize now, John Simms and John Simkins). And it transpired "Sim" or
"Simme" was once a common nickname for Simon.I would welcome further examples.Vicki Rosenzweig reminds me that another lost nickname for Richard is
"Hick" (like "Rick" and "Dick") and from this we get Hicks, Hix,
Hickson, Hixon, Hickman, and (she informs me) "Hickmott"."-mott" perhaps indicates a male in-law, according to the Dictionary
of American Family Names via
Ancestrry.com.
The only other clear example of this that I noticed was "Willmott".
Note that Gaelic names like Dermott are not of this type; the
resemblance is coincidental.We get Hodge / Hodges / Hodgson / Hodgkins from "Hodge", an arcahic
nickname for Roger.Lucy Keer suggests that Bateson / Bates is from "Bat", an archair
nickname for Bartholomew.Christopher Taylor reminds me that in Atkins and Atkinson the "At-" is
short for "Adam", and   similarly in "Addis" and "Addison".  I know a
guy named Atteson but I'm not sure it is the same thing.Response to this article has been too much for me to keep up with."Dob" is another old nickname for "Robert", giving us "Dobson";"Dodge" another nickname for Roger, hence Dodgson, as in Louis Carrol's real name, Charles Dodgson;"Tibb" is an old nickname for Theobald, giving surnames like "Tibbs" and "Tibbets";"Hud" for "Hugh", giving us the Hudsons.I also asked Claude for suggestions:I'm going to paste a blog article that discusses common English
  surnames that are patronymic versions of forenames that no longer
  exist.  For example, the common surname "Watson" is from "Wat", and
  "Wat" was once a common nickname for "Walter", but no longer used.
  I would like you to list ten similar examples that are not mentioned
  in the article.Here are ten examples of common English surnames derived from obsolete
  forenames or nicknames, different from those mentioned in the article:Higgins/Higgs - from "Hick," a medieval pet form of RichardTimms/Timson - from "Tim," originally a medieval nickname for TimothyHodgson/Hodges - from "Hodge," once a common nickname for RogerAtkins/Atkinson - from "At" or "Atte," medieval diminutive of AdamParkins/Parkinson - from "Perkin," diminutive of Peter/PierreJudson/Judd - from "Judd," medieval nickname for JordanMalkins/Malkinson - from "Malk," diminutive of MalcolmLarkins/Larkin - from "Larry" or "Laurence," medieval form of LawrenceCollins/Colson - from "Col," medieval nickname for NicholasHuggins/Huggett - from "Hug," medieval pet form of HughRemember that some of these might be made up.  For example,
Wiktionary claims that #7 is ,
from , a nickname for Mary.  Who's right?  I don't know.  The
only way to settle this is with a cage match!  I hope.I complained that #2 was not to spec because “Tim” is still common,
and demanded a replacement:Rankins/Rankin - from "Ran," a medieval diminutive of RandolphI also asked Claude if I had made any errors, and it said:The article claims that "Robin" comes from "Robkin" with "bk"
  simplified to "b". This is incorrect."Robin" is actually a French
  diminutive of Robert, coming from Old French Robin/Rovin. …]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: HTML visualization of a PDF file&apos;s internal structure</title><link>https://github.com/desgeeko/pdfsyntax/blob/main/docs/browse.md</link><author>desgeeko</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:52:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

        My Tesla Experience
    

    
      In October 2024 I decided to buy a Tesla Model 3. When I picked up the car, many of its features did not work (cameras, GPS navigation system, autopilot, software updates, etc.). It turned out to be a major issue with Tesla’s brand-new on-board computer. This is a common failure in Tesla Model 3 cars manufactured in the last quarter of 2024. The issue has affected thousands of Tesla customers. Two weeks later, the car began to . Several drivers experiencing the same failure have also reported problems with the braking (ABS) and suspension (EPS) systems.Tesla acknowledges all faults in the vehicle (except for battery losses, a fact on which it has not yet formally commented). The company refuses to accept a return of the vehicle without penalty, even though the problems were reported immediately. The only solution they offer is to make me wait 3 months for a miraculous replacement part. Ignored and without any type of compensation, I live attached to a car that needs a full recharge every 12 days to not die. For my own safety, and that of other drivers, I have stopped driving the vehicle.In this blog I tell you how it happened. If you are the owner of a Tesla car, or you are thinking about buying one, I encourage you to read my blog and see up close how  treats their own customers. It is possible that if you have problems with your car, you will end up living in hell.It’s been over 4 years since I stopped driving regularly.At the end of 2020, my partner and I moved to  (China). My old car, a , stayed in Spain. I had bought it second-hand in 2007, and it served me well for more than 10 years. I never had big problems. Upon returning from China, at the end of 2023, my wife and I went to live in , where she is from. That’s when I made the decision that in 2024 I would buy a new car.I’m not a motor enthusiast. I like to drive, and I have had the opportunity to take long car trips through Spain and other countries, but I know little about cars. Therefore, when purchasing a new vehicle, I decided to follow the advice of what experts call “the wisdom of the crowd”. Of the list of the 10 best-selling cars in Spain, the one that caught my attention the most was the . It is a car that I had already driven as a rental vehicle on several occasions. The decision was almost made, my next car would be a Toyota Corolla.It was during a family gathering in August when I decided to ask my cousins, much more educated than me in the world of motors, for advice. One of them had a Kia EV6. He was very satisfied with it, so the idea of buying an electric car began to float around in my head.I started reading blogs and online magazines about electric cars. I soon came to the conclusion that the  is, today, the best EV in terms of quality and price. It is the electric car with the lowest consumption (12.5 kW / 100 km), and it is also the best-selling EV in the world (again ). In addition, there is the incentive of the Tesla Charger Network. After reading an article on my friend Alberto Ruibal’s blog in which he argues why the Tesla Model 3 is cheaper than a Dacia Sandero (in Spanish), I ended up being completely convinced. My next car would be a Tesla Model 3.Buying a Tesla where there is no TeslaA Tesla car is always purchased through Tesla’s website. If you live in a country where Tesla is officially present, you would simply go to the website and buy your car from your country (for example, ). Unfortunately, Tesla is still not present in some countries in Europe. That is the case of countries such as Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania or , where I live. If Tesla is not present in your country of residence, you would go to Tesla’s website and buy your car at , which is physically located in  (Holland). In short, when you live in a European country where there is no Tesla you have to import your car from Holland (See ).Importing the car from Holland implies an additional investment of time and money. More time, because you will have to complete more bureaucratic procedures to register the car in your country of residence. More money, because you will need to hire a transport company to bring your car from Holland. It is not possible to travel to Holland, get to Tilburg, and drive the car from there.Another problem with importing the car is that, in case there is some type of subsidy for the acquisition of EVs in your country of residence, it is likely you will not be able to use it if the vehicle is imported.I estimate that the total import costs were slightly over 2000 EUR.: In some Internet online boards I read that it is possible to buy the car in any other country in Europe, but normally users who choose this option usually have problems with VAT refunds.Transporting a car from HollandI made my reservation on . Three weeks later, specifically on , the car was already available for pickup. I then contacted a vehicle transport company, Tradisa, to organize the delivery.Incidentally, just when the car was arriving, I was in Spain. Therefore, Tradisa suggested me to contact DriveTesla.sk. This is a company in Slovakia that is dedicated to importing Tesla cars. They offer services such as vehicle purchase, registration, insurance, etc. I contracted several services with them: insurance, car registration and deposit service (in addition to winter tires). On , Tradisa dropped the car off at DriveTesla facilities and three weeks later, once I was back in Slovakia, I went to Bratislava to pick up the car. It was . After almost 2 months since the reservation, the car was finally in my hands!But not everything was going to be good news. One of DriveTesla’s staff members warned me: “By the way, the cameras are not working. Probably it can be fixed by updating the Operating System.” I didn’t know it at the time, but my nightmare was about to begin…Making the jump from a  to a  is not trivial. I’d driven automatic cars before, but at least they had a physical gear-shifter! :) For 45 minutes, one of the DriveTesla staff members taught me the gist of how the car worked. We also took the opportunity to try to update the Operating System and solve the , but the download got stuck halfway through. It seems like I wasn’t going to be able to fix the cameras, but did I really need them? “My old Clio didn’t have cameras, I’m not going to miss them”, I thought.I was expecting a long trip, so before hitting the road I decided to take a few laps to practice. I practiced until I felt comfortable. Before leaving, I looked up my destination on the car’s . Bad luck, the GPS didn’t work either. “What difference does it make? My old Clio didn’t have a GPS navigator either. I’m not going to miss it”, I thought again. I pulled my phone out of my pocket, looked for my destination on Google Maps (a small town in the middle of Slovakia where I would meet my wife), and this time, I hit the road.On the way it started to rain. I remembered what I was told me during the instruction: “the Tesla Model 3 has a windshield wiper that comes into operation automatically when it starts raining”. It was raining and raining, but the automatic windshield wipers didn’t kick in. On the steering wheel hub, there is also a physical button to activate the wipers manually. I had no choice but to start pressing that button, and continue doing it often because unfortunately it wasn’t raining, it was pouring. From the Tesla’s main screen, it’s possible to set the windshield wiper speed. However, I prefer to not take my eyes off the road when I drive. After a long time of almost continuously pressing the button, I discovered that the speed can also be set by pressing the button twice in a row very quickly.After an hour and a half of driving, I stopped the car to rest and stretch my legs. That’s when I understood what was happening. Since the cameras were not working, the automatic windshield wipers did not work either. Paying more attention to the information screen, I realized of several notifications warning that other functionalities in the car were not available. For example, ,  or . That is to say, everything that depended on the car’s cameras didn’t work, including  obviously (but luckily it didn’t occur to me to try it lol). Another thing that didn’t work was . I mean, I managed to pair Spotify from my phone to the Tesla, but when I started playing music, the song stopped after 10 seconds. This always happened, regardless of which song.Even so, I still had hope inside of me all this could be solved by updating the Operating System. Because we already know that hope is the last thing ever lost and we human beings are forever optimists.On Sunday , when I got home, I tried to update the Operating System again. No luck. Same problem again, the download hung halfway.The next day, I gave it another try with the same result. So on Tuesday, , I gave up completely and opened a ticket, through the Tesla app, at the  (my closest Tesla Service Center). I described all the technical problems I had observed in the car so far:The  are not working.The  is not working.Nothing that depends on the cameras works: , automatic windshield wipers, , , , etc. are not workingAfter four days without receiving a response from the , I texted them again. On the sixth day, terribly worried, I called . After a long wait, I managed to speak to an agent. As I was describing the problem, he already knew what the issue was about. This article, authored by  for , explains the problem in the car: Tesla is having major issue with its self-driving computer inside new cars. The article describes a fault present in many of the Tesla Model 3 manufactured in the last quarter of 2024. A short circuit when calibrating the cameras leaves the new on-board computer, known as HW4, unusable.“The problem is linked to a new version of Tesla’s HW4 (sometimes called AI4) onboard self-driving computer. Internally, some refer to the new version as AI4.1. The computers are short-circuiting.”“Tesla drivers are reporting computer failures after driving off with their brand-new cars over just the first few tens to hundreds of miles. Wide-ranging features powered by the computer, like active safety features, cameras, and even GPS, navigation, and range estimations, fail to work.”These are exactly the problems that I had observed in the vehicle, along with other additional dysfunctions such as the inability to update the Operating System and the data transfer problems in Spotify.The article also explains that Tesla does not have replacement stock for the new on-board computer, and is making its customers believe that the car is drivable in this state and poses no risk:“One source said that Tesla service is being told to play down any safety concerns related to this problem to avoid people believing their brand-new cars are not drivable. It’s unclear if Tesla reported the issue to NHTSA despite the fact that the broken rear-view camera goes against federal safety regulations, which should force a recall.”“Tesla service is currently being overwhelmed by the issue, and Tesla is pushing service appointments to next year.”On , I received a response from the Budapest Service Center confirming the problems in the vehicle and that the on-board computer had to be replaced. As the article points out, they informed me that at the moment they did not have the part in stock and they did not know when it would be available.Exactly one week later, I received a message in Hungarian from the Budapest Service Center letting me choose a date for my appointment. The earliest date, .Almost 3 months of waiting to, hypothetically, repair the vehicle. Apparently, Tesla considers OK their customers to drive vehicles with the following features not working:: essential for parking, surveillance, etc.: a crucial feature in the Tesla Model 3, as when planning a route, the car indicates where to stop for charging. Additionally, when approaching a charging point, the vehicle automatically preheats the battery for a faster recharge.Braking (ABS) and suspension (EPS) systems: I have no way of knowing whether these systems are working correctly in my vehicle or not, as I never had the chance to drive the car in perfect condition. Regardless, I don’t believe I have to risk my own safety, or that of others, to find out whether these systems are working reliably. and  (e.g., from Spotify).Other systems that rely on cameras: Autopilot, automatic windshield wipers, automatic lights, lane departure detection, drowsiness detection, etc.Renault Clio vs Tesla Model 3The Electrotek article cited above was published on . Until I read it, I wasn’t fully aware of the impact of the breakdown. Especially, the part that affects the  (ABS) and  (EPS) systems. In fact, I kept driving the car and joked with my friends that I had an . That is, on the outside the car looked like a Tesla Model 3, but on the inside it worked like my old . Let’s compare:Automatic windshield wiperSurveillance (Sentry mode)In fact, a 20-year-old Clio DCI is slightly superior to this . It is true that the Clio does not have heated seats and steering wheel, but that does not justify the price difference I think.The comparison may seem humorous, but it reveals something obvious: a Tesla Model 3 is superior to other cars for these and other features. These functionalities are not extras in the vehicle, they are an integral part of it, and have a cost for which customers pay. Some of these features are essential in a Tesla Model 3, such as  or the . Why should I take risks, whether or not I’m going to hit the car, when parking it? Planning a long-distance trip is much more difficult without GPS navigation since I have to schedule the stops myself to recharge the car and I cannot preheat the battery. When I charge on a Tesla charger, I do not know the cost since this information is only available in the GPS navigator, etc. I have left out of the picture the problems, reported by other users, in the braking (ABS) and suspension (EPS) systems, but without a doubt, they pose a risk to the safety of drivers.But this story doesn’t end here. The worst was yet to come…Doctor, my car is losing battery. Is it serious?It is expected for an EV to lose battery while it remains parked. There’s even a technical term for this. It is called  or .The  is the discharge that occurs in an electric car while we are not using it. It is something similar to what happens with mobile phones. Even if we are not using a cell phone, it loses battery unless it remains plugged in. The same thing happens in an EV. I don’t know what the average expected battery loss value is for a Tesla Model 3. During the 3 weeks the car was parked in Bratislava, the battery went from 83% to 79%. That is, 4% loss in 3 weeks. I think it’s a pretty reasonable number.In addition to , EV owners need to be more aware about the care and maintenance of their vehicle’s battery. For example, the usual thing is to charge the car up to 80-85%, and . If the car falls below 20%, it is recommended to recharge it immediately. Electric car batteries, unlike laptop batteries, do not have a memory effect. Therefore, the battery is not damaged if the car is charged from 20% to 50%, for example. On the other hand, Tesla recommends charging the battery up to 100% at least once a week.I don’t know whether it was a coincidence or not, but just when I charged the car for the first time to 100%, the battery started to drain. I charged the battery to 100% and just , without having used the car, . That means, the car had lost 4% battery daily. Just that day, my wife and I had planned a long trip to the .While driving, my wife was searching the Internet for information about what could have caused this sudden battery loss. «Could it have been the cold?» The car sleeps in a garage, and although it was winter the temperature never dropped below 0 degrees. It is true that extreme temperatures (very high or very low) can affect the battery, but Norway has the highest number of EVs in the world per person. Common sense tells me that it must be colder in Norway than in Slovakia. Therefore, it couldn’t be the cold. Another possibility could be some feature that had been left activated. It is known that the  of the Tesla Model 3 consumes 1% every 2.5 hours. That means, if you inadvertently leave  activated, the car can lose almost 10% of battery in a day. But  was not activated.Either way, this unexpected setback was a huge inconvenience to our trip. Arriving at our first stop, we had to spend all of our time finding a Tesla charger before resuming our journey. Fortunately, one recharge was enough to get me back home without having to stop again.As soon as I returned, I went to charge the car. This time I decided to charge it up to 82-83%. This happened on Saturday .The next day, I was flying from Budapest (Hungary) to Porto (Portugal). It was a bumpy flight, and I ended up arriving in Porto on Monday morning. Upon arrival, I opened the Tesla app to see if the car was still losing battery at 4%. My surprise was huge when I checked the . That is to say, the car was losing battery at a greater pace than expected, around !! A chill ran through my entire body.I was going to spend approximately a week in Spain. On  I would take a plane from Vigo to London to spend New Year’s Eve there with my wife and some friends. Until  I would not be back in Slovakia. I did a quick calculation. With a battery loss of 8% per day the battery would end up being consumed between  and . Once I had made this calculation, the first thing that crossed my mind was to  and  to Slovakia . It was an absolutely irrational thought. I was putting my life, well-being and relationships with family and friends before the needs of a car. I had bought a car so I could move around more freely. But now the car was conditioning me. My life and my plans revolved around an object. I didn’t have a car, I had a . I had to take care of it, I had to see if it had slept well, and above all, I had to check if it still had battery left.Going back to my senses, I looked for a . I called my wife, who was still in Slovakia, and told her the bad news. The idea was to somehow charge the car enough so that it wouldn’t die before returning. I knew it wasn’t going to be easy for her because she hadn’t driven in years. In addition, she didn’t have much time since she was taking a flight to London that same day. Even so, with the help of a friend, she managed to charge the car up to 98% before leaving.I spent Christmas  and trying to figure out why the car had started losing 8% battery daily. I remember that on Christmas Eve I managed to speak with Tesla Spain. When I asked whether it was normal for the car to lose 8% of battery daily, the agent on the other end of the line answered: . I was stunned. Now I really didn’t understand anything. “Was it within expectations that the car would lose 8% battery per day? But, who could live with a car like that?”, I thought. In my phone call with Tesla Spain, I insisted that they speak to the  so that they could get back me. I had notified them immediately when I saw the car was losing battery, but I still had not received a response. I also sent an email to  (my only contact when purchasing the vehicle), demanding either a replacement of the vehicle or a full refund of the amount, since the car was defective from the very first day I laid my hands on it and now there was this huge battery problem. I also tried to contact the , without success.The days I went through were not pleasant at all. My head was constantly spinning around the car. Every day since , I started sending a screenshot to the  showing how the car was losing 8% battery per day. I asked them directly, repeatedly, what was causing this problem. But I never received a response. They had deliberately decided to ignore me. To this day, and as I write these lines, I am still waiting for the Budapest Service Center to explain to me what the battery losses are due to. I continue sending screenshots daily.When I returned to Slovakia, the first thing I did was to charge the car. Then, I called Tesla again. On the other end of the line, an agent told me the battery losses were due to previous problems already existing in the car. I insisted that the  confirmed this diagnosis, but as I have explained previously . I asked for solutions or mitigations to this situation. The only solution they gave me was to keep waiting for that miraculous replacement part. There are no contingency plans, no replacement vehicles, no compensation for these problems.The lack of management and planning at Tesla left me greatly disappointed and in disbelief. A car that is known to be defective should be evaluated at a mechanic immediately. Making a customer to wait 3 months for a proper diagnosis or replacement part is unacceptable. Forcing thousands of customers to drive a dysfunctional car, which depends so much on technology, is not only unacceptable but also . It poses a serious risk to your safety, that of your companions, passers-by and other drivers. Forcing someone to live with a car that loses 8% battery a day is like forcing someone to live tied to a chain. Even charging the car to 100%, the battery does not last more than 12 days. I can’t go on vacation for 2 weeks because otherwise this car would die.During my conversation with the Tesla agent, I asked whether the  could handle my case more quickly. The agent told me that he could not check the waiting times of the centers, and suggested me not to switch Service Centers as I would lose my turn. All Tesla’s customers have their hands tied, even though they do not know it yet. I have absolutely lost my trust in this company, and the worst of all is that I feel like a prisoner of it.I came to the conclusion that, even if Tesla were able to fix the problems in my car, I would not like to live within their . I don’t want to plan my life around the ineptitude and inefficiency of a company, which also  and in a banal way . On  I called Tesla Netherlands Sales Department to request the return of the vehicle and a refund of my money. Nobody picked up the phone on the other end of the line. Finally, after several calls, I managed to talk to an agent from another department. I requested a refund of my money since the vehicle was delivered broken and now the battery problems were added. The agent was not sure whether I was entitled to a full refund since the car had more than 100 km. He was also not sure whether I could leave the car in Budapest or should I transport it back to Tilburg. He promised me that on Monday, , someone from the Sales Department would contact me. We agreed on a time, between 4 and 6 PM. After almost a month, I’m still waiting for that call.All of this can be summarized in a single sentence: The Head of the Department of Government Efficiency is the CEO of an disfunctional company.Since the battery problems occurred I have stopped driving the vehicle. Even more so, after reading the article by Daniel Murias for Motorpasión (in Spanish). I consider it a risk to drive the car in this state. And I don’t think I should risk my life, or the lives of other people, to find out whether the car’s braking or suspension systems are working properly. This should be done by a mechanic, either at a garage or a Tesla Service Center. But this is Tesla, and it seems like no one is behind the wheel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Infinite horizontal arrays of text editors</title><link>https://zeminary.com/arrays/app.html</link><author>tsydenzhap</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:25:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iwo Jima: WWII in the Pacific</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/iwo-jima-wwii-in-the-pacific</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67a5ffad9c6f7f7f28ca817f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmWKIvY0PzYQ9laffKEQzYQFNIzxWzY8Lxz6KuHWGpU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[80 years ago, on the rocky volcanic island of Iwo Jima, the vicious battle for the Pacific reached ever bloodier crescendos.

But now long-time Slashdot reader theodp brings some news about the course's fate over at Yale. From Yale's student newspaper:


After a decade of partnership with Harvard, Yale's CS50 course will no longer be offered starting in fall 2025.... One of Yale's largest computer science courses, jointly taught with Harvard University, was canceled during a monthly faculty meeting after facing budgetary challenges. [Yale's endowment is $40+ billion]... Since Yale started offering the course in 2015, CS50 has consistently seen enrollment numbers in the hundreds and was often the department's largest class.... According to [Yale instructor Ozan] Erat, the original [anonymous] donation that made CS50 possible ended in June 2024, and the cost of employing so many undergraduate learning assistants for the course had become unsustainable. 

theodp reminds us that CS50 and its progeny "will continue to live on in all their glory in-person and online at Harvard and edX."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why blog if nobody reads it?</title><link>https://andysblog.uk/why-blog-if-nobody-reads-it/</link><author>alexgiann</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 17:50:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Back in the day, advertising legend Bill Bernbach said, “The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.”Let’s tell the truth, then: Nobody reads your blog.At least, not as many as you’d like. Maybe a handful, maybe none. You pour your thoughts into it, craft each sentence, pick the right image — then silence. No likes, no shares, no engagement.There’s two lies we tell ourselves:If I write it, they will come. They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.There is a hidden value in blogging.
There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.So, who’s there real audience?You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:Future you.

Only eight people remain in the core team around Rust for Linux... Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. 
The reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: 

- "2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers..." — Daniel Almedia 

- "I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time." — Andrea Righi

 - "[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs." — Carlos Bilbao 

- "I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete..." Steven Rostedt 

Rostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. "I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language." 

But still "contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps," argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:

"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain." 

But the article also notes that Google "has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones."
The use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. "Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones," Ojeda told me after his talk. 

In addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as "maintainers become more comfortable with it," Ojeda told me. "Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now," Ojeda said. "If they could drop C, they would do it...." 

Amid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Non-committal love - Are situationships good for us? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgnmmpKleq8</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bgnmmpKleq8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The desire for non-committal love is a dating trend among singles aged 18 to 25.

Some Christian theologians claim that aspects of Christology can articulate with fundamental understandings of science. Most scientists would be baffled by the claim.

But he complains that many developers "use C++ as if it was still the previous millennium," in an article titled 21st Century C++ that promises "the key concepts on which performant, type safe, and flexible C++ software can be built: resource management, life-time management, error-handling, modularity, and generic programming... 

"At the end, I present ways to ensure that code is contemporary, rather than relying on outdated, unsafe, and hard-to-maintain techniques: guidelines and profiles."

To help developers focus on effective use of contemporary C++ and avoid outdated "dark corners" of the language, sets of guidelines have been developed. Here I focus on the C++ Core guidelines that I consider the most ambitious... My principal aim is a type-safe and resource-safe use of ISO standard C++. That is: 

- Every object is exclusively used according to its definition
- No resource is leaked 
This encompasses what people refer to as memory safety and much more. It is not a new goal for C++. Obviously, it cannot be achieved for every use of C++, but by now we have years of experience showing that it can be done for modern code, though so far enforcement has been incomplete... When thinking about C++, it is important to remember that C++ is not just a language but part of an ecosystem consisting of implementations, libraries, tools, teaching, and more. 
WG21 (and others) are working on "profiles" to enforce guidelines (though they're "not yet available, except for experimental and partial versions"). But Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines "use a strategy known as subset-of-superset."

 First: extend the language with a few library abstractions: use parts of the standard library and add a tiny library to make use of the guidelines convenient and efficient (the Guidelines Support Library, GSL).
 Next: subset: ban the use of low-level, inefficient, and error-prone features. 
What we get is "C++ on steroids": Something simple, safe, flexible, and fast; rather than an impoverished subset or something relying on massive run-time checking. Nor do we create a language with novel and/or incompatible features. The result is 100% ISO standard C++. Messy, dangerous, low-level features can still be enabled and used when needed. 
Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines focus on rules "we hope that everyone eventually could benefit from."

No uninitialized variables
No range or nullptr violations
No resource leaks
No dangling pointers
No type violations
No invalidation

Last weekend Donald Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 per cent levy on imports from China. Canadian oil was hit at a lower rate of 10 per cent. The duties will take effect from Tuesday. Just days later these tariffs were suspended.

Trump said the actions were in response to the “major threat” posed by the flow of migrants and drugs into the US across its borders with Canada and Mexico.

Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn & Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.

We dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?

What happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?

We also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore.

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

The documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
In doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.
The documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished.

The stadium’s latest $560M renovation–from the concession stands to the seating bowl–helped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency. WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome’s plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.

ABSTRACT
There’s no such thing as the perfect programming language. I’m sorry, but there isn’t, and I’ll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We’re going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what’s already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

As today’s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.Since President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk’s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the , the Office of Personnel Management, the , and the Department of Health and Human Resources, among others. first reported on Feb. 2 that one of the technologists on Musk’s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named , who reportedly goes by the nickname “Big Balls” online. One of the companies Coristine founded, , was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.“Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,”  reported. “One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.”Mr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In a follow-up story this week,  found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.A profile photo from Coristine’s WhatsApp account.Internet routing records show that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called  (AS400495). Also known as “,” Packetware currently hosts tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname “” on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as “Edward.”From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage’s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel “,” a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.Coristine’s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called , which  generously described as a “network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.”  wrote:“At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees , also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.”The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was , a Georgia man who pleaded guilty in 2020 to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor pleaded guilty in 2017 to charges including an attack on our home in 2013. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as “swatting.”CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers set up the Web site exposed[dot]su, which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed. noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn’t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website pathtruths.com includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine’s firing.According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine’s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path’s technicians was a Canadian man named  who was convicted in 2017 of perpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats — including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.A snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine’s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.On May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.“I don’t think there’s a lot of money to be made in the com,” Rivage lamented. “I’m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.”Rivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that.  reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at , Elon Musk’s brain implant startup.The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.That’s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That’s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community periodically spill over into real-world violence.When Coristine’s name surfaced in ‘s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage’s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man

2025-02-05 16:35:19 UTC chainofcommand#0 i dont think they’ll care tbhGiven the speed with which Musk’s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he’d recently been dismissed from a job for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders.According to the national security adjudication guidelines (PDF) released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.The DNI policy further states that “eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.”On Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member  resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after asked the White House about his connection to the account.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.Elez’s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and , the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.Earlier today, Musk said he planned to rehire Elez after  and  reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn’t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was “very proud of the job that this group of young people” are doing.A White House official told on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in “full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.”reports Trump added that his administration’s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, “where he suggested without evidence that there could be ‘trillions’ of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.”GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk’s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE’s activities. ABC News says a federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk’s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.At least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans’ sensitive personal information, reports.Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk’s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.writes that The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an “immediate stop” to DOGE’s “unlawfully” digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew’s biggest fear in the field</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZKPlQkODY</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/o4ZKPlQkODY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VSCode’s SSH agent is bananas</title><link>https://fly.io/blog/vscode-ssh-wtf/</link><author>zdyxry</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:25:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re interested in getting integrated into the flow VSCode uses to do remote editing over SSH, because everybody is using VSCode now, and, in particular, they’re using forks of VSCode that generate code with LLMs. ”hallucination” is what we call it when LLMs get code wrong; “engineering” is what we call it when people do.LLM-generated code is useful in the general case if you know what you’re doing. But it’s ultra-useful if you can close the loop between the LLM and the execution environment (with an “Agent” setup). There’s lots to say about this, but for the moment: it’s a semi-effective antidote to hallucination: the LLM generates the code, the agent scaffolding runs the code, the code generates errors, the agent feeds it back to the LLM, the process iterates. So, obviously, the issue here is you don’t want this iterative development process happening on your development laptop, because LLMs have boundary issues, and they’ll iterate on your system configuration just as happily on the Git project you happen to be working in. A thing you’d really like to be able to do: run a closed-loop agent-y (“agentic”? is that what we say now) configuration for an LLM, on a clean-slate Linux instance that spins up instantly and that can’t screw you over in any way. You get where we’re going with this.Anyways! I would like to register a concern.Emacs hosts the spiritual forebearer of remote editing systems, a blob of hyper-useful Elisp called “Tramp”. If you can hook Tramp up to any kind of interactive environment — usually, an SSH session — where it can run Bourne shell commands, it can extend Emacs to that environment.So, VSCode has a feature like Tramp. Which, neat, right? You’d think, take Tramp, maybe simplify it a bit, switch out Elisp for Typescript.Unlike Tramp, which lives off the land on the remote connection, VSCode mounts a full-scale invasion: it runs a Bash snippet stager that downloads an agent, including a binary installation of Node. The agent runs over port-forwarded SSH. It establishes a WebSockets connection back to your running VSCode front-end. The underlying protocol on that connection can:Wander around the filesystem
Launch its own shell PTY processes
In security-world, there’s a name for tools that work this way. I won’t say it out loud, because that’s not fair to VSCode, but let’s just say the name is murid in nature.I would be a little nervous about letting people VSCode-remote-edit stuff on dev servers, and apoplectic if that happened during an incident on something in production. It turns out we don’t have to care about any of this to get a custom connection to a Fly Machine working in VSCode, so none of this matters in any kind of deep way, but: we’ve decided to just be a blog again, so: we had to learn this, and now you do too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s 7-Year Slog To Improve Chrome Extensions Still Hasn&apos;t Satisfied Developers</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/2246202/googles-7-year-slog-to-improve-chrome-extensions-still-hasnt-satisfied-developers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Register's Thomas Claburn reports: Google's overhaul of Chrome's extension architecture continues to pose problems for developers of ad blockers, content filters, and privacy tools. [...] While Google's desire to improve the security, privacy, and performance of the Chrome extension platform is reasonable, its approach -- which focuses on code and permissions more than human oversight -- remains a work-in-progress that has left extension developers frustrated.
 
Alexei Miagkov, senior staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who oversees the organization's Privacy Badger extension, told The Register, "Making extensions under MV3 is much harder than making extensions under MV2. That's just a fact. They made things harder to build and more confusing." Miagkov said with Privacy Badger the problem has been the slowness with which Google addresses gaps in the MV3 platform. "It feels like MV3 is here and the web extensions team at Google is in no rush to fix the frayed ends, to fix what's missing or what's broken still." According to Google's documentation, "There are currently no open issues considered a critical platform gap," and various issues have been addressed through the addition of new API capabilities.
 
Miagkov described an unresolved problem that means Privacy Badger is unable to strip Google tracking redirects on Google sites. "We can't do it the correct way because when Google engineers design the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest API], they fail to think of this scenario," he said. "We can do a redirect to get rid of the tracking, but it ends up being a broken redirect for a lot of URLs. Basically, if the URL has any kind of query string parameters -- the question mark and anything beyond that -- we will break the link." Miagkov said a Chrome developer relations engineer had helped identify a workaround, but it's not great. Miagkov thinks these problems are of Google's own making -- the company changed the rules and has been slow to write the new ones. "It was completely predictable because they moved the ability to fix things from extensions to themselves," he said. "And now they need to fix things and they're not doing it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The state of homelab tech (2025) (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/79</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/79/changelog--friends-79.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Techno Tim joins Adam to catch up on the state of Homelab for 2025, the state of AI at home and on-prem (AI Homelab) and where that’s heading, building a creator PC, choosing the parts for your build, GPU availability, Windows being user hostile, and why Tim is happy to be using Windows, Mac AND Linux.Changelog++ members save 8 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

Toil can never be totally eliminated.Very often, the biggest toil center for a team at a growing company will be its procedure for modifying infrastructure or its procedure for provisioning user accounts. Partial instructions for the latter might look like this:Create an SSH key pair for the user.Commit the public key to Git and push to master.Wait for the build job to finish.Find the user’s email address in the employee directory.Send the user their private key via 1Password.This is a relatively short example. Sometimes there are 20 steps in the process. Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Over time, these procedures can become unmanageably large and complex.Procedures like this are frustrating because they’re focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn’t rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions – just another checkbox checked. I have a word for a procedure like this: a .We know that this procedure is ripe for automation. We can easily see how to automate any given step. And we know that a computer could carry out the instructions with far greater speed and accuracy than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift.However, automating slogs sometimes feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Sure, we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5. But that wouldn’t  make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you’d still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.This perception of futility is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. I’ve found an approach that works pretty reliably: .Almost any slog can be turned into a . A do-nothing script is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For the example procedure above, we could write the following do-nothing script:import sys

def wait_for_enter():
    raw_input("Press Enter to continue: ")

class CreateSSHKeypairStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Run:")
        print("   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/{0}".format(context["username"]))
        wait_for_enter()

class GitCommitStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Copy ~/new_key.pub into the `user_keys` Git repository, then run:")
        print("    git commit {0}".format(context["username"]))
        print("    git push")
        wait_for_enter()

class WaitForBuildStep(object):
    build_url = "http://example.com/builds/user_keys"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Wait for the build job at {0} to finish".format(self.build_url))
        wait_for_enter()

class RetrieveUserEmailStep(object):
    dir_url = "http://example.com/directory"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to {0}".format(self.dir_url))
        print("Find the email address for user `{0}`".format(context["username"]))
        context["email"] = raw_input("Paste the email address and press enter: ")

class SendPrivateKeyStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to 1Password")
        print("Paste the contents of ~/new_key into a new document")
        print("Share the document with {0}".format(context["email"]))
        wait_for_enter()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = {"username": sys.argv[1]}
    procedure = [
        CreateSSHKeypairStep(),
        GitCommitStep(),
        WaitForBuildStep(),
        RetrieveUserEmailStep(),
        SendPrivateKeyStep(),
    ]
    for step in procedure:
        step.run(context)
    print("Done.")
This script doesn’t actually  any of the steps of the procedure. That’s why it’s called a do-nothing script. It feeds the user a step at a time and waits for them to complete each step manually.At first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides value. Maybe it looks like all we’ve done is make the instructions harder to read. But the value of a do-nothing script is immense:It’s now much less likely that you’ll lose your place and skip a step. This makes it easier to maintain focus and power through the slog.Each step of the procedure is now encapsulated in a function, which makes it possible to replace the text in any given step with code that performs the action automatically.Over time, you’ll develop a library of useful steps, which will make future automation tasks more efficient.A do-nothing script doesn’t save your team any manual effort. It lowers the activation energy for automating tasks, which allows the team to eliminate toil over time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New IEEE Standard for Securing Biomedical Devices and Data</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-standard-biomedical-devices-data</link><author>Kathy Pretz</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjI2ODI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDQzMjI5NX0._48EBGJrJMAj3jbHZn_JZFlc4gg3q5Kfk6SYQwDK1xY/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It covers electronic health records, devices, and hospital systems]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: A website that heatmaps your city based on your housing preferences</title><link>https://theretowhere.com/</link><author>WiggleGuy</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 18:23:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Abandoned Ancestor of José Andrés Became a Baker! | Finding Your Roots | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBqXOEoFzLE</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fBqXOEoFzLE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3TA8505 | #FindingYourRoots
José Andrés discovers that his great-great-grandmother, Oracia, was abandoned as a child and left to nuns. Most abandoned children at that time did not fare well, but Oracia beat the odds, being adopted by a mystery couple who set her up with financial stability. She would later marry, start a family -- and open a bakery -- an ambition that chef José shares!

Twice named one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” and awarded “Outstanding Chef” and “Humanitarian of the Year” by the James Beard Foundation, José Andrés is an internationally recognized humanitarian, culinary innovator, New York Times bestselling author, educator, Emmy-winning television personality, and owner of the award-winning José Andrés Group, which operates nearly 40 restaurants in the US and beyond. In 2010, Andrés founded World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit organization that is first to the frontlines of crises. Andrés’ many distinctions included the 2015 National Humanities Medal, the 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals, and the Princess of Asturias Foundation’s 2021 Concordia Prize for his humanitarian work. In 2023, Andrés founded the Global Food Institute at George Washington University in Washington DC.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

Robustness, Detectability, and Data Privacy in AI // MLOps Podcast #289 with Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.

// Abstract
Recent rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made it widely applicable across various domains, from autonomous systems to multimodal content generation. However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today’s AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known.

Between 1947 and 1967, black-owned homes in Birmingham, Alabama were bombed over 50 times. Homes on Center Street were targeted so often, the neighborhood became known as ‘Dynamite Hill.’ What happened on Center Street is a scar on American history, but the voices of Dynamite Hill speak with strength and grace about how they faced unimaginable hatred, with one repeated refrain: “I’m still here.”

Predestination is ultimate destiny, fate. It is the claim by some religions that a Supreme Being, whether a personal God or a cosmic force, has determined for individual lives their ultimate course. When God foreordains, whether for salvation or for damnation, nothing can resist. Is this fair? Does this make sense? Would you like such a God?

The conflict centers on a proposed patch enabling Rust-written device drivers to access the kernel's DMA API, which Hellwig strongly opposed. While the dispute isn't about Rust itself, Hellwig argues that maintaining cross-language codebases severely compromises Linux's integrated nature. From a report: "Don't force me to deal with your shiny language of the day," he [Hellwig] wrote. "Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain I have no interest in dealing with. If you want to use something that's not C, be that assembly or Rust, you write to C interfaces and deal with the impedance mismatch yourself as far as I'm concerned." This resistance follows the September departure of Microsoft engineer Wedson Almeida Filho from the Rust for Linux project, citing "nontechnical nonsense."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google finally shipped some fire…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xbh9LUYn0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k9xbh9LUYn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:26:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deploy your app without complexity using Sevalla http://bit.ly/4hDju8W

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein’s works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.

But a Bloomberg investigation reveals that several private hospital companies funded by the IFC have kept patients in their care until they can cover their bills or otherwise satisfy the hospital they will be able to pay. This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it’s just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

In a  leaderboard, updates happen almost instantly:A player’s score changes (e.g., after scoring a point or defeating an opponent).The system updates that player’s rank immediately.Other players can see the updated position without waiting or refreshing.This real-time aspect makes the user experience more dynamic and engaging. However, it also introduces significant , such as:Efficiently retrieving Top-N players (e.g., Top 10 or Top 100).Allowing players to quickly find their own rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.In this article, we will explore how to design a , , and  that can support above queries and enhance the user experience.Before diving into the design, lets clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of our real-time gaming leaderboard..: Display top N players (e.g., top 10, top 100) on the leaderboard and update it in real-time.: Allow a player to query their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard. Provide the ability to retrieve a “slice” of the leaderboard around a specific player (e.g., ranks 45 to 55 if the player is rank 50). Players can view past game scores and historical leaderboards for previous matches.Non-Functional Requirements Score changes should reflect immediately in the leaderboard.: Leaderboard queries should return the results in milliseconds.: System should support thousands of concurrent players submitting scores and fetching rankings.Approach to Designing the SystemThe most challenging aspects of building a real-time leaderboard is . Choosing the right storage system is critical to ensuring that queries can be executed efficiently without performance bottlenecks.To simplify the design process, we will follow below approach:Clearly define the input/output structure of leaderboard queries and updates.Define the High-Level Architecture: Identify core system components and their interactions.Choose the appropriate storage model optimized for fast leaderboard lookups and real-time updates.To support real-time leaderboard operations, we define a set of  that allow players to update scores, retrieve rankings, and query nearby ranks efficiently.Updates a player's score incrementally: POST /leaderboard/score/update{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "scoreDelta": 50
}We will use relative score updates () rather than absolute updates.{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "updatedScore": 1000,
  "currentRank": 10
}Retrieves the top-N players from the leaderboard, ranked by their scores.: GET /leaderboard/top?n=10:  = number of top players to fetch (default 10, max 100, etc.){

The Rwandan government mobilized the country’s Hutu population to attack members of the Tutsi minority and anyone who opposed. In just 100 days, around one million people were killed. 
 
30 years after the genocide, Rwandans are trying to move forward. In "reconciliation villages", convicted perpetrators, who have been released from prison, survivors of the genocide and their children live side by side and try to deal with the past.

WSJ’s Jonathan Cheng traveled to the world’s largest wholesale market called the Yiwu International Trade Market to see how these products are making their way into U.S. markets. If you’ve ever bought anything on Temu or Shein, there’s a good chance it came from this bazaar near China’s east coast, which is close to huge ports in Shanghai and Ningbo. 

WSJ explores why this market in China, the center point of global wholesale trade, has found itself in the U.S. government’s crosshairs.

The move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name. Deno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community. This legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term "JavaScript" in a conference title or business venture.
 
"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations," the website explains. "These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around -- for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world's most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name." [...] In the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of "JavaScript." The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.
 
Oracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term "in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer's guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term." The fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product. "Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner's Chief Executive Officer," the trademark cancellation petition says. "Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle."
 
Oracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO -- a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend. "Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material," Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented. Beyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Sports Teams Can Learn from Tiktok Star Josh Richards | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkTJUzRod0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uDkTJUzRod0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 23:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with entrepreneur Josh Richards to discuss his social media empire.

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.

For a very long time, it was the sensible default option. Around 2016, I used the Ubuntu GNOME flavor, and after they ditched the Unity desktop environment, GNOME became the default option. 

I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs. Estonian ID card software was also officially supported on Ubuntu, which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members. 

But then something changed. Ounapuu recounts how Ubuntu's bi-annual long-term support releases consistently broke functionality, from minor interface glitches to catastrophic system failures that left computers unresponsive. His breaking point came after multiple problematic upgrades affecting family members' computers, including one that rendered a laptop completely unusable during an upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04. Another incident left a relative's system with broken Firefox shortcuts and duplicate status bar icons after updating Lubuntu 18.04. 

Canonical's aggressive push of Snap packages has drawn particular criticism. The forced migration of system components from traditional Debian packages to Snaps resulted in compatibility issues, broken desktop shortcuts, and government ID card authentication failures. In one instance, he writes, a Snap-related bug in the GNOME desktop environment severely disrupted workplace productivity, requiring multiple system restarts to resolve. The author has since switched to Fedora, praising its implementation of Flatpak as a superior alternative to Snaps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Surfing The Ocean&apos;s Biggest Waves | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdpPYy7R82A</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FdpPYy7R82A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 18:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With waves coming from different angles when surfing at Nazaré in Portugal, things here can get extremely dangerous.

#JoyRidePBS

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany before the election - Between hopes and fears | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQqeKbWxH4</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HOQqeKbWxH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 17:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[War in the Middle East, war in Ukraine, migration, rising prices, and more – plenty of reasons for Germany to worry, and just as many to take action.

Following the collapse of Germany’s governing coalition in the fall, early parliamentary elections are now due to take place at the end of February. DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year — a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.

responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
tool to make it faster to categorize
everything.As with all of my surveys the methodology isn’t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.Here are the top categories of frustrations!I think it’s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for 95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 yearsThese comments aren’t coming from total beginners.Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I’m mostly writing this up for myself because
I’m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.People talked about struggles remembering:the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etckeyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etcThere are just so many little “trivia” details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I’ll sometimes forget where it’s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for  and .switching terminals is hard (91)People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)systems which don’t have their preferred text editor (“no vim” or “only vim”)different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)a shell they aren’t used to (“the subtle differences between zsh and bash”)as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.Lots of problems with color, like:programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background colorfinding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etcnot wanting color at all and struggling to turn it offThis comment felt relatable to me:Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I’m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:using  in a browser-based terminal and closing the windowthe terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
, no , no , lots of  shortcuts aren’t
possible like )the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses  for something else)issues using emacs in the terminalbackspace not working (2)other copy and paste issues (75)Aside from “the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different”, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different waysdealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
“middle click” clipboard on Linux, tmux’s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing themrandom spaces added when copying from the terminalpasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying waywanting a way to copy text without using the mouseThere were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint – it’s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I’ve been told by random people over the years.steep learning curve (44)A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don’t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.Some issues with shell history:history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)limits that are too short (4)history not being restored when terminal tabs are restoredlosing history because the terminal crashednot knowing how to search historyIt wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
“history” on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type “history 0” to get
any useful length of history.documentation being generally opaquelack of examples in man pagesprograms which don’t have man pagesHere’s a representative comment:Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflowA few issues with scrollback:programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback historyresizing the terminal messes up the scrollbackGUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs’ outputsWhen resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There’s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or –help?(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems(23) performance (e.g. “my shell takes too long to start”)(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (“The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened”)(16) terminfo issues (“Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.”)(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing , ing a binary, etc)(12) quoting/escaping in the shell(11) various Windows/PowerShell issuesThere were also 122 answers to the effect of “nothing really” or “only that I
can’t do EVERYTHING in the terminal”Think I’ve found work arounds for most/all frustrationsI’m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:remembering syntax & history (often the thing you need to remember is something you’ve run before!)discoverability & the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)“switching systems is hard” & “it feels outdated” (tools that haven’t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
 no matter what system you’re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers’ skills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The South Korean Daewoo K2 rifle with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoUYo2ihDmM</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eoUYo2ihDmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:08:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As seen in Squid Game, this week Jonathan delves into the South Korean service rifle - the Daewoo K2.

In recent decades, Gassed was interpreted as a very yellow painting. But it didn’t always look like that. 

The yellow effect comes from a discoloured varnish from the 1970s, concealing Sargent’s intentions and skewing our interpretation of his work. Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM’s new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.
 
Today we’re going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it’s important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.

ABSTRACT
Edge computing is not a new concept but in the past few years we're seeing powerful tools made more easily available at the edge.
This talk will go into what the edge is, why its increasing availability and adoption is exciting, and ways we can start incorporating the edge into our applications. [...]

By default, when someone uses command-line tools built into Go to download or install packages, requests are routed through the service. A description on the site says the proxy is provided by the Go team and “run by Google.”Since November 2021, the Go Module Mirror has been hosting a backdoored version of a widely used module, security firm Socket said Monday. The file uses “typosquatting,” a technique that gives malicious files names similar to widely used legitimate ones and plants them in popular repositories. In the event someone makes a typo or even a minor variation from the correct name when fetching a file with the command line, they land on the malicious file instead of the one they wanted. (A similar typosquatting scheme is common with domain names, too.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The BEST thing about the M4 Sherman</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIOV8ey1Lrw</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tIOV8ey1Lrw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 12:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Caves of Qud with Brian Bucklew</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/05/caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9626101996.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 10:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Caves of Qud is a roguelike game set in a richly detailed, post-apocalyptic world blending science fiction and fantasy.

In 1642, England was torn apart by a fierce struggle. Royalist armies, loyal to the defiant King Charles I, clashed with the forces of Parliament, igniting a violent civil war that would decide the fate of the monarchy and the nation. In this second episode, we hear about some of the bloodiest battles between Roundheads and Cavaliers, the leaders who came to the fore during these trying years and how the two sides eventually arrived at a shaky truce.For this, Dan is joined by Minoo Dinshaw, author of 'Friends in Youth: Choosing Sides in the English Civil War'.

Schaller discusses how the Red Hat team plans to integrate AI with IBM's open-source Granite engine to enhance developer tools, such as IDEs, and create an AI-powered Code Assistant. He says the team is also working on streamlining AI acceleration in Toolbx and ensuring Fedora users have access to tools like RamaLama. From the post: One big item on our list for the year is looking at ways Fedora Workstation can make use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to IBMs Granite effort we know have an AI engine that is available under proper open source licensing terms and which can be extended for many different usecases. Also the IBM Granite team has an aggressive plan for releasing updated versions of Granite, incorporating new features of special interest to developers, like making Granite a great engine to power IDEs and similar tools. We been brainstorming various ideas in the team for how we can make use of AI to provide improved or new features to users of GNOME and Fedora Workstation. This includes making sure Fedora Workstation users have access to great tools like RamaLama, that we make sure setting up accelerated AI inside Toolbx is simple, that we offer a good Code Assistant based on Granite and that we come up with other cool integration points. "I'm still not sure how I feel about this approach," writes designer/developer and blogger, Bradley Taunt. "While IBM Granite is an open source model, I still don't enjoy so much artificial 'intelligence' creeping into core OS development. This also isn't something optional on the end-users side, like a desktop feature or package. This sounds like it's going to be built directly into the core system."
 
"Red Hat has been pushing hard towards AI and my main concern is having this influence other operating system dev teams. Luckily things seems AI-free in BSD land. For now, at least."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI o3 tries to curb stomp DeepSeek...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoeFxGzPpXE</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PoeFxGzPpXE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:48:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Stay updated with the best dev content at https://daily.dev/fireship

I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much.Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint. However, it fumbled in some key areas--particularly the netcode, which was a bizarre delay-based system in an era when fighting game developers were quickly and vocally embracing superior rollback systems. Now, with a new Virtua Fighter in active development and people talking about the series again, Sega has given us Virtua Fighter 5 REVO: another revision exclusively for PCs with the much-longed-for and player-demanded rollback netcode.The rollback netcode is clearly the major selling point here, as much of the game is still built upon the foundation of VF5 Ultimate Showdown: The menu graphics, interface, and character models are largely the same, with a bit of extra polish and visual flair if you've got solid graphics hardware. But that's fine--those areas didn't need much improvement, so why fix what isn't broken?Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accidental Socialists</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnxHjhtODw</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aZnxHjhtODw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:07:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discussing the Frontier of Particle Physics with Brian Cox</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFIHf5coxE</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/urFIHf5coxE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/startalk to stay fully informed on the latest Space and Science news.

How much more physics is out there to be discovered? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.

We dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.

The conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe’s deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?

To wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe’s vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.

With a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos—and everything in between.

AI & Aliens: New Eyes on Ancient Questions // MLOps Podcast #288 with Richard Cloete, 
Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard University.

// Abstract
Demetrios speaks with Dr. Richard Cloete, a Harvard computer scientist and founder of SEAQR Robotics, about his AI-driven work in tracking Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) through the Galileo Project. Dr. Cloete explains their advanced sensor setup and the challenges of training AI in this niche field, leading to the creation of AeroSynth, a synthetic data tool.

He also discusses his collaboration with the Minor Planet Center on using AI to classify interstellar objects and upcoming telescope data. Additionally, he introduces Seeker Robotics, applying similar AI techniques to oceanic research with unmanned vehicles for marine monitoring. The conversation explores AI’s role in advancing our understanding of space and the ocean.

// Bio
Richard is a computer scientist and Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University. As a member of the Galileo Project under Professor Avi Loeb's supervision, he develops AI models for detecting and tracking aerial objects, specializing in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). 

Beyond UAP research, he collaborates with astronomers at the Minor Planet Center to create AI models for identifying potential interstellar objects using the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. 

Richard is also the CEO and co-founder of SEAQR Robotics, a startup developing advanced unmanned surface vehicles to accelerate the discovery of novel life and phenomena in Earth's oceans and atmosphere. 

Before joining Harvard, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge, UK, where his research explored the intersection of emerging technologies and law.Grew up in Cape Town, South Africa, where I used to build Tesla Coils, plasma globes, radio stethoscopes, microwave guns, AM radios, and bombs...

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he’s been working to educate people.

Unlike many adults, younger people aren’t as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.

Weinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg’s were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.

He finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he’s been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda Dänekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.

This film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.

--

Many of us have experienced feeling stuck. People often report feeling highly motivated at the start and end of a project, but the middle can feel untethered. It can happen when tackling something as simple as a term paper or as monumental as social inequality or the climate crisis. So, are there ways to get unstuck? Shannon Odell digs into the psychology of overcoming your motivational obstacles.

From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.This eBook will guide you through the 6 key requirements all authorization layers should include to avoid technical debt:Architectural and design considerations for building a scalable and secure authorization layer.20+ technologies, approaches, and standards to consider for your permission management systems.Practical insights, based on 500+ interviews with engineers, architects, and IAM professionals.Learn how to create an authorization solution that evolves with your business needs, while avoiding technical debt.How to Scale MicroservicesThey wanted to reduce the maintenance effort and scale microservices quickly.So they relied on automation.A microservice must be scaled to handle changing traffic.Yet scaling manually is slow and causes errors.So they use infrastructure as code to keep things simple; it’s used to deploy new instances based on demand.  means managing and provisioning infrastructure using code.Ready for the next technique?It’s difficult to understand and maintain APIs without a proper naming convention.Yet maintaining consistent naming for APIs across microservices is hard. So they generate APIs using code and store API definitions as JSON in a separate Git repository.Here are the benefits of code-generated APIs:API paths can be validated using linters.API naming conventions and request-response structures are standardized.API version changes can be tracked through tagging.It ensures API operations are defined.User-friendly API paths can be set up as default.Also it standardizes APIs built using different programming languages. Put simply, code generation makes it look like a single person wrote APIs across the system.Besides code generation ensures health checks are included in each microservice.A health check URL is included in the API specification of the microservice.An unhealthy service is removed from production to avoid service interruptions.A change to database schema shouldn’t break microservices depending on it. Yet sharing a single database across microservices introduces tight coupling and failure risk.So they set up separate databases for each microservice.But maintaining many databases is a huge effort; so, they create databases and tables using code.Here are its main benefits:Consistent database names.Ensure proper database indexes exist from the start.Easy to maintain and operate the database.Besides a microservice shouldn't talk to a database owned by another microservice. Instead, communication happens only via the microservice’s API owning the database. Otherwise, the data changes aren't safe as they bypass business logic.: use code generation and automation to scale microservices quickly. It reduces maintenance efforts and helps with version control.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.I launched the newsletter deep dives last month.Yet future deep dives, starting this month, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price.“This newsletter is an amazing resource for learning system design.” AlexSubscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 123,001+ readers strong, very close to 124k.

ABSTRACT
Why is it so easy to screw up platform engineering, and how do you undo the damage?

Platform engineering… it’s the trendy new buzzword. For a thing we’ve been doing for years, ever since someone said “what if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?” It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.

But here’s a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It’s easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there’s a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren’t able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?

I’ve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I’ve had successes, and I’ve had failures. I’ll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:

• Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech
• Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod
• Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets

And I’ll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.

Takeaways
• Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before
• Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you’re using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away
• Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you’re doing that, capture your leadership team’s expectations and track team commitments
• Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you’re stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads
• The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]

Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by Equinix (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As reported by the Phoronix blog, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.
 
An issue ticket on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of the 40-year-old window system) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and many more) used Equinix's donated space. [...] Alpine Linux, a small, security-minded distribution used in many containers and embedded devices, also needs a new home quickly. As detailed in its blog, Alpine Linux uses about 800TB of bandwidth each month and also needs continuous integration runners (or separate job agents), as well as a development box. Alpine states it is seeking co-location space and bare-metal servers near the Netherlands, though it will consider virtual machines if bare metal is not feasible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maximizing Cloud Efficiency with Jerzy Grzywinski and Brent Segner</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/04/maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED1045788818.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 10:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Compute optimization in a cloud environment is a common challenge because of the need to balance performance, cost, and resource availability.

A customer places an order, and your system needs to deduct the item from inventory, charge the customer’s credit card, and record the sale in your accounting system—all at once. What happens if the payment fails but your inventory count has already been reduced? Or if your application crashes halfway through the process?This is where  come into play. They ensure that all the steps in such critical operations happen reliably and consistently.ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and In this article, we’ll dive into what each of the ACID properties mean, why they are important, and how they are implemented in databases.A  in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records) that the database treats as . It either fully succeeds or fully fails, with no in-between states.When you send money to a friend, two things happen:Money is deducted from your account.Money is added to their account.These two steps form . If either step fails, both are canceled.Without transactions, databases could end up in inconsistent states. : Your money is deducted, but your friend never receives it.: Two people booking the last movie ticket at the same time.Transactions solve these problems by enforcing rules like  (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).Now, lets looks at each of the ACID properties.Atomicity ensures that a transaction—comprising multiple operations—executes as a unit of work: it either  succeeds (commits) or  fails (rolls back). If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to a state exactly as it was before the transaction began.In a money transfer transaction, if the credit step fails, the debit step cannot be allowed to stand on its own. This prevents inconsistent states like “money disappearing” from one account without showing up in another.Atomicity abstracts away the complexity of manually undoing changes if something goes wrong.How Databases Implement AtomicityDatabases use two key mechanisms to guarantee atomicity.1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logs)Every operation is recorded in a  before it’s applied to the actual database table.If a failure occurs, the database uses this log to  incomplete changes.Once the WAL entry is safely on disk, the database proceeds with modifying the in-memory pages that contain rows for  and .When the operations succeed:The database marks  as  in the transaction log.The newly updated balances for A and B will eventually get flushed from memory to their respective data files on disk.If the database crashes  the log entry is written but  the data files are fully updated, the WAL provides a way to recover:On restart, the database checks the WAL.It sees  was committed.It reapplies the  operations to ensure the final balances are correct in the data files.If the transaction had not committed (or was marked as “in progress”) at the time of the crash, the database would  those changes using information in the log, leaving the table as if the transaction never happened.2. Commit/Rollback ProtocolsDatabases provide commands like , , and Any changes made between  and  are considered “in-progress” and won’t be permanently applied unless the transaction commits successfully.If any step fails, or if you explicitly issue a , all changes since the start of the transaction are undone. in the context of ACID transactions ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another valid state—never leaving it in a broken or “invalid” state.It means that all the data integrity constraints, such as  (no duplicate IDs),  (related records must exist in parent tables), and (age can’t be negative), are satisfied before and after the transaction.If a transaction tries to violate these rules, it will not be committed, and the database will revert to its previous state.You have two tables in an e-commerce database: (with columns: , , etc.) (with columns: , , , etc.): You can’t place an order for a product if  is greater than the  in the  table.If the product’s  was 8 (less than what we’re trying to order), the database sees that the new value would be  which breaks the consistency rule (it should not go negative).The transaction fails or triggers a rollback, preventing the database from ending in an invalid state.How to Implement ConsistencyDatabase Schema Constraints, , , ,  constraints, and other schema definitions ensure no invalid entries are allowed.Triggers and Stored ProceduresTriggers can automatically check additional rules whenever rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.Stored procedures can contain logic to validate data before committing.Application-Level SafeguardsWhile the database enforces constraints at a lower level, applications often add extra checks—like ensuring business rules are followed or data is validated before it even reaches the database layer. ensures that concurrently running transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.Essentially, while a transaction is in progress, its updates (or intermediate data) remain invisible to other ongoing transactions—giving the illusion that each transaction is running sequentially, one at a time.Without isolation, two or more transactions could read and write partial or uncommitted data from each other, causing incorrect or inconsistent results.With isolation, developers can reason more reliably about how data changes will appear to other transactions.To understand how isolation works, it helps to see what can go wrong without proper isolation.  Common concurrency anomalies include:Transaction A reads data that Transaction B has modified but not yet committed.If Transaction B then rolls back, Transaction A ends up holding an invalid or “dirty” value that never truly existed in the committed state.Transaction A reads the same row(s) multiple times during its execution but sees different data because another transaction updated or deleted those rows in between A’s reads.Transaction A performs a query that returns a set of rows. Another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that match A’s query conditions.If A re-runs the same query, it sees a different set of rows (“phantoms”).Databases typically allow you to choose an , which balances data correctness with performance.Higher isolation levels provide stronger data consistency but can reduce system performance by increasing the wait times for transactions. Let's explore the four common isolation levels:Allows dirty reads; transactions can see uncommitted changes.Rarely used, as it can lead to severe anomalies.A transaction sees only data that has been committed at the moment of reading.Prevents dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.Ensures if you read the same rows multiple times within a transaction, you’ll get the same values (unless you explicitly modify them).Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads may still happen (depending on the database engine).The highest level of isolation, acting as if all transactions happen sequentially one at a time.Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.Most expensive in terms of performance and concurrency because it can require more locking or more conflict checks.How Databases Enforce IsolationPessimistic Concurrency ControlRows or tables are locked so that no other transaction can read or write them until the lock is released.Can lead to blocking or deadlocks if multiple transactions compete for the same locks.2. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)Optimistic Concurrency ControlInstead of blocking reads, the database keeps multiple versions of a row.Readers see a consistent snapshot of data (like a point-in-time view), while writers create a new version of the row when updating.This approach reduces lock contention but requires carefully managing row versions and cleanup (vacuuming in PostgreSQL, for example).A form of MVCC where each transaction sees data as it was at the start (or a consistent point) of the transaction.Prevents non-repeatable reads and dirty reads. Phantom reads may still occur unless the isolation level is fully serializable. ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made will survive, even in the face of power failures, crashes, or other catastrophic events. In other words, once a transaction says “done,” the data is permanently recorded and cannot simply disappear.How Databases Ensure Durability1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logging)Most relational databases rely on a  to preserve changes before they’re written to the main data files:: The intended operations (updates, inserts, deletes) are recorded in the WAL on durable storage (disk).: Once the WAL entry is safely persisted, the database can mark the transaction as committed.Apply Changes to Main Data Files: The updated data eventually gets written to the main files—possibly first in memory, then flushed to disk.If the database crashes, it uses the WAL during :: Any committed transactions not yet reflected in the main files are reapplied.: Any incomplete (uncommitted) transactions are rolled back to keep the database consistent.2. Replication / RedundancyIn addition to WAL, many systems use replication to ensure data remains durable even if hardware or an entire data center fails.: Writes are immediately copied to multiple nodes or data centers. A transaction is marked committed only if the primary and at least one replica confirm it’s safely stored.: Changes eventually sync to other nodes, but there is a (small) window where data loss can occur if the primary fails before the replica is updated.Regular  provide a safety net beyond logs and replication. In case of severe corruption, human error, or catastrophic failure:: Capture the entire database at a point in time.Incremental/Differential Backups: Store changes since the last backup for faster, more frequent backups.: Ensures backups remain safe from localized disasters, allowing you to restore data even if hardware is damaged.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The Verge's Lauren Feiner reports: NetChoice has become one of the fiercest -- and most successful -- opponents of age verification, moderation, and design code laws, all of which would put new obligations on tech platforms and change how users experience the internet. [...] NetChoice's latest suit opposes the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a rule that echoes a California law of a similar name. In the California litigation, NetChoice notched a partial win in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the district court's decision to block a part of the law requiring platforms to file reports about their services' impact on kids. (It sent another part of the law back to the lower court for further review.)
 
A similar provision in Maryland's law is at the center of NetChoice's complaint. The group says that Maryland's reporting requirement lets regulators subjectively determine the "best interests of children," inviting "discriminatory enforcement." The reporting requirement on tech companies essentially mandates them "to disparage their services and opine on far-ranging and ill-defined harms that could purportedly arise from their services' 'design' and use of information," NetChoice alleges. NetChoice points out that both California and Maryland have passed separate online privacy laws, which NetChoice Litigation Center director Chris Marchese says shows that "lawmakers know how to write laws to protect online privacy when what they want to do is protect online privacy."
 
Supporters of the Maryland law say legislators learned from California's challenges and "optimized" their law to avoid questions about speech, according to Tech Policy Press. In a blog analyzing Maryland's approach, Future of Privacy Forum points out that the state made some significant changes from California's version -- such as avoiding an "express obligationâ to determine users' ages and defining the "best interests of children." The NetChoice challenge will test how well those changes can hold up to First Amendment scrutiny. NetChoice has consistently maintained that even well-intentioned attempts to protect kids online are likely to backfire. Though the Maryland law does not explicitly require the use of specific age verification tools, Marchese says it essentially leaves tech platforms with a no-win decision: collect more data on users to determine their ages and create varied user experiences or cater to the lowest common denominator and self-censor lawful content that might be considered inappropriate for its youngest users. And similar to its arguments in other cases, Marchese worries that collecting more data to identify users as minors could create a "honey pot" of kids' information, creating a different problem in attempting to solve another.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/130</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/130/changelog-news-130.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Sh tracked himself down through in-app ads, Sniffnet comfortably monitors your Internet traffic, Cate Huston opines on what makes a good team, Victor Shepelev draws on 25 years of coding to share seven things he now knows & Grant Slatton tells you how to write a good design document.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

In 2013, incarcerated individuals in California’s Pelican Bay Prison assembled a historic hunger strike to protest decades-long sentences of solitary confinement. The defiance united over 30,000 inmates from diverse backgrounds in a powerful display of solidarity. This act garnered national attention and shed light on the inhumane conditions of The SHU (Security Housing Units). “The Strike” highlights the strength of prisoner-led resistance and the transformative power of collective organizing.

I've been there twice, and both times been involved in messy brawls despite not tasting a lick of alcohol. The second of these fisticuffs was against a small group of Cuman deserters. They seemed nice enough, but I was still wary considering the Cumans are who killed my parents a few months back. I wasn't the only one, and after failing to ease the growing tension, I decided to side with the local townspeople when push came to shove.Needless to say, we didn't put up much of a fight. Once the Cumans left, one of the locals implored me to track them down and deal with them once and for all. After eventually tracking them down, the sole Czech-speaking Cuman was so welcoming that I ended up getting drunk with them. I got so inebriated, in fact, that my night revolved around almost drowning, playing matchmaker for one of the soldiers, and then having a conversation with a talking dog that definitely wasn't real. This night of revelry would've been fine on any other evening, but I promised two new acquaintances that I'd be up bright and early to join them on a critical mission. Even after sleeping for seven hours, I was still completely plastered when I arose from my stupor. And let me tell you, fighting bandits with blurred vision, a swaying body, and a soundtrack of frequent farting isn't ideal.To some, this last part might sound utterly infuriating. To me, and others like me, this is part of what makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 utterly enticing. This is a game that sings when you're swept up in an entertaining series of events ignited by the consequences of your actions; where the game's quest design and emphasis on player choice wonderfully intertwine with its systems-driven sandbox to create a wholly immersive experience. While its 2018 predecessor was often disrupted by technical issues--which were further exacerbated by a frustrating save system--and clunky combat, Kingdom Come 2 refines and improves upon it in every respect. The obtuse nature of some of its RPG systems still won't click for everybody, but this is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization VII Review - A Fine But Flawed Foundation</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Jason Rodriguez</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/123/1239113/4436780-civilization-vii-review-.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sid Meier's Civilization VII is the newest mainline entry in Firaxis' long-running 4X strategy series, which is built on exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating across procedurally generated maps. Taken on its own, each campaign remains a superbly engaging escapade across eras that will keep you playing for "one more turn" until you realize you're late for your sister's birthday party. Civilization VII is not just a game that you play to pass the time during weekends--the experience is compelling enough that it  the weekend, and maybe several weekdays of your life, too.For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period. Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes.One of the biggest changes in Civilization VII is how you choose leaders and nations separately. Gone are the days when picking Augustus Caesar or Napoleon meant automatically playing as Rome or France, respectively. Instead, leaders have a unique trait that defines their playstyle, and you can select a country independently to complement that playstyle.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>@krausefx about a scary #iPhone Camera Feature, that has now been resolved</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6epHFkG_Y</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sO6epHFkG_Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 13:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #GOTOcph #Privacy #Mobile #HowIsFelixToday #FelixKrause #KrauseFX #Fastlane #Security #InAppBrowsers #SFSafari #iOS #Apple #Safari #Android #JavaScript #TikTok #Instagram #Viral #ViralShorts #GOTO

But long-time Slashdot reader theodp complains it's a "gushing how-to-make-Agile-even-better opinion piece."

Like other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management "has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development. Indeed, among the three examples of success offered in the piece to "highlight the effectiveness of agile methods in navigating complex stakeholder dynamics and achieving project success" is Atlassian's use of agile practices to market and develop its products, many of which are coincidentally designed to support Agile practices and teams (including Jira). How meta. 

Citing "recent studies," the piece concludes its call for stakeholder engagement by noting that "59% of organizations measure Agile success by customer or user satisfaction." But that is one of those metrics that can create perverse incentives. Empirical studies of user satisfaction and engagement have been published since the 1970's, and sadly one of the cruel lessons learned from them is that the easiest path to having satisfied users is to avoid working on difficult problems. Keep that in mind when you ponder why difficult user stories seem to languish forever in the Kanban and Scrum Board "Ice Box" column, while the "Complete" column is filled with low-hanging fruit. Sometimes success does come easy! So, are you in the Agile-is-Heaven or Agile-is-Hell camp?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Primary Hustle For Homeless in Vegas</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwJF7Smr2M</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VOwJF7Smr2M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:59:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew and Glen go scavenging for copper wire, which is one of the primary hustles for the homeless in Vegas]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Admits Linux-Post Crackdown Was &apos;In Error&apos;, Fixes Moderation Error</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1837253/facebook-admits-linux-post-crackdown-was-in-error-fixes-moderation-error?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tom's Hardware reports:

Facebook's heavy-handed censorship of Linux groups and topics was "in error," the social media juggernaut has admitted. Responding to reports earlier this week, sparked by the curious censorship of the eminently wholesome DistroWatch, Facebook contacted PCMag to say that it had made a mistake and that the underlying issue had been rectified. 

"This enforcement was in error and has since been addressed. Discussions of Linux are allowed on our services," said a Meta rep to PCMag. That is the full extent of the statement reproduced by the source... Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has appealed against the Community Standards-triggered ban shortly after it noticed it was in effect (January 19). PCMag received the Facebook admission of error on January 28. The latest statement from DistroWatch, which now prefers posting on Mastodon, indicates that Facebook has lifted the DistroWatch links ban. 


More details from PCMag:

Meta didn't say what caused the crackdown in the first place. But the company has been revamping some of its content moderation and plans to replace its fact-checking methodology with a user-driven Community Notes, similar to X. "We're also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms," the company said earlier this month, in another irony. 
"Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn't have been," Meta added in the same post.

These films and shows have created a romanticized image of the Mafia—made men who rose from nothing to rule over powerful crime families. It’s all about money, power, loyalty, and a paradoxical code of honor.

But how much of this is fact, and how much is fiction? In this video, we dive into the myths created by Hollywood and compare them to the real-world history of organized crime.

"The teachers faded away pretty quickly," Gates adds, "But about six of us stayed hardcore. One was Paul Allen..." — the future co-founder of Microsoft. And the experience clearly meant a lot to Gates. "Microsoft just never would've happened without Paul — and this teletype room." 

In a longer post thanking his "brilliant" teachers, Gates calls his teletype experience "an encounter that would shape my entire future" and "opened up a whole new world for me." Gates also thanks World War II Navy pilot and Boeing engineer Bill Dougall, who "was instrumental in bringing computer access to our school, something he and other faculty members pushed for after taking a summer computer class... The fascinating thing about Mr. Dougall was that he didn't actually know much about programming; he exhausted his knowledge within a week. But he had the vision to know it was important and the trust to let us students figure it out." 

Gates shared a similar memory about the computer-room's 20-something overseer Fred Wright, who "intuitively understood that the best way to get students to learn was to let us explore on our own terms. There was no sign-up sheet, no locked door, no formal instruction."

Instead, Mr. Wright let us figure things out ourselves and trusted that, without his guidance, we'd have to get creative... Some of the other teachers argued for tighter regulations, worried about what we might be doing in there unsupervised. But even though Mr. Wright occasionally popped in to break up a squabble or listen as someone explained their latest program, for the most part he defended our autonomy... 
Mr. Wright gave us something invaluable: the space to discover our own potential.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can “reason” to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

From the report: The Terminal app first appeared in the Android 15 QPR2 beta as a developer option, and it still remains locked behind developer settings. Since its initial public release, Google pushed a few changes that fixed issues with the installation process and added a settings menu to resize the disk, forward ports, and backup the installation. However, the biggest changes the company has been working on, which include adding hardware acceleration support and a full graphical environment, have not been pushed to any public releases.
 
Thankfully, since Google is working on this feature in the open, it's possible to simply compile a build of AOSP with these changes added in. This gives us the opportunity to trial upcoming features of the Android Linux Terminal app before a public release. To demonstrate, we fired up the Linux Terminal on a Pixel 9 Pro, tapped a new button on the top right to enter the Display activity, and then ran the 'weston' command to open up a graphical environment. (Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)
 
We also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why This D.C.

The story of Chrissy Teigen’s paternal great-grandparents was largely unknown to her. Research determines that she is descended from multiple generations of musicians, and from the Sinti people, a subgroup of the Romani people. The Roma, or Romani people were often denigrated as Gypsies, but it explains why Teigen’s ancestors moved so often.

Chrissy Teigen is a New York Times #1 bestselling author, TV personality and the founder of food and lifestyle brand Cravings. In 2016, Teigen released “Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat” which debuted #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and marked the first time a cookbook debuted #1 on USA Today's best-seller list. Teigen cohosted and executive produced “Chrissy & Dave Dine Out” with David Chang. She also executive produced and starred in “Chrissy’s Court”, executive produced the HBO Max documentary series “The Way Down”, and starred opposite Tina Fey and Nat Faxon in the Netflix animated comedy series “Mulligan”.

Our ability to learn about phenomena and worlds that seem almost
impossibly out of reach, now give us an incredible insight into the universe we occupy, and how we got here.

Brian and Robin find out about some of the big new missions providing information into our own solar system and beyond, and find out what big questions in cosmology still remain a tantalising challenge?

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can see the History Hit film about the house here:You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'. He also has a new book out for children.

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles.I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Neandertals morning people?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSchvm7lLOw</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vSchvm7lLOw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

We provide an examination of SDcpp, its components, and the technical concepts that enable efficient inference of Stable Diffusion models on lower-end hardware such as CPUs and lightweight GPUs, such as Apple M-series chips. In particular, we’re looking at Flux.1, a text-to-image model developed by Black Forest Labs.Introduction to Diffusion Models and Stable DiffusionDiffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have emerged as powerful generative frameworks capable of producing high-fidelity images from random noise through iterative denoising processes. Stable Diffusion extends the DDPM framework by incorporating text conditioning, allowing for the generation of images based on descriptive prompts. However, the computational demands of such models typically necessitate high-memory, high-bandwidth GPU resources, limiting their accessibility and scalability.SDcpp addresses these limitations by providing an optimized inference framework that leverages techniques such as quantization, memory-efficient sampling, and optimized latent space representations to facilitate the deployment of Stable Diffusion models on devices with constrained computational resources. This paper delves into the architectural and algorithmic components of SDcpp, highlighting the methodologies that underpin its efficiency and performance.The architecture is composed of several interdependent modules, each contributing to the inference process. First, it is loading the required models (1), including text encoders, the diffusion model, and the VAE decoder. It then performs  (2), tokenizing the input prompt and generating text embeddings using a CLIP-based model and an additional T5XXL text conditioning model. Next, it computes the conditioning graph (3), transforming embeddings to create a guidance vector for the diffusion process. The system then  (4) by iteratively refining a randomly initialized latent tensor using a noise schedule and a chosen sampling method, progressively steering it towards a structured latent representation in a number of . This step is the most compute-intensive, consuming roughly 90% of the total processing time. Once sampling completes, the pipeline decodes the latent representation (5) using a VAE model to reconstruct pixel-space information. Finally, it  (6) as an image file, completing the text-to-image generation process.Diffusion Model Core ComponentsThe diffusion model within SDcpp is the principal generative engine, responsible for transforming Gaussian noise into coherent images through a series of denoising . More steps allow finer details and smoother outputs but increase inference time, as each step requires additional computation. This process is governed by the DDPM framework, wherein the model iteratively refines the image by removing noise in a controlled manner. The diffusion model encompasses three primary components:UNet (Denoising Network): the UNet architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and reconstruction. The network predicts and removes noise at each denoising step, progressively enhancing image quality.Text Encoder (Conditioning Module): The text encoder converts textual prompts into latent embeddings that guide the denoising process. SDcpp supports multiple text encoders, including CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5XXL, each tailored for different model versions and memory considerations.Scheduler (Noise Controller): The scheduler orchestrates the noise removal strategy, dictating the temporal progression of denoising steps. It determines the rate and manner in which noise is reduced, balancing computational efficiency and image fidelity.A recent model,  , is optimized for low-resource environments, featuring a compact UNet architecture that accelerates inference by reducing the number of denoising steps. Flux.1 is designed for memory-efficient quantization and compatibility with the GGUF format, making it suitable for deployment on lightweight hardware. It reduces inference steps to only 4 steps and can achieve fast inference.Variational Autoencoder (VAE)VAEs facilitating the encoding of images into a lower-dimensional latent space. This reduction significantly diminishes computational and memory overhead while retaining high-resolution image details. Latent space is a compact mathematical representation of an image. Think of it as a highly efficient shorthand where only the most essential details are stored. Instead of storing every pixel, the image is encoded as numbers that describe its features. This makes it possible to work with images at a much lower computational cost. Stable Diffusion doesn’t generate images pixel by pixel. Instead, it creates images in latent space, where information is stored in a more compact and manageable way. Once the model finishes generating an image in this space, the VAE  it back into a high-resolution format that we can see.Different VAEs can influence how well the final image looks. A generic VAE works for most images, but a model trained for a specific style, like anime or realistic photography, may use a custom VAE to better match its training data. A poorly matched VAE can cause color shifts, blurriness, or unwanted artifacts.Technically, any model can use any VAE, but results vary. A VAE trained on cartoon-style images won’t reconstruct a photorealistic image correctly. This is why some models provide their own VAEs — they have been optimized to maintain details that matter most for a specific style.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)LoRA facilitates model customization without the need to adjust the entire diffusion model. By modifying only a small subset of parameters (~10 million), LoRA significantly reduces memory usage compared to full model fine-tuning. Multiple LoRAs can be combined with weighted influences on the final image, enabling diverse stylistic and feature modifications. For instance, combining two LoRAs with different weights can be executed using the syntax <lora:styleA:0.6> <lora:styleB:0.8>. To optimize performance, it is advisable to minimize the number and strength of LoRAs, especially in memory-limited environments.Training and Inference File FormatsThe  is the standard PyTorch checkpoint format, that stores full precision weights and optimizer states. Supports training and fine-tuning but can execute arbitrary Python code, posing security risks. SafeTensors (.safetensors) is a safer alternative to CKPT, with structured, immutable storage and no executable code. Loads faster but still used mainly for training.GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary model format introduced by llama.cpp, succeeding GGML. Initially designed for language models (like LLaMA models), GGUF has been adopted in diffusion models to enable efficient, quantized inference without reformatting model files into proprietary formats (e.g., .ggml or .gguf conversions required previously). Traditional formats (.safetensors, .ckpt, .bin) store full-precision FP16/FP32 model weights, consuming significant VRAM. GGUF introduces quantization at multiple levels, storing models in 2-bit to 16-bit precision while maintaining compatibility with SDcpp.Use GGUF for efficient inference on low-resource devices, prefer .safetensors for training.In our experiments,  demonstrates an extremely fast denoising process, with images at 1 and 2 steps appearing nearly identical, suggesting that most structural information is determined in the very first iterations. By 4 steps, images diverge significantly, and by 6 steps, they change even more, indicating that additional steps introduce large variations rather than just refining details. Interestingly, Euler and Euler_a produce the best results, likely because they follow a balanced noise reduction trajectory, allowing structure to form naturally without over-smoothing or excessive deviations. Euler introduces noticeable changes between 3, 4, and 6 steps, including shifts in pose, face, and hair color, implying that it follows a latent space trajectory where small step changes can drastically impact the final result. Euler_a, being an ancestral sampler, adds controlled randomness at each step, further amplifying these changes. In contrast, LCM performs poorly with Flux 1, excessively blurring images, likely due to its tuning for models that require more iterative refinement, making it unsuitable for Flux 1’s fast-converging architecture. We observed that 4 steps often produce better images than 5 or 6 steps, as extra iterations introduce unnecessary alterations instead of improving details, reinforcing that Flux 1 is optimized for extremely low-step inference. This is a stark contrast to Stable Diffusion models like SD 1.5 or SDXL, which typically require 20–50 steps for high-quality outputs. These findings highlight that Flux 1’s unique training favors fewer steps with the right sampler, making Euler and Euler_a better choices at around 4 steps, while models like LCM fail due to excessive denoising.Denoising Schedules and Sampling IntegrationDenoising schedules define a series of noise levels that guide reverse diffusion. These schedules set discrete or continuous noise decay steps, essentially parameterizing the stochastic differential equation used to reverse the diffusion process. Discrete schedules apply abrupt noise transitions, forcing the model to rapidly shift between latent states. In contrast, smooth schedules such as karras or exponential distribute noise reduction evenly, supporting more accurate latent updates.Sampling methods numerically integrate these latent trajectories. Euler-type samplers update the latent state with fixed time step approximations, benefiting from stable transitions when paired with smooth noise decay. Latent Consistency Models (LCM) depend on gradual noise reduction; abrupt schedules can induce over-smoothing and detail loss. Our observations indicate that matching a sampling method’s sensitivity to noise decay with an appropriate denoising schedule is key to preserving image structure while ensuring efficient inference.Flux.1’s behavior indicates that its training regime emphasizes rapid structure formation in early steps. Euler’s robustness across discrete, exponential, and karras schedules suggests that its integration of abrupt noise transitions still aligns well with Flux.1’s latent dynamics. LCM, being more sensitive to the noise decay, only works well with smoother schedules (exponential and karras) that provide gradual latent updates.The failures with AYS and GITS imply that these schedules impose noise trajectories incompatible with Flux.1’s fast-convergence design. Their latent paths likely diverge from the model’s learned reverse diffusion trajectory, causing the state to collapse into uniform or noisy outputs rather than structured images. This sensitivity reinforces that Flux.1 is optimized for few-step denoising with specific noise decay characteristics, and departures from that — especially with schedules that enforce alternative trajectory regularity — can disrupt the image generation process.Flux.1 departs from prior diffusion models by leveraging a T5-style text encoder instead of CLIP, allowing it to process full sentences fluently rather than relying on discrete token hierarchies. Unlike Stable Diffusion, where Booru-style tags and keyword emphasis are required for precision, Flux.1 understands natural language natively, reducing reliance on rigid token structures. Long, descriptive prompts yield better scene coherence, material accuracy, and relational awareness than fragmented keyword lists.Trigger words are optional rather than mandatory, as the model activates concepts contextually rather than requiring explicit token matching. However, structured elements — short modifiers or category cues — can refine specificity without overpowering Flux.1’s broader language comprehension. The model is particularly strong at multi-concept blending, which traditionally caused token interference in CLIP-based architectures. Negative prompting is also more effective, reducing the unintended blending of attributes.Flux.1 performs best with contextual and relational descriptions, leveraging semantic depth over isolated tokens. While Booru tags still function, hybrid prompting — mixing structured elements with full sentences — offers the best balance between control and generative adaptability.LoRA functions differently in Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion. Since Flux.1 uses a T5-based encoder, LoRA activation does not require fixed trigger words but instead responds dynamically to natural descriptions. This allows LoRAs to integrate seamlessly into prompts without rigid dependencies.Key parameters such as network dimension, alpha scaling, and captioning density influence performance. Higher network dimension strengthens adaptation but risks overfitting, while alpha scaling balances LoRA integration with the base model. Flux.1’s LoRAs benefit from mixed captioning strategies — varying between short tags and natural descriptions — ensuring activation without over-constraining the generative process. Unlike SDXL, which often requires explicit weight scaling (1.2–1.5x) to activate LoRAs, Flux.1 adapts LoRA strength more organically within context, reducing the need for manual weight adjustments.To maximize LoRA performance in Flux.1, descriptive phrasing should replace rigid token triggers, using context-driven prompts to activate learned modifications naturally. Captions should balance specificity with generalization, ensuring LoRAs enhance rather than dominate the generative output.Optimization Strategies for Low-Resource InferenceQuantization is a pivotal technique in reducing model size and memory usage by lowering the precision of model weights. SDcpp supports various quantization levels, each offering a different balance between memory efficiency and image quality: Reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to full precision (FP16) while maintaining good image quality. It introduces a slight computational overhead due to dequantization but is optimal for low-end hardware. Offers slightly better precision than Q4 at the cost of requiring twice the memory. It is suitable for systems with more VRAM where higher image fidelity is desired.For lower-end hardware, Q4_K provides a good balance of speed and quality, while  is better for systems with more VRAM (>16GB).Quantization Impact of Model PartsWe’re loading a model, vae, clip, and t5, and can choose quantized parts for each. The model itself must be quantized due to memory constraints, but the VAE, CLIP, and T5 can remain in higher precision. We tested a q4_K model with safetensors in higher precision, and a fully quantized version where all parts were q4_0.We observed a 2.5x slowdown with the fully quantized run, despite reduced memory usage. Likely due to increased dequantization overhead, precision mismatch-induced stalls, and reduced SIMD efficiency on the Apple M2. While background processes may have contributed to higher involuntary context switches (3.3M vs. 1.48M), they do not fully explain the slowdown. The quantization format (q4_K vs. q4_0) influences computational efficiency rather than raw inference speed, with q4_K employing grouped quantization, which improves data locality and reduces dequantization frequency, while q4_0 likely applies simpler per-tensor quantization, increasing compute overhead. The hybrid approach—quantizing only the diffusion model while keeping VAE, CLIP, and T5 in higher precision—seems to better utilize hardware by avoiding unnecessary precision conversion costs and leveraging FP computation optimizations. These results suggest that full quantization may degrade performance when not optimized for architectural strengths, particularly on FP-optimized hardware like the M2.The sampling method determines the strategy by which noise is removed during the denoising process. Ancestral samplers introduce random variations at each step, leading to more diverse outputs, while fixed-step samplers follow a deterministic trajectory, yielding consistent results.SDcpp integrates several sampling algorithms optimized for different performance criteria: A simple and fast method effective with a lower number of denoising steps, suitable for rapid inference. Prioritizes image quality, requiring more steps and memory. It is ideal for applications where high detail is essential.Latent Consistency Models (LCM): Optimizes speed by drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps (e.g., 4–8 instead of 20–30), making it highly suitable for low-end systems. Users can specify the sampling method using the --sampling-method flag, such as --sampling-method lcm.Memory management is critical in ensuring that diffusion models run efficiently on constrained hardware. SDcpp employs several techniques to optimize memory usage: By processing the VAE decoder in smaller, manageable segments, VAE tiling minimizes peak memory usage. Flash Attention optimizes memory allocation during UNet computations. On CUDA-enabled GPUs, it offers significant memory savings and speed improvements. Flash Attention can be activated via the --diffusion-fa flag.In our experiments on an Apple M2, enabling --vae-tiling reduced memory usage but increased execution time, suggesting a trade-off between efficiency and speed. When --diffusion-fa (Flash Attention) was enabled, execution time did not significantly improve. The combination of both options (vae-tiling and diffusion-fa) resulted in the  but also the , confirming that while these settings help on low-VRAM devices, they introduce performance overhead. The fastest run occurred with both options disabled, though it had the highest memory footprint.Image resolution directly impacts both memory consumption and inference speed. Generating images at a resolution of 1280×640 requires approximately 2.5 times the memory of generating images at 512×512. To accommodate low-resource environments, users can opt for intermediate resolutions such as 768×384 or 1024×512, balancing image quality and computational efficiency.LoRA Delay and Conditioning Graph RecalculationWhen LoRA modules are applied, the conditioning graph must be recalculated due to LoRA’s modification of internal activations, which can reintroduce dependencies on structured tagging if the LoRA was trained on datasets requiring them. The conditioner parses and reweights prompt segments dynamically, adjusting token influence based on LoRA-induced shifts in the embedding space, ensuring compatibility between the altered diffusion model state and the input text. This recalibration process accounts for the delay seen post-LoRA application and before sampling, as the system must harmonize LoRA-induced parameter shifts with Flux.1’s inherently context-aware text encoding.Classifier-Free Guidance ScaleCFG scale (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale) can be set with the --cfg-scale argument. It defaults to 7.0 and controls how strictly the model follows the text prompt, balancing adherence and creativity. Higher values (e.g., 10-15) force the model to generate images that closely match the prompt but can introduce artifacts, while lower values (e.g., 1-5) allow more randomness and artistic interpretation. It impacts performance slightly because higher CFG values increase the weight difference between conditional (prompted) and unconditional (random) predictions, requiring additional computation to balance them. However, the effect on inference speed is minor compared to factors like resolution, model architecture, and sampling steps.Flux.1 seem to have been trained with  as target setting, meaning its internal weighting and contrast are optimized for that value. Lowering CFG to  reduces guidance too much, allowing excessive noise influence, resulting in darker, underexposed images. Raising it to 2.0 strengthens prompt adherence but overemphasizes highlights and contrast, making images appear overly bright. Unlike standard Stable Diffusion, where 7.0 is the default for balanced outputs, Flux.1’s tuning makes , with deviations causing unintended brightness shifts.To analyze the impact of CFG scale on image generation, we generated eight images using CFG 1.0 and 2.0 across the Euler, LCM, iPNDM, and Euler_a samplers with 4 steps and a fixed seed of 42, using the prompt “a beautiful girl in futuristic Tokyo, neon lights,” comparing how different guidance levels influence brightness, contrast, and prompt adherence.Memory-Efficient InferenceRunning Flux.1 (schnell) on an Apple M2 (16GB RAM), we achieve inference without a GPU, completing a 256×256 image in 216.3s with 9.28GB RAM usage. The UNet required just 96.59MB, and VAE decoding used 416MB, demonstrating the efficiency of quantized GGUF models.Our analysis of Stable-Diffusion.cpp and Flux.1 demonstrates that efficient local diffusion inference is feasible even on low-resource hardware, provided that model selection, quantization, and sampling strategies are optimized. Flux.1’s extremely low-step denoising makes it uniquely suited for fast inference, especially when paired with Euler and Euler_a samplers, which balance structure formation and controlled randomness. In contrast, models like LCM introduce excessive smoothing, making them unsuitable for Flux.1’s fast convergence.We also observed that 4 steps yield optimal results with Flux.1, as additional iterations introduce unnecessary alterations rather than improving image fidelity. While our results indicate that full quantization introduces dequantization overhead and computational stalls, external factors such as background system load may have influenced the extent of the observed slowdown. Memory-efficient techniques such as VAE tiling and Flash Attention can reduce hardware requirements but may introduce performance trade-offs. Users should select Q4_K or similar quantization for lower-end hardware, as grouped quantization schemes appear to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with fully quantized inference.These findings highlight that with the right model architecture, quantization, and sampler choice, high-quality image generation is possible on constrained devices without relying on high-end GPUs. Future improvements may focus on further refining model architectures like Flux.1 and optimizing quantization methods for even faster, memory-efficient inference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ups and downs of stratified cross-validation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpK9pWZGjbE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EpK9pWZGjbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you use GridSearchCV in scikit-learn will do a cross-validated hyperparameter search.

The concepts covered here are equally applicable to other large-scale video platforms such as  and .Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.Users should be able to  video files.Uploaded videos must be  into multiple resolutions (e.g., 240p, 360p, 720p, 1080p) to support different network conditions and devices.Users should be able to  videos in real-time with adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust quality based on network conditions.Users can  for videos by title, tags, or description.Users can  and  on videos.Users should be able to create and subscribe to .Non-Functional Requirements: The system should support millions of concurrent users and thousands of video uploads per minute.

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

German submarine, surface and air attacks were sinking merchant ships by the hundred. If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

  development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck.
  It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty
  communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so
  advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are
  plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult.
  The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like Extreme Programming, where developers swiftly put changes into
  production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy,
  and there is regular contact with The Customer.Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more
  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often
  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us
  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural
  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible
  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do
  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for
  The Forest to submit to desertification.) In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks
  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert
  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more

1720 was a year of two bubbles and a plague.  The bubbles were the Mississippi Company in France –and the South Sea Bubble in England. In September 1720 - when the bubble burst, England was plunged into an economic and political crisis. This was one of the first examples of a financial boom and bust and was the event that gave rise to the use of the term bubble to describe a spectacular market failure.

This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting.Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple chips can be hacked to leak secrets from Gmail, iCloud, and more</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-M3-chip-series_screen-1152x648.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple-designed chips powering Macs, iPhones, and iPads contain two newly discovered vulnerabilities that leak credit card information, locations, and other sensitive data from the Chrome and Safari browsers as they visit sites such as iCloud Calendar, Google Maps, and Proton Mail.The vulnerabilities, affecting the CPUs in later generations of Apple A- and M-series chip sets, open them to side channel attacks, a class of exploit that infers secrets by measuring manifestations such as timing, sound, and power consumption. Both side channels are the result of the chips’ use of speculative execution, a performance optimization that improves speed by predicting the control flow the CPUs should take and following that path, rather than the instruction order in the program.The Apple silicon affected takes speculative execution in new directions.

At 4:52, the negative charge should be drawn on the carbon at the end of the chain, not on the second to last carbon. This also holds during the polymerization process (5:15), where the negative charge should move right to the end of the chain.

--

As of 2022, humans have deforested 17% of the Amazon, and scientists warn that we may be approaching a tipping point. It’s like removing bricks from a house: take a few and the house remains standing; remove too many and the whole thing will collapse. So, what would happen if the entire Amazon disappeared? Anna Rothschild explores the relationship between this ecosystem and the rest of the planet.

Lesson by Anna Rothschild, directed by Upamanyu Bhattacharyya, Otter Studios.

This has prompted comparisons to a famous archeological site where behavior is similarly well preserved: the site of Pompeii, a town crystallized by volcanic eruption almost 2000 years ago.  But when you look into the details, it turns out their residents may have experienced very different final moments.

But in many real-time systems, the server needs to talk first and more often.This is where  and  come into play—two popular methods for achieving real-time updates.In this article, we’ll explore these two techniques, how they work, their pros and cons, and use cases.HTTP, the backbone of the web, follows a :The client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to the server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.This model is simple and works for many use-cases, but it has limitations: With plain HTTP, the server cannot proactively push data to the client. The client has to request the data periodically. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone with no persistent connection to the server. This can be problematic if you need continuous exchange of data.To build truly real-time features—live chat, financial tickers, or gaming updates—you need a mechanism where the server can instantly notify the client when something changes. is a technique that mimics real-time behavior by keeping HTTP requests open until the server has data.Long Polling is an enhancement over traditional polling. In regular polling, the client repeatedly sends requests at fixed intervals (e.g., every second) to check for updates. This can be wasteful if no new data exists. Long Polling tweaks this approach: the client asks the server for data and then “waits” until the server has something new to return or until a timeout occurs.How Does Long Polling Work? to the server, expecting new data.Server holds the request open until it has an update or a timeout is reached.If there's new data, the server immediately responds.If there’s no new data and the timeout is reached, the server responds with an empty or minimal message.Once the client receives a response—new data or a timeout—it immediately sends a new request to the server to keep the connection loop going.Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP).Supported universally since it uses standard HTTP, and it works reliably through firewalls and proxies.Higher latency after each update (client must re-establish connection).Resource-heavy on servers (many open hanging requests).Simple chat or comment systems where real-time but slightly delayed updates (near real-time) are acceptable.Notification systems for less frequent updates (e.g., Gmail’s "new email" alert).Legacy systems where WebSockets aren’t feasible.Code Example (JavaScript) provide a full-duplex, persistent connection between the client and the server.Once established, both parties can send data to each other at any time, without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Client sends an HTTP request with .: If supported, the server upgrades the connection to WebSocket (switching from  to ). After the handshake, client and server keep a TCP socket open for communication.Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded, data can be exchanged bidirectionally in real time until either side closes the connection.Ultra-low latency (no repeated handshakes).Lower overhead since there’s only one persistent connection rather than repeated HTTP requests.Scalable for real-time applications that need to support large number of concurrent users.More complex setup (requires the client and server to support WebSocket).Some proxies and firewalls may not allow WebSocket traffic.Complexity in implementation and handling reconnections/errors.Server resource usage might grow if you have a large number of concurrent connections.Live chat and collaboration tools (Slack, Google Docs, etc.).Multiplayer online games with real-time state synchronization.Live sports/financial dashboards that need to push frequent updates.Code Example (JavaScript)Both methods achieve real-time updates, but your choice depends on your project’s requirements: is easier to implement using standard libraries. Any environment that supports HTTP can handle it, often without extra packages. require a bit more setup and a capable proxy environment (e.g., support in Nginx or HAProxy). However, many frameworks (e.g., Socket.io) simplify the process significantly.Scalability and Performance can become resource-intensive with a large number of simultaneous clients, due to multiple open connections waiting on the server side. offer a more efficient, persistent connection and scale better for heavy, frequent data streams. fits scenarios where data updates aren’t super frequent. If new data arrives every few seconds or minutes, long polling might be enough. are better for high-frequency updates or two-way communication (e.g., multiple participants editing a document or interacting in a game). typically works even in older networks or those with strict firewalls. might face issues in certain corporate or older mobile environments, though this is less of a problem as the standard becomes more widespread.While both achieve real-time communication, WebSockets are generally more efficient for truly real-time applications, while Long Polling can be simpler to implement for less demanding scenarios.1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)Allows the server to push messages to the client over HTTP.It's simpler than WebSockets for one-way communication, but not full-duplex.Best suited for use cases like news feeds, real-time notifications, and status updates.Commonly used in IoT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging.Specialized for device-to-device or device-to-server communication with minimal overhead.3. Libraries like Socket.ioProvides an abstraction over WebSockets for easier real-time communication.Automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets are unsupported.Ensures cross-browser compatibility with robust and reliable performance.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called "flexible use of capital receipts scheme" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million.
 
Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has "approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. "The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken," the council said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Flags Linux Topics As &apos;Cybersecurity Threats&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, "Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.
 
If you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that "multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed." However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: "Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers." 

UPDATE: Facebook has admited they made a mistake and stopped blocking the posts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Collaborated With The Nazis During WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZZBN2RIU0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FBZZBN2RIU0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 22:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World War 2 created many impossible decisions for the people who fell victim to this all-consuming war.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

"This bill aligns Michigan with a majority of the country," according to the state's announcement, which says the bill "advances technological literacy" and ensures their students "are well-equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary for success in the workforce." 
Slashdot reader theodp writes:



From the Michigan House Fiscal Agency Analysis: "Supporters of the bill say that increasing access to computer science courses for students in schools should be a priority of the state in order to ensure that students can compete for the types of jobs that have good pay and will be needed in the coming decades." 
That analysis goes on to report that testifying in favor of the bill were tech-giant backed nonprofit Code.org (Microsoft is a $30 million Code.org donor), Amazon and AWS (Amazon is a $30+ million Code.org donor), the tech-supported Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the lobbying organization TechNet, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and OpenAI). 
It's not clear how many high schools in Michigan are already teaching CS courses, but this still raises a popular question for discussion. Should high schools be required to teach at least one CS course?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Brings Some Systems Faster Suspend and Resume</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/25/2343225/linux-614-brings-some-systems-faster-suspend-and-resume?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amid the ongoing Linux 6.14 kernel development cycle, Phoronix spotted a pull request for ACPI updates which "will allow for faster suspend and resume cycles on some systems." 

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Does Ice Float?

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" — code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JRE MMA Show #165 with Jiri Prochazka</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lpfgsPUMCaM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe sits down with Jiří Procházka, a professional mixed martial artist currently competing in the Light Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

// Bio
Tomaz Levak, founder of OriginTrail, is active at the intersection of Cryptocurrency, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the core of OriginTrail is a pursuit of Verifiable Internet for AI, an inclusive framework addressing critical challenges of the world in an AI era. To achieve the goal of Verifiable Internet for AI, OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation ensures the provenance and verifiability of information while incentivizing the creation of high-quality knowledge. These advancements are pivotal to unlock the full potential of AI as they minimize the technology’s shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, issues of data ownership, and model collapse.

Tomaz's contributions to OriginTrail span over a decade and across multiple fields. He is involved in strategic technical innovations for OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and NeuroWeb blockchain and was among the authors of all three foundational White Paper documents that defined how OriginTrail technology addresses global challenges.

Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1l8YQuyjWks?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers say new attack could take down the European power grid</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/euripean-ripple-attack-flipper-zero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last month, researchers revealed a finding that’s likely to shock some people and confirm the low expectations of others: Renewable energy facilities throughout Central Europe use unencrypted radio signals to receive commands to feed or ditch power into or from the grid that serves some 450 million people throughout the continent.Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette stumbled on their discovery largely by accident while working on what they thought would be a much different sort of hacking project. After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of Project Blinkenlights?

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Steve Pagliuca Brought Bain’s Playbook to the Celtics | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyoWePXT50g</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NyoWePXT50g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with Steve Pagliuca to discuss his ownership principles for the Boston Celtics and Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") elif response.status_code == 401:     print("Error: Invalid API key") elif response.status_code == 404:     print("Error: City not found") else:     print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jennifer Burns: Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Economics, Capitalism, Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #457</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rz-4ulRKnz4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:27:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jennifer Burns is a historian of ideas, focusing on the evolution of economic, political, and social ideas in the United States in the 20th century.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

// Abstract
Qualcomm® AI Hub helps to optimize, validate, and deploy machine learning models on-device for vision, audio, and speech use cases.

With Qualcomm® AI Hub, you can:

Convert trained models from frameworks like PyTorch and ONNX for optimized on-device performance on Qualcomm® devices.
Profile models on-device to obtain detailed metrics including runtime, load time, and compute unit utilization.
Verify numerical correctness by performing on-device inference.
Easily deploy models using Qualcomm® AI Engine Direct, TensorFlow Lite, or ONNX Runtime.

The Qualcomm® AI Hub Models repository contains a collection of example models that use Qualcomm® AI Hub to optimize, validate, and deploy models on Qualcomm® devices.

Qualcomm® AI Hub automatically handles model translation from source framework to device runtime, applying hardware-aware optimizations, and performs physical performance/numerical validation. The system automatically provisions devices in the cloud for on-device profiling and inference. The following image shows the steps taken to analyze a model using Qualcomm® AI Hub.

// Bio

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

Dark matter has eluded us for many decades. Even our most advanced particle colliders and sophisticated underground detectors have come up short. But it may be that we can finally solve this mystery with a much simpler experiment, involving a ray of light, a good clock, and the planet Mars.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Romanovs: The Truth Behind The Downfall of the Russian Empire</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcS056KiJa0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hcS056KiJa0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For three hundred years Russia was ruled by one family: the Romanovs.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2585624665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages.

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.
