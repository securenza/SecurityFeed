(Specifically the Vice President said "There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns, allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise.") 

The article adds that TikTok owner ByteDance "has not publicly confirmed negotiations with any potential U.S. buyer, nor has it confirmed its willingness to sell TikTok to a U.S. bidder." But ByteDance "favors" a deal with Oracle, according to an X.com post on Thursday from tech-publication The Information. 

And today Politico adds that Oracle "is accelerating talks with the White House on a deal to run TikTok, though significant concerns remain about what role the app's Chinese founders will play in its ongoing U.S. operation, according to three people familiar with the discussions."

[Oracle's discussions are happening] amid ongoing warnings from congressional Republicans and other China hawks that any new ownership deal — if it keeps TikTok's underlying technology in Chinese hands — could be only a surface-level fix to the security concerns that led to last year's sweeping bipartisan ban of the app. Key lawmakers, including concerned Republicans, are bringing in Oracle this week to discuss the possible deal and rising national security concerns, according to four people familiar with the meetings. One of the three people familiar with the discussions with Oracle said the deal would essentially require the U.S. government to depend on Oracle to oversee the data of American users and ensure the Chinese government doesn't have a backdoor to it — a promise the person warned would be impossible to keep. 
"If the Oracle deal moves forward, you still have this [algorithm] controlled by the Chinese...." 

The data security company HaystackID, which serves as independent security inspectors for TikTok U.S., said in February that it has found no indications of internal or external malicious activity — nor has it identified any protected U.S. user data that has been shared with China.

We are now (to our knowledge) the fastest api-compatible zlib implementation for decompression, and beat the competition in the most important compression cases too.We've built a dashboard that shows the performance of the current main branch compared to other implementations, and tracks our performance over time to catch any regressions and visualize our progress.This post compares zlib-rs to the latest zlib-ng and, for decompression, also to zlib-chromium. These are the leading C zlib implementations that focus on performance. We'll soon write a blog post with more technical details, and only cover the most impactful changes briefly.Last time, we benchmarked using the  flag. That gave the best results for our implementation, but was not entirely fair because our rust implementation could assume that certain SIMD capabilities would be available, while zlib-ng had to check for them at runtime.We have now made some changes so that we can efficiently select the most optimal implementation at runtime too.Picking the best version of a function is known as multiversioning. We have a baseline implementation that works on all CPUs, and then some number of specialized versions that use SIMD instructions or other features that may or may not be available on a particular CPU. The challenge is to always pick the optimal implementation, but with minimal runtime cost. That means we want to do the runtime check as few times as possible, and then perform a large chunk of work.Today, multiversioning is not natively supported in rust. There are proposals for adding it (which we're very excited about!), but for now, we have to implement it manually which unfortunately involves some unsafe code. We'll write more about this soon (for the impatient, the relevant code is here).The C code is able to use  implicit fallthroughs to generate very efficient code. Rust does not have an equivalent of this mechanism, and this really slowed us down when data comes in in small chunks.Nikita Popov suggested we try the -Cllvm-args=-enable-dfa-jump-thread option, which recovers most of the performance here. It performs a kind of jump threading for deterministic finite automata, and our decompression logic matches this pattern.LLVM does not currently enable this flag by default, but that is the plan eventually. We're also looking into supporting this optimization in rustc itself, and making it more fine-grained than just blindly applying it to a whole project and hoping for the best.As far as we know, we're the fastest api-compatible zlib implementation today for decompression. Not only do we beat zlib-ng by a fair margin, we're also faster than the implementation used in chromium.Like before, our benchmark is decompressing a compressed version of silesia-small.tar, feeding the state machine the input in power-of-2 sized chunks. Small chunk sizes simulate the streaming use case, larger chunk sizes model cases where the full input is availabe.We're now significantly faster than zlib-ng for all but the smallest chunk size. A chunk size of  bytes is very unlikely to be relevant for performance in practice because the input can just be buffered and then decompressed in larger chunks.We are however significantly faster than zlib-ng at the more relevant chunk sizes: well over 10% for inputs of 1kb, and over 6% for inputs of 65kb.For decompression, the zlib implementation used in the chromium project (found here, which we use via a modified version of ) is often faster than zlib-ng. However, we also beat it at this benchmark for the most relevant chunk sizes.Interestingly, zlib-chromium is mostly faster for the smaller chunk sizes, while for larger chunk sizes performance is fairly comparable to zlib-ng.We've been chipping away at compression too (shoutout to Brian Pane, who contributed numerous PRs in this area), but see more mixed results.On x86_64 linux, we are faster for some of the compression levels that matter most, about 6% at the default level of 6, and over 10% at the "best compression" level 9. But we're still slightly slower for most of the other levels when comparing to zlib-ng.For most users, decompression is the most relevant operation, and even for compression we're a lot faster than stock zlib. Nevertheless, we'll continue to try and improve compression performance.zlib-rs can be used both in C projects and as a rust crate in rust projects. For rust projects, we recommend using the  release of the flate2 crate with the  feature flag. For use in C projects, zlib-rs can be built as a C dynamic library (see instructions) and used in any project that uses zlib today.Our implementation is mostly done, and clearly performs extremely well. However, we're missing some less commonly used API functions related to gzip files that would make us a complete drop-in replacement in all cases.To complete the work and improve performance and e.g. packaging, we're seeking funding for the amount of €95.000. See the workplan for details.Please contact us if you are interested in financially supporting zlib-rs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dead children among bodies pulled from well in Sudan after fighters withdraw from area</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fKD5xnxMsg</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8fKD5xnxMsg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 19:08:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sudanese authorities said Sunday many bodies have been found at the bottom of a well in the capital, Khartoum, a few days after the military cleared the area from a notorious paramilitary group.

It’s true. You can be productive with an LLM-assisted workflow, but that same workflow could also be making you dumber.There’s a reason behind why I say this. Over time, you develop a reliance on LLM tools. This is to the point where is starts to become hard for you to work without one.I got into software engineering because I love building things and figuring out how stuff works. That means that I enjoy partaking in the laborious process of pressing buttons on my keyboard to form blocks of code.LLM-assisted workflows take this away. Instead of the satisfaction of figuring out a problem by hand, one simply asks the LLM to take a guess.Instead of understanding why things work in the way they do, you become dependent on an assistant to tell you what you should do.Some people might not enjoy writing their own code. If that’s the case, as harsh as it may seem, I would say that they’re trying to work in a field that isn’t for them. Maybe you’re just here for the money? Fair enough. That happens with every profession, and it generally shows through one’s enthusiasm and demeanor.The best engineers I’ve met are people who will spend hours at the weekend building their own version of a tool or software. Heck, that’s where you get innovation and advancements from. You can’t find performance improvements without a good understanding of how a system works, otherwise you’re just shooting in the dark.There is a concept called “Copilot Lag”. It refers to a state where after each action, an engineer pauses, waiting for something to prompt them what to do next. There is no self-sufficiency, just the act of waiting for an AI to tell them what should come next. It’s akin to where a junior in the field might start - relying on their more senior colleagues to guide them and understand how to proceed.Eons ago, I used to use GitHub Copilot in VS Code. When I look back on that time period now, I’m amazed I didn’t do more damage to knowledge retention.Over time, I started to forget basic foundational elements of the languages I worked with. I started to forget parts of the syntax, how basic statements are used. It’s pretty embarrassing to look back and think about how I was eroding the knowledge I had gathered just because I wanted a short term speed increase.That’s the reality of what happens when you use Copilot for a year. You start to forget things, because you are no longer having to think about what you’re doing in the same way that you would when you try to figure out how to solve a problem yourself.It was actually a video by ThePrimeagen that made me realise this and confront reality. He had a clip from one of his streams where he was talking about Copilot lag. What a wake up call that was!I stopped using LLM assistants for coding after that, and I’m glad I did.To give an example, compilers are an area that I find super interesting. I had actually tried to work through Thorsten Ball’s Writing An Interpreter In Go at the time. But it was completely pointless. Instead of learning about the topics and techniques in the book, Copilot was just outputting the code for me. Sure, it might feel cool that you just wrote a parser, but could you do it again if you turned Copilot off? Probably not. You also lose the chance to learn about concepts like memory management or data oriented design, because Copilot just gives you some code that it thinks might work, instead of you researching topics and understanding nuances.That actually leads into another angle. Research. This time with a more positive spin on AI.It’s true. LLMs are useful. They’re like a search engine. We used to use stack overflow to get help with a programming problem. Since LLMs are trained on all that data, they can be effective tools to learn more about a concept. But only if you use them with an inquisitive mindset and don’t trust their output.As they’re notorious for making crap up because, well, that’s how LLMs work by design, it means that they’re probably making up nonsense half the time. It’s just about patterns and token sequences, not real statements by people that are insanely knowledgeable. It’s trained on content created by people who know what they’re talking about, but it regurgitates it in a manner that differs from the source material.Anyway, interrogating responses and trying to figure out why it's recommending certain approaches is the only real way to get benefits from an LLM. Treat it like a conversation with someone, where you’re trying to understand why they like a certain technique. If you don’t understand why something is being suggested, or what it’s actually doing under the hood, then you have failed.And make notes! Lots of them! I recently started playing around with Zig, and I constantly make notes on things that I am learning about the language, especially considering that it’s my first time dealing with memory management. They can be a useful reference point and handy when you’re stuck, or maybe even something to share with others!I wrote this post on my morning commute, and my Tube has arrived at its destination, so I’ll leave it here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ultimate Git Tutorial (Git 2.48)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1jcslub/the_ultimate_git_tutorial_git_248/</link><author>/u/jhcarl0814</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:50:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Violent tornadoes and storms tear through the US, leaving dozens dead | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiVPydRn7Bs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KiVPydRn7Bs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:40:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At least 32 people have been killed by violent storms and tornadoes across central and southern parts of the United States.

And the book's publisher Macmillan released a defiant statement that "The arbitration order has no impact on Macmillan... We will absolutely continue to support and promote it." (They added that they were "appalled by Meta's tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement.") 
Saturday the controversy was even covered by Rolling Stone:

[Whistleblower Sarah] Wynn-Williams is a diplomat, policy expert, and international lawyer, with previous roles including serving as the Chief Negotiator for the United Nations on biosafety liability, according to her bio on the World Economic Forum... 
Since the book's announcement, Meta has forcefully responded to the book's allegations in a statement... "Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment. Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work. Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books." 
But the negative coverage continues, with the Observer Sunday highlighting it as their Book of the Week. "This account of working life at Mark Zuckerberg's tech giant organisation describes a 'diabolical cult' able to swing elections and profit at the expense of the world's vulnerable..." 
Though ironically Wynn-Williams started their career with optimism about Facebook's role in the app internet.org.
. "Upon witnessing how the nascent Facebook kept Kiwis connected in the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, she believed that Mark Zuckerberg's company could make a difference — but in a good way — to social bonds, and that she could be part of that utopian project... 
What internet.org involves for countries that adopt it is a Facebook-controlled monopoly of access to the internet, whereby to get online at all you have to log in to a Facebook account. When the scales fall from Wynn-Williams's eyes she realises there is nothing morally worthwhile in Zuckerberg's initiative, nothing empowering to the most deprived of global citizens, but rather his tool involves "delivering a crap version of the internet to two-thirds of the world". But Facebook's impact in the developing world proves worse than crap. In Myanmar, as Wynn-Williams recounts at the end of the book, Facebook facilitated the military junta to post hate speech, thereby fomenting sexual violence and attempted genocide of the country's Muslim minority. "Myanmar," she writes with a lapsed believer's rue, "would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived." And what is true of Myanmar, you can't help but reflect, applies globally... 

"Myanmar is where Wynn-Williams thinks the 'carelessness' of Facebook is most egregious," writes the Sunday Times:

In 2018, UN human rights experts said Facebook had helped spread hate speech against Rohingya Muslims, about 25,000 of whom were slaughtered by the Burmese military and nationalists. Facebook is so ubiquitous in Myanmar, Wynn-Williams points out, that people think it is the entire internet. "It's no surprise that the worst outcome happened in the place that had the most extreme take-up of Facebook." Meta admits it was "too slow to act" on abuse in its Myanmar services.... 
After Wynn-Williams left Facebook, she worked on an international AI initiative, and says she wants the world to learn from the mistakes we made with social media, so that we fare better in the next technological revolution.

"Give us back the Statue of Liberty," centre-left politician Raphaël Glucksmann said at a convention of his Place Publique center-left movement."We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: 'Give us back the Statue of Liberty,'" he told cheering supporters. "We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home," he added.The Statue of Liberty was unveiled in New York City's harbour on October 28, 1886, for the centennial of the American Declaration of Independence as a gift from the French people to America. It was designed by Frenchman Auguste Bartholdi. Paris does have a far smaller copy of the statue on a small island on the Seine in Paris.Glucksmann, a staunch defender of Ukraine, has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's radical change of US policy on the war. He also took aim at Trump's cuts to US research institutions, which have already prompted a French government initiative to attract some of them to work in France."The second thing we're going to say to the Americans is: 'If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovation, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world's leading power, then we're going to welcome them,'" continued Glucksmann.Since Trump returned to the White House in January, his government has cut federal research funding and sought to dismiss hundreds of federal workers working on health and climate research.Glucksmann also criticized far-right leaders in France, accusing them of being a "fan club" for Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who is spearheading the president's efforts to cut spending.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ecuadorians worry river oil spill will affect their health and crops | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lpjAFPx1Q</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/p3lpjAFPx1Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:13:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Residents fear an oil spill in Ecuador’s Viche River will affect their health and crops.

	Computers used to be physical beasts.We programmed them by punching cards, plugging in wires, and flipping switches. Programmers walked among banks of switches and cables, physically choreographing their logic. Being on a computer used to be a full-body experience.
We've been successfully removing all friction from our apps — think about how effortless it is to scroll
	through a social feed. But is that what we want? Compare the feeling of doomscrolling to kneading
	dough, playing an instrument, sketching... these take effort, but they're also deeply
	satisfying. When you strip away too much friction, meaning and satisfaction go with it.
Think about how you use physical tools. Drawing isn't just moving your hand—it's the
	feel of the pencil against paper, the tiny adjustments of pressure, the sound of graphite
	scratching. You shift your body to reach the other side of the canvas. You erase with your other
	hand. You step back to see the whole picture.
We made painting feel like typing,Putting the you back in UISo how might our interfaces look if we shaped them to fit us?
We use our hands to sculpt, our eyes to scan, our ears to catch patterns.
	Our computers can communicate to us in many different formats, each with their own strengths:And what about the reverse! We can communicate to our computers in many different ways, each with their own strengths:
And the real magic happens when we combine different modalities. You can't read and listen and speak
	at the same time—try reading this excerpt while talking about your day:
If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole life would have been
		entirely different. She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s
		engagement picnic and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear
		what happened to her because of it.
	Let's build interfaces that let us multitask across senses.So, what might a richer interface look like? I have strong conviction that our future interfaces should:
let us collaborate on , not just ephemeral chat logs.support multiple concurrent modalities—voice, gestures,
		visuals, spatial components.
	respond to —detecting context, organizing information, helping
		us think better.
	Last year, I did a rough exploration of what this could look like for a thought organizing tool. One that listened as you talked or typed, and organized your rambling thoughts into cards.
This interface is very rough, but felt like a different way of working with technology. Especially how it let me bumble through rough ideas one second, then responded to commands like "re-group my cards" or "add 3 cards about this" the next.
I would love to see more explorations like this!
Our interfaces have lost their sensesAll day, we poke, swipe, and scroll through flat, silent
	screens. But we're more than just eyes and a pointer finger. We think with our hands, our ears,
	our bodies.
The future of computing is being designed right now. Can we build something richer—something that
	moves with us, speaks our language, and molds to our bodies?

So far, I'm getting somewhat comfortable with porting C console apps to Rust and using Rust in Web apps wherever it makes sense.That said, my bread and butter (as a self-employed software developer) is and always has been .NET and the Microsoft tech stack starting with C#. I make desktop apps and even in 2025 still target Windows 7 (for some projects).My clients are sometimes small government agencies, sometimes hobbyists looking to revive old equipment, and everything and everyone in between. I've written code for Windows drivers and I have a strong sense for that.I believe that Rust enables me to write better code. I'm getting to grips with new terminology and the greater Rust ecosystem, from packages and crates to handling parallelism. What I'm missing are more examples and resources.Where would I start transitioning my .NET desktop app development towards a Rust base? I don't need the code to produce native GUI elements, but I've yet to find a proper UI library for Windows that's built on Rust. Is this something I should pursue?Furthermore, it looks like there are very few Rust developers who are also mainly Windows developers, so I get the feeling I'm in a minority inside of a minority and that's OK. I'd just like to hear about others' experiences working in this space!Does Rust make sense, in your opinion, for what I'm seeking or should I give up and keep writing in C#, C/C++, and .NET?

I call these “wait, no, not like that” moments.When a passionate Wikipedian discovers their carefully researched article has been packaged into an e-book and sold on Amazon for someone else’s profit? .When a developer of an open source software project sees a multi-billion dollar tech company rely on their work without contributing anything back? When a nature photographer discovers their freely licensed wildlife photo was used in an NFT collection minted on an environmentally destructive blockchain? .And perhaps most recently, when a person who publishes their work under a free license discovers that work has been used by tech mega-giants to train extractive, exploitative large language models? These reactions are understandable. When we freely license our work, we do so in service of those goals: free and open access to knowledge and education. But when trillion dollar companies exploit that openness while giving nothing back, or when our work enables harmful or exploitative uses, it can feel like we've been naïve. The natural response is to try to regain control.This is where many creators find themselves today, particularly in response to AI training. But the solutions they're reaching for — more restrictive licenses, paywalls, or not publishing at all — risk destroying the very commons they originally set out to build. is an independent publication, entirely supported by readers like you. Consider signing up for a free or pay-what-you-want subscription — it really helps me to keep doing this work.The first impulse is often to try to tighten the licensing, maybe by switching away to something like the Creative Commons’ non-commercial (and thus, non-free) license. When NFTs enjoyed a moment of popularity in the early 2020s, some artists looked to Creative Commons in hopes that they might declare NFTs fundamentally incompatible with their free licenses (they didn’t). The same thing happened again with the explosion of generative AI companies training models on CC-licensed works, and some were disappointed to see the group take the stance that, not only do CC licenses not prohibit AI training wholesale, AI training should be considered non-infringing by default from a copyright perspective.But the trouble with trying to continually narrow the definitions of “free” is that it is impossible to write a license that will perfectly prohibit each possibility that makes a person go “wait, no, not like that” while retaining the benefits of free and open access. If that is truly what a creator wants, then they are likely better served by a traditional, all rights reserved model in which any prospective reuser must individually negotiate terms with them; but this undermines the purpose of free, and restricts permitted reuse only to those with the time, means, and bargaining power to negotiate on a case by case basis.Particularly with AI, there’s also no indication that tightening the license even . We already know that major AI companies have been training their models on all rights reserved works in their ongoing efforts to ingest as much data as possible. Such training may prove to have been permissible in US courts under fair use, and it’s probably best that it does.There’s also been an impulse by creators concerned about AI to dramatically limit how people can access their work. Some artists have decided it’s simply not worthwhile to maintain an online gallery of their work when that makes it easily accessible for AI training. Many have implemented restrictive content gates — paywalls, registration-walls, “are you a human”-walls, and similar — to try to fend off scrapers. This too closes off the commons, making it more challenging or expensive for those “every single human beings” described in open access manifestos to access the material that was originally intended to be common goods.Often by trying to wall off those considered to be bad actors, people wall off the very people they intended to give access to. People who gate their work behind paywalls likely didn’t set out to create works that only the wealthy could access. People who implement registration walls probably didn’t intend for their work to only be available to those willing to put up with the risk of incessant email spam after they relinquish their personal information. People who try to stave off bots with CAPTCHAs asking “are you a human?” probably didn’t mean to limit their material only to abled people who are willing to abide ever more protracted and irritating riddles. And people using any of these strategies likely didn’t want people to struggle to even find their work in the first place after the paywalls and regwalls and anti-bot mechanisms thwarted search engine indexers or social media previews.And frankly, if we want to create a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge, and where education, culture, and science are equitably shared as a means to benefit humanity, we should stop attempting to erect these walls. If a kid learns that carbon dioxide traps heat in Earth's atmosphere or how to calculate compound interest thanks to an editor’s work on a Wikipedia article, does it really matter if they learned it via ChatGPT or by asking Siri or from opening a browser and visiting Wikipedia.org?Instead of worrying about “wait, not like that”, I think we need to reframe the conversation to “wait, not  like that” or “wait, not in ways that threaten open access itself”. The true threat from AI models training on open access material is not that more people may access knowledge thanks to new modalities. It’s that those models may stifle Wikipedia and other free knowledge repositories, benefiting from the labor, money, and care that goes into supporting them while also bleeding them dry. It’s that trillion dollar companies become the sole arbiters of access to knowledge after subsuming the painstaking work of those who made knowledge free to all, killing those projects in the process.Irresponsible AI companies are already imposing huge loads on Wikimedia infrastructure, which is costly both from a pure bandwidth perspective, but also because it requires dedicated engineers to maintain and improve systems to handle the massive automated traffic. And AI companies that do not attribute their responses or otherwise provide any pointers back to Wikipedia prevent users from knowing where that material came from, and do not encourage those users to go visit Wikipedia, where they might then sign up as an editor, or donate after seeing a request for support. (This is most AI companies, by the way. Many AI “visionaries” seem perfectly content to promise that artificial superintelligence is just around the corner, but claim that attribution is somehow a permanently unsolvable problem.)And while I rely on Wikipedia as an example here, the same goes for any website containing freely licensed material, where scraping benefits AI companies at often extreme cost to the content hosts. This isn't just about strain on one individual project, it's about the systematic dismantling of the infrastructure that makes open knowledge possible.Anyone at an AI company who stops to think for half a second should be able to recognize they have a vampiric relationship with the commons. While they rely on these repositories for their sustenance, their adversarial and disrespectful relationships with creators reduce the incentives for anyone to make their work publicly available going forward (freely licensed or otherwise). They drain resources from maintainers of those common repositories often without any compensation. They reduce the visibility of the original sources, leaving people unaware that they can or should contribute towards maintaining such valuable projects. AI companies should want a thriving open access ecosystem, ensuring that the models they trained on Wikipedia in 2020 can be continually expanded and updated. Even if AI companies don’t care about the benefit to the common good, it shouldn’t be hard for them to understand that by bleeding these projects dry, they are destroying their own food supply.And yet many AI companies seem to give very little thought to this, seemingly looking only at the months in front of them rather than operating on years-long timescales. (Though perhaps anyone who has observed AI companies’ activities more generally will be unsurprised to see that they do not act as though they believe their businesses will be sustainable on the order of years.)It would be very wise for these companies to immediately begin prioritizing the ongoing health of the commons, so that they do not wind up strangling their golden goose. It would also be very wise for the rest of us to not rely on AI companies to suddenly, miraculously come to their senses or develop a conscience en masse.Instead, we must ensure that mechanisms are in place to  AI companies to engage with these repositories on their creators' terms.There are ways to do it: models like Wikimedia Enterprise, which welcomes AI companies to use Wikimedia-hosted data, but requires them to do so using paid, high-volume pipes to ensure that they do not clog up the system for everyone else and to make them financially support the extra load they’re placing on the project’s infrastructure. Creative Commons is experimenting with the idea of “preference signals” — a non-copyright-based model by which to communicate to AI companies and other entities the terms on which they may or may not reuse CC licensed work. Everyday people need to be given the tools — both legal and technical — to enforce their own preferences around how their works are used.Some might argue that if AI companies are already ignoring copyright and training on all-rights-reserved works, they'll simply ignore these mechanisms too. But there's a crucial difference: rather than relying on murky copyright claims or threatening to expand copyright in ways that would ultimately harm creators, we can establish clear legal frameworks around consent and compensation that build on existing labor and contract law. Just as unions have successfully negotiated terms of use, ethical engagement, and fair compensation in the past, collective bargaining can help establish enforceable agreements between AI companies, those freely licensing their works, and communities maintaining open knowledge repositories. These agreements would cover not just financial compensation for infrastructure costs, but also requirements around attribution, ethical use, and reinvestment in the commons.The future of free and open access isn't about saying “wait, not like that” — it’s about saying "yes, like that, but under fair terms”. With fair compensation for infrastructure costs. With attribution and avenues by which new people can discover and give back to the underlying commons. With deep respect for the communities that make the commons — and the tools that build off them — possible. Only then can we truly build that world where every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.As I was writing this piece, I discovered that a SXSW panel featuring delegates from the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons, titled “Openness Under Pressure: Navigating the Future of Open Access”, discussed some of the same topics. (I was, sadly, scheduled to speak at the same time and so was unable to attend in person). The audio recording is available online, and I would highly recommend giving it a listen if this is a topic that interests you!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LACT v0.7.2 released with RDNA4 support, Nvidia locked clocks and ROP count reporting</title><link>https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/v0.7.2</link><author>/u/Interject_</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 17:22:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Houthis condemn deadly US bombardment of Yemen as a &apos;war crime&apos; and promise retaliation | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJpKUJGIvSU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RJpKUJGIvSU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 17:21:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the US will continue its military campaign in Yemen until Houthi rebels no longer have the capacity to strike ships in the Red Sea.

But I never wrote down any development stories, and most of these projects, even as successful when released, got lost in time as years go by. That’s why I’m starting my new posts series „That time I” where I look back on my most interesting projects.The first one is about that time I recreated Photoshop in C++ and Windows API! I invite you to read my story and leave a comment with feedback, it’s hard to go on without your input 🙂Everything started in early summer of 2006. I was reading *a lot* of manga back then. But all the image reading apps sucked. Specifically, none of the apps allowed me to control my reading using just the mouse, and reaching my keyboard all the time was distracting. Since I just finished the C++/Windows API course at the uni, I spent the summer break coding my perfect manga reader. And I named it Fiew.Early autumn 2006 we returned to uni and had to decide on our final thesis for the degree. Writing the image viewer went smooth enough that I got the idea I could create an image editor as well. I was a heavy Adobe Photoshop user back then, so that became my goal. I mean, how hard can it be? Turns out, very.Over the course of the next several months, I wrote Advanced Image Editor named Fedit in C++ using Windows API and GDI+ graphic libraries. It followed a set of five rules to benefit the end user: no installers, no archives, no registry keys, no additional runtimes and a single executable file. The result was a program that was ready to work without the need of installation, could be run on systems with limited privileges (or straight from a thumb drive) and consumed small amounts of resources.I was very careful to make the interface look like classic Photoshop, and include all my most used features. So you had all the free floating windows with tools. The excellent colour picker. Easy layer management. Step-by-step reversible history. Several image filters, plus a matrix interface to encode your own pixel shifting filters too.Straight from my previous project named Fiew I added a massive image library viewer. It really could quickly and easily scroll through massive amounts of pictures.I had a lot of fun coding Fedit. And a lot of issues along the way. I spent a ton of time on MSDN and Stack Overflow, however that didn’t help that much since most of the issues were so specific I had to analyse and debug them on my own. But I worked like crazy on it, my motivation was immense. I had to make the bachelor thesis deadline, so for the final two-month stint I worked 14 hours a day.User interface was the most tricky bit. I wanted the workflow to resemble Photoshop as much as possible. The freely snapping-unsnapping of the tool settings pane was particularly hard. But no less than recreating the colour picker or the tool selector.By the time I finished I was pretty exhausted and kind of resenting WinAPI. But the thesis was a success and I received my Bachelor of Science in Engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology. Fedit received several positive reviews online but I didn’t promote it. Instead I took a well deserved holiday. A few months later thanks to the impression Fiew and Fedit made on the CTO of GoldenLine (Polish LinkedIn, market leader in its time, but now defunct), I landed a C++ job with a task to create extremely efficient WinAPI app to handle massive image uploading for a clone of Flickr. So in the end all that effort paid off.Fedit (and Fiew) source code is available on GitHub. The thesis documentation is available as PDF. The original website for these apps is still up on the Web Archive!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>tk9.0: v0.65.0 adds support for many more image formats</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jcpp3d/tk90_v0650_adds_support_for_many_more_image/</link><author>/u/0xjnml</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:45:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/0xjnml ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Startup Claims Its Upcoming (RISC-V ISA) Zeus GPU is 10X Faster Than Nvidia&apos;s RTX 5090</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/03/16/0221248/startup-claims-its-upcoming-risc-v-isa-zeus-gpu-is-10x-faster-than-nvidias-rtx-5090?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["The number of discrete GPU developers from the U.S. and Western Europe shrank to three companies in 2025," notes Tom's Hardware, "from around 10 in 2000." (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel...)
No company in the recent years — at least outside of China — was bold enough to engage into competition against these three contenders, so the very emergence of Bolt Graphics seems like a breakthrough. However, the major focuses of Bolt's Zeus are high-quality rendering for movie and scientific industries as well as high-performance supercomputer simulations. If Zeus delivers on its promises, it could establish itself as a serious alternative for scientific computing, path tracing, and offline rendering. But without strong software support, it risks struggling against dominant market leaders. 

This week the Sunnyvale, California-based startup introduced its Zeus GPU platform designed for gaming, rendering, and supercomputer simulations, according to the article. "The company says that its Zeus GPU not only supports features like upgradeable memory and built-in Ethernet interfaces, but it can also beat Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 by around 10 times in path tracing workloads, according to slide published by technology news site ServeTheHome."

 There is one catch: Zeus can only beat the RTX 5090 GPU in path tracing and FP64 compute workloads. It's not clear how well it will handle traditional rendering techniques, as that was less of a focus. In speaking with Bolt Graphics, the card does support rasterization, but there was less emphasis on that aspect of the GPU, and it may struggle to compete with the best graphics cards when it comes to gaming. And when it comes to data center options like Nvidia's Blackwell B200, it's an entirely different matter. 
Unlike GPUs from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia that rely on proprietary instruction set architectures, Bolt's Zeus relies on the open-source RISC-V ISA, according to the published slides. The Zeus core relies on an open-source out-of-order general-purpose RVA23 scalar core mated with FP64 ALUs and the RVV 1.0 (RISC-V Vector Extension Version 1.0) that can handle 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit data types as well as Bolt's additional proprietary extensions designed for acceleration of scientific workloads... Like many processors these days, Zeus relies on a multi-chiplet design... Unlike high-end GPUs that prioritize bandwidth, Bolt is evidently focusing on greater memory size to handle larger datasets for rendering and simulations. Also, built-in 400GbE and 800GbE ports to enable faster data transfer across networked GPUs indicates the data center focus of Zeus. 

High-quality rendering, real-time path tracing, and compute are key focus areas for Zeus. As a result, even the entry-level Zeus 1c26-32 offers significantly higher FP64 compute performance than Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 — up to 5 TFLOPS vs. 1.6 TFLOPS — and considerably higher path tracing performance: 77 Gigarays vs. 32 Gigarays. Zeus also features a larger on-chip cache than Nvidia's flagship — up to 128MB vs. 96MB — and lower power consumption of 120W vs. 575W, making it more efficient for simulations, path tracing, and offline rendering. However, the RTX 5090 dominates in AI workloads with its 105 FP16 TFLOPS and 1,637 INT8 TFLOPS compared to the 10 FP16 TFLOPS and 614 INT8 TFLOPS offered by a single-chiplet Zeus... 
The article emphasizes that Zeus "is only running in simulation right now... Bolt Graphics says that the first developer kits will be available in late 2025, with full production set for late 2026."

 In 2023 I tried out Codon. At the time I had difficulty compiling the scripts I most commonly used, but was excited by the prospect. Python is essentially single threaded and checks the shape (type) of each variable as it interprets scripts. Codon fixes types and compiles Python into compact, executable binaries that execute much faster. 

Several things have changed with their latest release: I have successful compiles, the committers have added a compiled version of NumPy (high performance math algorithms), and changed their open source license to Apache 2. 

"The other big news is that Exaloop, the company that is behind Codon, has changed their license to Apache 2..." according to the article, so "commercial use and derivations of Codon are now permitted without licensing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the hell do I make this Go program faster?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jcnqfi/how_the_hell_do_i_make_this_go_program_faster/</link><author>/u/yourpwnguy</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:18:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I’ve been messing around with a Go program that: Writes the sorted output to a new fileSeems so straightforward man :( Except it’s slow as hell.

And that alert reminds us that Medusa is a globe-spanning operation that recruits third-party affiliates to plant ransomware and negotiate with victims, notes the Register. "Even organizations that have good ransomware recovery regimes, meaning they don't need to unscramble encrypted data as they have good backups and fall-back plans, may consider paying to prevent the release of their stolen data, given the unpleasant consequences that follow information leaks.

Medusa actors also set a deadline for victims to pay ransoms and provide a countdown timer that makes it plain when stolen info will be sprayed across the internet. If victims cough up $10,000 in cryptocurrency, the crims push the deadline forward by 24 hours. 

The advisory reveals one Medusa actor has taken things a step further. "FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid," the advisory states. That separate actor then "requested half of the payment be made again to provide the 'true decryptor'," the advisory states, describing this incident as "potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme." 

The security groups' advisory stresses that they "do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations..." (But "Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents...) 

Besides updating software and operating systems, the alert makes these recommendations for organizations:

Require VPNs (or jump hosts) for remote network access
Block remote access from unknown/untrusted origins, and disable unused ports
 Segment networks to help prevent the spread of ransomware
Use a networking monitoring tool to spot and investigate abnormal activity — including lateral movement (using endpoint detection and response tools). Log all network traffic, and monitor it for unauthorized scanning and access attempts.
Create recovery plans with encrypted offline backups of sensitive/proprietary data and servers
Require multifactor authentication, use strong (and long) passwords, and "consider not requiring frequently recurring password changes, as these can weaken security." (Also audit access control following the principle of least privilege, and watch for new and/or unrecognized accounts.)

Today, I want to examine another concerning trend in the blockchain space, i.e., the growing disconnect between Web3 rhetoric and Web2 reality in corporate structures.The blockchain ethos promised to transform not just technology, but organizational structures themselves. Yet, walk into most "Web3" companies today, and you'll find a strikingly familiar scene, i.e., traditional hierarchies, centralized decision-making, and the same corporate playbooks that have defined business for decades.\
These organizations proudly display their Web3 credentials, i.e., blockchain integrations, token offerings, and decentralized applications, while operating with thoroughly Web2 corporate DNA. The contradiction is stark, companies building tools for trustless, intermediary-free interactions are themselves structured around trust hierarchies and intermediary layers of management.Decision-Making: Decentralized in Name OnlyWhile many Web3 projects implement token-based governance systems, the reality often falls short of true decentralization. Major decisions frequently originate from a small group of founders or developers who maintain privileged access to critical infrastructure. Governance tokens create an illusion of community control, but power concentrations through token distribution models ensure the scales remain tipped in favor of insiders.\
Even more concerning is how easily these governance mechanisms can be manipulated. When convenient, decisions are put to token-holder votes, when not, they're made behind closed doors under the guise of "technical necessities" or "emergency responses."Perhaps nowhere is the contradiction more evident than in hiring practices. Companies building technologies meant to transform trust, verification, and social coordination continue to rely on outdated, inefficient hiring rituals straight from the Web2 playbook.\
My response to interview invitations has become standardized:"We are in Web3, but your hiring process is still in Web2. In Web3, we adhere to cryptographic guarantees of our LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositories. If you want to hire me, do it, but don't try to take me on a Web2 wild goose chase interview process, just to tell me I am not a good fit for role."\
The traditional hiring process designed around information asymmetry and artificial scarcity makes little sense in a Web3 context. My work is publicly verifiable. My contributions to open-source projects provide cryptographically secured proof of my capabilities. My on-chain reputation and digital footprint offer more meaningful insights than any contrived interview scenario could hope to extract.\
Yet, these companies insist on subjecting candidates to outdated assessment methods, endless interview rounds, and arbitrary technical challenges that bear little resemblance to actual work requirements. It's as if they're building spaceships while insisting on hiring astronauts using horse-and-buggy evaluation techniques.The true promise of Web3 extends far beyond tokenization and distributed ledgers. It offers a fundamental rethinking of organizational structure, incentive alignment, and coordination mechanisms. When companies adopt blockchain technology without embracing its organizational implications, they miss the most transformative aspects of the paradigm.\
Genuinely Web3 native organizations would look radically different i.e. flatter hierarchies, transparent decision-making, contribution-based meritocracies, and permissionless participation. Hiring would focus on verifiable skills and community reputation rather than credentialism and performative interviews.\
Some DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have begun experimenting with these new models, but even there, old habits die hard. Many DAOs still maintain core teams with outsized influence, effectively recreating traditional power dynamics with a thin veneer of decentralization.Moving Forward: Authenticity in the Decentralized EraThe blockchain space faces a critical identity crisis. Will it truly transform organizational structures or merely apply new technology to old centralized models? The answer will determine whether Web3 represents a genuine paradigm shift or simply the next iteration of corporate re-branding.\
For organizations serious about embracing Web3 principles, change must go beyond technology. It requires rethinking governance from first principles, embracing radical transparency, and letting go of centralized control mechanisms, including hiring processes.\
As for me, I remain committed to working only with organizations whose actions match their decentralized rhetoric. My verifiable work speaks for itself. My proposals for micro-governance models offer a blueprint for genuinely decentralized coordination.\
In a space built on the principle that "code is law," perhaps it's time we acknowledged that corporate structure is also code, i.e., social code that determines how we organize, incentivize, and collaborate. Until Web3 companies rewrite this code, they remain Web2 entities playing dress-up in blockchain clothing.\
The disruption in decentralization that Bitcoin started cannot be completed until we extend its principles beyond technology to transform the very nature of how we organize and work together. Only then will Web3 fulfill its original promise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Photo calorie app Cal AI, downloaded over a million times, was built by two teenagers</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/photo-calorie-app-cal-ai-downloaded-over-a-million-times-was-built-by-two-teenagers/</link><author>Julie Bort</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cal AI has generated over 5 million downloads in 8 months, it says.

While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out—the hit on the Druzhba pipeline—creating international ripple effects beyond Russia’s borders as exports suddenly dropped.As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine’s strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia’s air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.What followed was Russia’s most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city’s largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disruptedExplosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force’s rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.The Druzhba pipeline—one of the world’s largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day—is a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, called it an attack on their sovereignty.When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia’s hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia’s nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia’s monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country’s electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.Ukraine’s strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?If Russia does not accept a ceasefire—at least in the air—Ukraine can exert much more pressure on Russia’s energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow’s main refinery, which supplies half the city’s energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia’s economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire—at least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine., we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.You could close this page.

It's incredible how social engineering tactics can still be so effective. Cybersecurity costs are projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually this year, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses. The , recently published by Crowdstrike, emphasized that social engineering tactics aimed at stealing credentials grew an astounding 442% in the second half of 2024, with Generative AI driving new adversary risks.\
What keeps the Organizations and Security experts up at night? The explosive rise of AI-powered attacks and next-level social engineering. While AI has strengthened security, it has also armed cybercriminals with sophisticated, elusive attack methods. Malicious actors aren't just adopting AI; they are weaponizing it against organizations and Individuals. This is the new frontier of cybersecurity—an arms race in which we're not just battling hackers but also AI-powered machines that can think, adapt, and innovate faster than ever before.The State of Cybersecurity in the Face of Increasing AI ThreatsToday, AI is used to generate realistic deepfakes, phishing emails, and social engineering attacks that deceive users into divulging sensitive information. Since early 2023, SCATTERED SPIDER has used social engineering techniques to gain access to single sign-on (SSO) accounts and cloud-based application suites. Multiple eCrime actors adopted this technique in 2024. Several relevant cases targeted academic and healthcare entities; in these incidents, threat actors subsequently used the compromised identity to exfiltrate data from cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) applications or modify employee payroll data.\
Academic research and a  found that the phishing click rate (54%) for AI-generated phishing emails was significantly higher than for human-written phishing messages (12%)\
The message is simple - More awareness is needed among the users and access mechanisms should be tightened.How the Evolution of AI Affects Enterprise Cybersecurity Traditional money scams often fail—silicon masks can't perfectly mimic human skin and movement. But AI-powered video deepfakes are changing the game. In February 2024, CNN reported that a finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into transferring  to fraudsters. The scammers used generative AI to create a  of the company’s CFO, fooling the employee during a live video call and persuading them to authorize the payment. In 2019, A UK-based energy company  after fraudsters used AI-generated audio to mimic the voice of the CEO’s Germany-based parent company. The fraudsters called the UK company's CEO, pretending to be the CEO of the parent company, and demanded an urgent wire transfer.Voice phishing, often known as vishing, uses live audio to build on the power of traditional phishing, where people are persuaded to give information that compromises their organization. One example is Help Desk Social Engineering where employees may reveal sensitive information to criminals.We're facing a dangerous reality. Imagine this: just a few seconds of your voice is all it takes for AI attackers to create a convincing clone. It's happening right now—criminals crafting audio snippets that sound exactly like your loved ones, crying for help in manufactured crises, or demanding urgent financial aid. These digital doppelgängers are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing.Picture this: cybercriminals wield AI to create convincing phishing emails that you might actually fall for them. These digital con artists are raising their game—they've even masqueraded as OpenAI itself, sending businesses seemingly legitimate urgent requests for payment information updates.How Can Organizations Detect and Prevent AI-Powered Cybersecurity Attacks?Let's take a look at some of the key Defense Strategies:Deploy AI models trained to detect fake content and phishing attempts. Tools powered with AI can also be used to detect, identify, and respond to more sophisticated social engineering tactics.Implement stronger authenticationImplement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, companies can evaluate ways to enhance their authentication process, taking into account voice cloning and deepfake technology that can potentially bypass audio/video-based authentication systems. To deal with Help Desk social engineering techniques, require a video authentication with Identification Proof for employees requesting password reset.\
Did you know traditional MFA solutions can still fall prey to social engineering? That's precisely why phishing-resistant MFA is so crucial—it creates a shield that neither sophisticated AI nor crafty human adversaries can talk their way through when targeting your authentication.Educate employees on recognizing AI-generated scams. Companies may consider hosting training to educate employees on social engineering that leverages AI, teaching individuals how to proceed cautiously in the face of increasingly convincing threat actor communications.Cultivate a security-first culture:Organizations must embed security across all operations and workflows, treating it as a priority instead of an afterthought. Consider whether current policies and procedures have a system in place to review and respond to reports of advanced social engineering and whether new methods must be implemented to account for increasingly sophisticated tactics.Make no mistake: social engineering attacks target your greatest vulnerability—human psychology—and AI has dramatically intensified this threat by enabling attackers to decode human behavior at an unprecedented scale. How do we fight back? Organizations can't rely on a single solution—they must implement a robust multi-layered approach: cutting-edge AI security tools working alongside human-centered training and well-crafted procedures. This defense-in-depth strategy is crucial for survival in today's landscape.\

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document snippets to improve responses. With , you can build a fully local, offline RAG system—no cloud services, no dependencies, and complete data privacy. While  supports both large and small LLMs, it is especially optimized for smaller models without sacrificing flexibility for larger ones.Introduction to RAG and In RAG, a knowledge store is queried to retrieve pertinent documents added to the LLM prompt. This helps ground the model’s output with factual, up-to-date data. Traditional RAG setups require multiple components (document loaders, text splitters, vector databases, etc.), but  streamlines the entire process with a single CLI tool. Document ingestion and chunking.Embedding generation via local models (using Ollama).Storage in a hybrid vector store that supports both semantic and textual queries.Querying to retrieve context and generate answers.\
This local-first approach ensures privacy, speed, and ease of management.Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing RAG with Ensure you have Ollama installed. Then, run:curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dontizi/rlama/main/install.sh | sh
\
Verify the installation:Index your documents by creating a RAG store (hybrid vector store):rlama rag <model> <rag-name> <folder-path>
\
For example, using a model like :rlama rag deepseek-r1:8b mydocs ./docs
Scans your specified folder (recursively) for supported files.Converts documents to plain text and splits them into chunks (default: moderate size with overlap).Generates embeddings for each chunk using the specified model.Stores chunks and metadata in a local hybrid vector store (in ).  rlama add-docs mydocs ./new_docs --exclude-ext=.log
  rlama list-chunks mydocs --document=filename
  rlama update-model mydocs <new-model>
4. Configuring Chunking and Retrieval Chunks are pieces of text (e.g. ~300-500 tokens) that enable precise retrieval. Smaller chunks yield higher precision; larger ones preserve context. Overlapping (about 10-20% of chunk size) ensures continuity. The  flag controls how many chunks are retrieved per query (default is 20). For concise queries, 5-10 chunks might be sufficient, while broader questions might require 30 or more. Ensure the total token count (chunks + query) stays within your LLM’s limit. While  primarily uses dense vector search, it stores the original text to support textual queries. This means you get both semantic matching and the ability to reference specific text snippets.Launch an interactive session:rlama run mydocs --context-size=20
\
In the session, type your question:> How do I install the project?
Converts your question into an embedding.Retrieves the top matching chunks from the hybrid store.Uses the local LLM (via Ollama) to generate an answer using the retrieved context.You can exit the session by typing .Start the API server for programmatic access:curl -X POST http://localhost:11249/rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "rag_name": "mydocs",
        "prompt": "How do I install the project?",
        "context_size": 20
      }'
\
The API returns a JSON response with the generated answer and diagnostic details.Recent Enhancements and TestsImproved Document Management: Replaces the traditional vector store. Supports both vector embeddings and textual queries. Quickly finds relevant documents based on user input. Now each document chunk includes a  field for extra context, enhancing retrieval accuracy.Hybrid Store Integration: All documents are now fully indexed and retrievable, resolving previous limitations.I compared the new version with v0.1.25 using  with the prompt:\
  "list me all the routers in the code"(as simple and general as possible to verify accurate retrieval)Published Version on GitHub:Answer: The code contains at least one router, , which is responsible for course-related routes. Additional routers for authentication and other functionalities may also exist.(Source: src/routes/coursRouter.ts) There are four routers: , , , and .(Source: src/routes/sgaRouter.ts)Adjust  to balance speed and accuracy.Use smaller models for faster embedding, or a dedicated embedding model if needed.Exclude irrelevant files during indexing to keep the index lean.Fine-tune chunk size and overlap. Moderate sizes (300-500 tokens) with 10-20% overlap work well.Use the best-suited model for your data; switch models easily with .Experiment with prompt tweaks if the LLM occasionally produces off-topic answers.Ensure your hardware (RAM/CPU/GPU) is sufficient for the chosen model.Leverage SSDs for faster storage and multithreading for improved inference.For batch queries, use the persistent API mode rather than restarting CLI sessions. Focus on enhancing the chunking process to achieve an optimal RAG, even when using small models. Continue testing with different models and configurations to find the best balance for your data and hardware. Stay tuned for upcoming hybrid retrieval enhancements and adaptive chunking features. simplifies building local RAG systems with a focus on confidentiality, performance, and ease of use. Whether you’re using a small LLM for quick responses or a larger one for in-depth analysis,  offers a powerful, flexible solution. With its enhanced hybrid store, improved document metadata, and upgraded RagSystem, it’s now even better at retrieving and presenting accurate answers from your data. Happy indexing and querying!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rescuers search the rubble after a building collapse in Latakia, Syria, kills at least 16 people</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-lsCocmbJM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0-lsCocmbJM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 12:47:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ordnance from Syria's 13-year conflict exploded in the coastal city of Latakia, collapsing a building and killing more than a dozen people, the Syrian Civil Defense said Sunday.

Oceans last year reached their highest levels in three decades — with the rate of global sea level rise increasing around 35% higher than expected, according to a NASA-led analysis published Thursday... Last year's rate of average global sea level rise was 0.23 inches per year, higher than the expected 0.17 inches per year, NASA said in a news release. 

The rate of global sea level rise follows a trend of rapidly increasing rates over the past 30 years. From 1993 to 2023, the rate of global sea level rise doubled, increasing from 0.08 inches per year to 0.18 inches, another NASA-led study showed. Overall, the global sea level has climbed by 4 inches since 1993. 

More details from ABC News:

 Climate change was a major driver to an unexpected level of sea level rise in 2024, according to a new NASA analysis... The majority of the difference between predicted and actual sea level rise was attributed to thermal expansion — or the ocean waters expanding as they warm, researchers said. An unusual amount of ocean warming, combined with meltwater from land-based ice such as glaciers, led to the increase of sea level rise last year, according to NASA. 

About two-thirds of sea level rise in recent years has resulted from the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, with a third coming from thermal expansion, according to NASA. In 2024, those metrics flipped, with two-thirds of the rise attributed to expanding ocean water and one-third attributed to contributions from melting ice. "With 2024 as the warmest year on record, Earth's expanding oceans are following suit, reaching their highest levels in three decades," said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, head of physical oceanography programs and the Integrated Earth System Observatory at NASA... Human-amplified climate change is the primary cause for present-day rising sea levels, climate research shows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>K-Pop group MISAMO members throw first pitch at Dodgers vs Tigers game in Tokyo</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55J7v3WV-4s</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/55J7v3WV-4s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 11:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[K-Pop group MISAMO added some glamour to the start of the Los Angeles' Dodgers second exhibition game in Tokyo.

Git 2.49 is out today as the latest feature update for this widely-used distributed version control system.
Git 2.49 delivers faster packing via name-hash v2, a new "git backfill" tool to address any missing historical blobs, "git clone" learned to make a shallow clone for a single commit that is not necessarily at the tip of any branch, lazy-loading missing files in a blobless clone, zlib-ng support preparations, and a foreign language interface for Rust has been added to the codebase.
This first bit of Rust code within Git introduces two new Rust crates: libgit-sys and libgit. Further work on Rust code within Git is being carried out for future Git releases.

That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement. In the last parliamentary elections in 2022, a united front of anti-Fidesz candidates fell well short of Orbán’s party, which won over half of the popular vote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI is Learning to Read DNA and Sound</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-ai-is-learning-to-read-dna-and-sound?source=rss</link><author>Rendering Technology Breakthroughs</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ sequence length warmup for these pretraining experiments.

Drawing from my decade of experience building web applications with Laravel, I've found that good old session-based authentication remains the most convenient and secure way to authenticate users. It strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and security, making it an approach I trust for building reliable web apps.The idea behind session-based authentication is simple:Client                                    Server
  |                                          |
  |   User visits the web app              |
  |----------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |   Server creates a session  sends   |
  |     its  back                          |
  | <--------------------------------------- |
  |                                          |
  |   User submits login form              |
  |----------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |   Server verifies credentials and      |
  |     stores the user identifier in the    |
  |     session                              |
  |                                          |
  |   Server sends a success response      |
  | <----------------------------------------|
  |                                          |
  |   Client makes authenticated requests  |
  |     (Cookie is automatically sent)       |
  |----------------------------------------> |
  |                                          |
  |   Server retrieves session data     |
  |     extracts the user identifier         |
  |                                          |
  |   Server processes request          |
  |     responds                             |
  | <----------------------------------------|When a session is first created, before the visitor submits the login form, it is known as an . At this stage, the session is not yet linked to a specific user, but it can still store temporary data that enhances the user experience.For example, in an e-commerce application, an unauthenticated session can store items added to a shopping cart before the user logs in. In a blog or forum, an unauthenticated session might be used to save a visitor’s draft comments before they sign up. In general, unauthenticated sessions can be used to store flash messages, such as "Item added to cart" or "Invalid login credentials".Once the login form is submitted and the user's identity is verified, storing the user identifier in the session converts it into an . Each time the client sends the cookie containing the session ID, the server uses it to identify the associated user and tailor the response accordingly.The first step in implementing an authentication mechanism in our web application is to enable user registration. During this process, a user typically provides an email or username along with a password. The server then performs input sanitization and various validation checks to ensure the credentials are secure, properly formatted, and unique.Once these checks are passed, the server securely stores the user’s credentials, often hashing the password using a strong algorithm like  or  before saving it to the database.Since the scope of this articles covers only the authentication part, we'll skip input validation and sanitization and focus on hashing the password and storing it in a database: (
	
)

(
    sql., 
    , 
    ,
)  {
	, .(
		[](),
		.,
	)
	 {
		
	}

	
}The first step in our  method is to generate a secure hash for the provided password using the  package. This is a crucial security measure that helps protect user credentials in case the database is ever compromised. Hashing passwords ensures that even if an attacker, or a rogue employee, gains access to the database, they cannot easily retrieve the original password.The  algorithm includes a cost factor, which controls how computationally expensive it is to hash a password and verify it later. A higher cost factor increases security by making brute-force attacks more difficult, but it also slows down the hashing process.In our example, we use the default cost of 10, which strikes a good balance between security and performance. Popular frameworks, such as Laravel, set the default cost to 12 for added protection.Next, we'll store the  along with the  in the database:,  bcrypt.()



_, .(
    ,
    ,
    ,
)
 {
    
}With this in place, we now have a record in the database that allows us to verify user credentials when they attempt to log in.For session-based authentication, the login process consists of two key steps:Verify that the user exists and the provided password matches the stored hash.Store the authenticated user's information in the session to maintain their logged-in state.In the first step, we retrieve the user record from the database using the provided username and compare the given password with its hashed version. We do that in a  function:(
	sql.,
	,
	,
)  {
	.(
		,
		,
	).()
	 {
		.(, )
	}

	.(
		[](),
		[](),
	)
	 {
		.(, )
	}

    
}The bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword function allows us to verify whether a given plain-text password () matches a bcrypt-hashed password (). Since the bcrypt algorithm generates a unique salt for each hash, hashing the same password multiple times will always produce different results. This means we cannot simply hash the plain password and compare it directly to the stored hash in a database query. Instead,  extracts the salt from the stored hash and uses it to perform the comparison securely.Next, for storing the user in the session, we will add a  function:(
	http.,
	,
	,
)  {
	()

	.()
	 {
		.(, )
	}

	.(, )

	
}The  function takes in the request, the session manager, and the username. It retrieves the session from the request using the  function (which we covered in a previous article), then migrates the session by deleting the existing session from the session store, assigning a new session ID, and generating a fresh CSRF token. Finally, it stores the username in the session to maintain the user's authenticated state.Generating a new session ID when a user's privilege level changes is crucial for protecting against session fixation attacks. Without this step, an attacker could inject a known session ID into the user's session cookie before they authenticate, and then reuse this session ID after the user logs in. This would grant the attacker unauthorized access to the user's account.The  method looks like this: () ()  {
	..(.)
	 {
		
	}

	.()
	.(, ())

	
}As you can see, the old session is deleted while the in-memory session instance gets a new session ID and .Before sending the response, the session manager's middleware will include the new session ID in the response, and store the session as a new entry in our session store. For a deeper dive into how this works, refer to the earlier article.To log a user out, we must migrate the session and remove the  from the session data:(
	http.,
	,
)  {
	()

	.()
	 {
		.(, )
	}

	.(, )

	
}By migrating the session, we ensure that the existing authenticated session is removed from the session store and a new one is created with the same session data. In the  function, we remove the  from the session to effectively convert it into an unauthenticated session. If any other critical information is stored in the session, it should also be removed. However, keeping non-critical session data, such as user preferences or timezone settings, can help provide a smooth user experience.Authentication MiddlewareNow, we’ll add middleware to protect handlers from unauthenticated access. Within the middleware, we’ll query the database to verify that the username stored in the session exists, ensuring the session belongs to a valid user:(sql.,  http.) http. {
	.(( http., http.) {
		()

		.().()
		 {
			.(, , .)
			
		}

		.(
			,
			,
		).()
		 {
			.(, , .)
			
		}

		 {
			.(, , .)
			
		}
	})
}As you might have guessed, this middleware must run after the session has been added to the request. In other words, the session manager's middleware must execute before the authentication middleware. Otherwise, the authentication middleware will panic when calling the  function, as it expects the session to be present in the request context.(http.)  {
	, .().({}).()
	 {
		()
	}

	
}In our middleware, we respond with a  error if authentication fails. Alternatively, you could choose to redirect the user to a  page, allowing them to enter their credentials and start a new authenticated session.Preventing Timing AttacksWhen handling login requests, it's best practice to ensure the authentication process takes a constant amount of time, regardless of whether the credentials are correct or not. This helps prevent timing attacks, which is a type of attacks where an attacker measures the time it takes for the server to respond and uses that information to infer sensitive data, such as valid usernames or partial password matches.To protect against timing attacks, we'll start a timer at the beginning of our handler and invoke a  call to ensure the handler responds exactly after a certain duration:.(, ( http., http.) {
    ..()

    .(
        ,
        .(),
        .(),
    )
     {
        .(, , .())
    }

    .().()  {
        .(.().())
    }

     {
        .(, , .)
        
    }

    .(, , , .)
})Here, we set the handler's duration to 1 second, but you can adjust this based on your application's performance needs and the desired user experience. Next, we call the  function to check if the provided credentials are valid. If they are, we proceed with the  function.Before returning either a success or failure response, we measure the elapsed time and call  if it’s less than 1 second, ensuring a consistent response time to mitigate timing attacks.By storing the authenticated user identifier in the session, we can easily differentiate between authenticated and non-authenticated sessions. This allows us to retrieve user information at any point during the request lifecycle, ensuring that we can verify and tailor responses based on the user's authentication status.The process is simple: we begin by extracting the session from the request, and then check the username session attribute:()

.().()
 {
    
}  {
    
}If the username exists, it indicates that the session is authenticated, and we can proceed to access relevant user data. If not, we know that the session is not authenticated, and we can prompt the user to log in.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Gunyah Hypervisor Software - Supporting Protected VMs in Android Virtualization Framework&quot; by Elliot Berman and &quot;Co-written with Prakruthi Deepak Heragu&quot; (January 28, 2024)</title><link>https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/01/gunyah-hypervisor-software-supporting-protected-vms-android-virtualization-framework</link><author>/u/throwaway16830261</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:35:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A work by Ben Jennings for The i Paper</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jcgv2h/a_work_by_ben_jennings_for_the_i_paper/</link><author>/u/CorleoneBaloney</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:19:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s 200% Tariff on EU Wine, Alcohol: What Happens If It Goes Ahead?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlYX0VonjOQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XlYX0VonjOQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 08:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on EU alcohol imports would send some companies out of business, according to Ignacio Sanchez Recarte, Secretary General of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins, CEEV, which represents European wine companies.

The highway will ease traffic into the city, which will host over 50,000 people at the conference this November:
The state government touts the highway's "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact... Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side — a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém. 

Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area... The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife... 

The state government of Pará had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns. Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit. 
But on the bright side, Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, said the highway would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, as well as climate-friendly bike lanes and solar-powered lighting...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NASA’s stuck astronauts welcome their replacements to the space station</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBlKola5A40</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OBlKola5A40?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:30:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just over a day after blasting off, a SpaceX crew capsule arrived at the International Space Station on Sunday, delivering the replacements for NASA’s two stuck astronauts.

Even OpenAPI has them, the de-facto standard and language-agnostic way to define HTTP APIs using JSON. So even if the programming language you're using doesn't natively support sum types, you may still need to handle a JSON payload over the wire that is modeled as one. This requires deciding how to decode that payload in your language of choice.Personal feelings about sum types aside, I think most people would agree they effectively model data structures that can be "one of these (potentially very different) things, and nothing else". And once you've experienced sum types with a  or match expression combined with , it's hard to go back.Let's take a primitive type, a boolean or  in Rust. It has 2 possible values:  or  (also called "cardinality"). A struct or record is called a  because you can count the number of possible values (or cardinality) by  the number of possible values of each field. So if I have a struct with 2 boolean fields (example here in Rust):
    signed_up
    subscribedThe number of possible values for this struct (or "product type") is: 2x2 = .Now I didn't choose this struct example completely at random. Some of the possible values are not valid in this particular domain: a user can't be  if they are not  as well. You'll also hear the phrase "make illegal states unrepresentable" when talking about sum types.A  is called that way because... you guessed it. You can count the number of possible values (or cardinality) by  the number of possible values of each branch. So if I have the following sum type (example still in Rust, where they are called "enums"): subscribedThe number of possible values for this "sum type" is: 1+2 = .I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to discuss and decide which of these two data structures is better adapted for representing this particular domain.My first nil pointer panic in Go was due to lack of sum typesOk, that section title is a bit cheeky and probably not entirely true. But when I figured out what caused the panic in my code, the thought "sum types would've caught this at compile time"  cross my mind. I'm sure the astute reader could find better ways to structure my first implementation, even without sum types. But humor me for the sake of this article.Let me say it now: This is  one of those "Go should have sum types" post. A lot has already been written on the topic and I don't want to get into the debate (although you'll probably guess where I stand). Let's just assume I want to  something like sum types in Go, then:How do I do so without straying too far from what's idiomatic in the language?How do I encode and decode it, to and from JSON, with the structure we'll see below?This post is also  a criticism of Go. I came across this issue in my first Go project, and I actually enjoyed working with the language. Having shied away from Go for a while (notably because of lack of sum types), I finally gave it a try because it seemed a good fit for this project. The fast compile times, robust standard library, simplicity of the language, and great developer tooling all delivered on their promise.For the anecdote, the first time I ran  was on the sample codebase from Alex Edward's "Let's Go Further" book (excellent book by the way), and I had to run it again because it was so much faster than what I was used to ( Haskell ), I thought nothing had happened.Back to the historical context: I'm feeling very productive with Go on this particular project. The feedback loop is amazing, and I have a working proof-of-concept in just a couple of days. Code seems to just slip from my fingers, everything works on the first try, zero values and pointers do not scare me anymore, I just need to add this last thing and... then it hits me:2024/12/07 12:16:53 http: panic serving [::1]:60984:

    /Users/nicolashery/dev/example/main.go:157 +0x20c
[...]Ouch. Having done a lot of Haskell and (strict) TypeScript recently, I had forgotten one could get such runtime errors. But I don't panic (pun intended), and I carefully look at the code mentioned in the stack trace.Below is a simplified version of the code for the sake of this article (the actual implementation had bigger structures and more cases). Can you spot the error? You have 5 seconds.a Action result  aType  ActionType_CreateObject
		result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_UpdateObject
		result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_DeleteObject
		result  fmt aObjectID ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		result  result
Ok, obviously you'll want to  on  to see what it is: Action 
	Type   ActionType 
	Object Object    
	ID     object Object Action  Action
		Type   ActionType_CreateObject
		Object objectobject Object Action  Action
		Type   ActionType_UpdateObject
		Object objectid  Action  Action
		Type ActionType_DeleteObject
		IDid Action  Action
		Type ActionType_DeleteAllObjectsDid you see the error? If yes, then you can stop reading now and get back to work. I'm joking. Didn't see it in the allowed time limit? Don't worry, the Go type checker couldn't either.Decoding JSON sum types in Go, take oneHow did I get to the code above, you might wonder? Well, imagine our service is receiving a JSON payload that looks like this:These are all different types of "actions", and this JSON representation is not unreasonable. The OpenAPI specification has a discriminator "pet" example, and the Redocly documentation a "vehicle" example, that are similar to this. (I have yet to come across an API with pets so apologies my example will be the less fun, but maybe more realistic.)My naive attempt to decode this JSON, because I was in a rush (and maybe also because Copilot suggested it, if I'm being honest), was to create a struct which I call . This is a struct with all possible fields for every action type merged, and using pointers. The zero-value of pointers is  which will be set for fields that are "unused" by a particular action type. Here it is in all its glory: Action 
	Type   ActionType 
	Object Object    
	ID      ActionType 
	ActionType_CreateObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_UpdateObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_DeleteObject     ActionType 
	ActionType_DeleteAllObjects ActionType This works because  doesn't care if there are missing fields in the JSON payload, it will just set the zero-value for them:actions Action err  jsondataactions err  err
We can also go the other way and call  to encode the struct into the same JSON representation as the snippet above. The  struct tag option will remove fields unused by each action type from the resulting JSON.So we're off to the races, what can go wrong with a bag of pointers? Subtle bugs when trying to access a field that is  because unused by that action type, that's what: aType  ActionType_CreateObject
	result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_UpdateObject
	result  fmt aObjectType aObjectID aObjectName ActionType_DeleteObject
	result  fmt aObjectID ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
	result How do OpenAPI and Protobuf handle this?I pick myself up after this runtime panic, and have the following genius idea: There are code generators for OpenAPI, if I give them the specification for the JSON discriminated union above, what do they output for Go? Also, Protocol Buffers is a popular wire format that is based on code generation, and the Oneof field looks a lot like a sum type, so what do  generate for Go?The OpenAPI schema for an action would look like this: object
   type
     object
   string
    If I feed this to the OpenAPI Generator (note that I'm using the useOneOfDiscriminatorLookup=true option for better output), I get what I'll call a "bag of all the branches": Action 
	createObject     CreateObject
	updateObject     UpdateObject
	deleteObject     DeleteObject
	deleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjects
 CreateObject 
	Object Object It generates an  method for  that:first decodes the JSON to check the  field (this is thanks to the useOneOfDiscriminatorLookup=true codegen option)according to the value of , it chooses the appropriate branch and decodes the JSON using the corresponding struct (, , etc.)Edited for clarity, it looks something like this:a Actiondata  tagged 
		Type ActionType  err  jsondatatagged err  err
	 err  taggedType  ActionType_CreateObject
		err  jsondataacreateObject ActionType_UpdateObject
		err  jsondataaupdateObject ActionType_DeleteObject
		err  jsondataadeleteObject ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		err  jsondataadeleteAllObjectsTo get the actual underlying value, the generator creates a method (which I'll name  here) that returns the first non-nil pointer:a Action any  acreateObject  acreateObject
	 aupdateObject  aupdateObject
	 adeleteObject  adeleteObject
	 adeleteAllObjects  adeleteAllObjects
	So this is already a big improvement on my  approach. Since the accessor method to the underlying value returns , I'm now checking the  which can be one of the more precise structs (, , etc.):action Action result  v  actionCreateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameUpdateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameDeleteObject
		result  fmt vIDDeleteAllObjects
		result  result
Some issues remain though:I "trust" the  return value of the accessor method to be one of the action structs (, , etc.) and nothing elseIf I add a "branch" (i.e. another action type), I can easily forget to update the  statement in Another generator that I tried out, oapi-codegen, uses a slightly different approach. It holds on to a  and delays the decoding until we call an equivalent of the  accessor method: Action 
	union jsonRawMessage
 CreateObject 
	Type   
	Object Object a Actionany errThe decoding works essentially the same, first decode enough to check the  field, then according to its value unmarshal into one of the action structs (, , etc.). The  documentation actually has a similar example.Since delaying JSON decoding wasn't particularly useful in my case, I didn't choose this route. But I wanted to mention it for completeness' sake.What about  (aka "Protobuf")? I found the following particularly interesting in their Go generated code guide:For a oneof field, the protobuf compiler generates a single field with an interface type . It also generates a struct for each of the singular fields within the oneof. These all implement this  interface.Let's try it out. Even though we're working with a JSON API, a Protobuf definition for our data model could look like this: value  create_object  update_object  delete_object  delete_all_objects  object The generated code indeed creates an interface  with a single method, as well as an  struct that holds a field with that interface type: Action 
	Value isAction_Value  isAction_Value  Action_CreateObject 
	CreateObject CreateObject Action_CreateObjectNow these two code generators, OpenAPI and Protobuf, will be the inspiration for my second attempt at decoding the JSON sum type in a more type-safe way...Decoding JSON sum types in Go, take twoAfter a bit of searching on the topic of "Go sum types", I stumbled across this: go-check-sumtype. From the README:A typical proxy for representing sum types in Go is to use an interface with an unexported method and define each variant of the sum type in the same package to satisfy said interface. This guarantees that the set of types that satisfy the interface is closed at compile time.This "interface with an unexported method" (also called "sealed interface", or "marker interface") sounded like a reasonable way to do it. And it's also what the Protobuf codegen seems to be using.I replaced my single "bag of all the fields"  struct with a sealed interface  and a struct for each variant (, , etc.). Each variant struct implements the interface: IsAction  CreateObject 
	Object Object CreateObject UpdateObject 
	Object Object UpdateObject DeleteObject 
	ID DeleteObject DeleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjectsNow I am quite pleased. Not only do these action-specific structs provide more type-safety, but if I forget to handle a variant in my  statement (or if I add a new one that implements the sealed interface), the  linter will catch it instead of getting an error at runtime!action Action result  v  actionCreateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameUpdateObject
		result  fmt vObjectType vObjectID vObjectNameDeleteObject
		result  fmt vIDDeleteAllObjects
		result  result
I still needed to figure out how to decode the JSON sum types payload into this interface and structs. You can't unmarshal into an interface value directly, you need to pass a concrete type. So I created a wrapper struct like so: Action 
	value IsAction
I also found the exhaustive linter, so why stop at sum types when you can also have enums! I defined one for action types, which are used as "tags" in my tagged union, along with the proper methods for JSON and string representations: ActionType 
	ActionType_CreateObject ActionType 
	ActionType_UpdateObject
	ActionType_DeleteObject
	ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
t ActionTypet ActionTypedata t ActionTypeI then defined  for my  wrapper struct like so:a Actiondata  tag 
		Type ActionType  err  jsondatatag err  err
	 v IsAction
	 tagType  ActionType_CreateObject
		v CreateObject ActionType_UpdateObject
		v UpdateObject ActionType_DeleteObject
		v DeleteObject ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
		v DeleteAllObjects err  jsondata v err  err
	

	avalue  v
	This works similarly to what we saw in the OpenAPI generated code:first decode only what is needed in the JSON to check the  fieldsecond, according to the value of , choose the appropriate variant struct of the sum type (, , etc.) and use it to decode the JSON payloadFor the other way around, I also defined  for the wrapper struct:a Action
	v  avalue

	data err  jsonv err  err
	 tagged any
	 err  jsondatatagged err  err
	 vCreateObject
		tagged ActionType_CreateObject
	UpdateObject
		tagged ActionType_UpdateObject
	DeleteObject
		tagged ActionType_DeleteObject
	DeleteAllObjects
		tagged ActionType_DeleteAllObjects
	 jsontaggedfirst encode the wrapped interface as JSON (unlike decoding, we can do this because the interface here will be initialized with an underlying concrete type: , , etc.)second, to add the tag in the  field, we do a roundtrip: decode into a , add the tag to that map, and re-encode the map into JSONNotice that I use the  linter in  to make sure I handle all possible tags, and I use the  linter in  to make sure I handle all possible variant structs. So given I keep the "enum" and "sum type" up-to-date, I will have exhaustiveness checking in both these methods (in addition to other methods or functions, such as  we saw earlier).That's it! Yes, there is a bit of boilerplate, but if one is using Go they are probably already OK with a little boilerplate here and there. Also, between AI coding assistants and other codegen tools, the cost of boilerplate can be mitigated. And finally there is that thing we say, "code is read (and maintained) much more often than written"? So I'd argue the added type-safety and the fact that we catch issues at compile time instead of runtime may be worth the tradeoff.Alternative implementationsOf course, the implementation described above is only  of decoding JSON sum types in Go. Below are a couple alternatives, some of which we've already mentioned. Action 
	createObject     CreateObject
	updateObject     UpdateObject
	deleteObject     DeleteObject
	deleteAllObjects DeleteAllObjects
 Action 
	payload jsonRawMessage
With the "sealed interface" approach I ended up using, I also considered an implementation of  that doesn't require an encode/decode roundtrip to add the tag, at the cost of a bit more boilerplate. It uses struct embedding instead (full example here):a Action data  err  v  avalueCreateObject
		tagged 
			Type ActionType 
			CreateObject
		
			Type         ActionType_CreateObject

Finally, it is worth mentioning that there are different ways to represent sum types in JSON, notably: (the one used in this article): {"type": "delete_object", "id": "1", "soft_delete": true}: {"type": "delete_object", "value": {"id": "1", "soft_delete": true}}: {"delete_object": {"id": "1", "soft_delete": true}}The naming is taken from the Rust library Serde's documentation, which provides a good explanation and examples for each representation.All JSON representations are possible with the Go implementation of sum types described in this post (you can find the adjacently tagged full example here).What Go could have been: V lang?I'll let the project's website do its own marketing:V is very similar to Go. If you know Go, you already know ≈80% of V.[...] V is very similar to Go, and its domain is similar to Rust's [...]Wait... The simplicity of Go, but with enums and sum types? Yes, please!I tried porting my example to V, and I have to admit it works out quite nicely (full source here):
	user
	group

	id   
	name 
	object Object

	object Object

	id  CreateObject  UpdateObject  DeleteObject  DeleteAllObjects

action Action action 
		CreateObject 
		UpdateObject 
		DeleteObject 
		DeleteAllObjects The  expression has exhaustiveness checking, of course. And the  sum type decodes from/encodes to JSON right out-of-the box (with the caveat that, at the time of writing, it uses the adjacently tagged representation with no way of configuring it).Before getting too excited it is worth noting that V is very much a niche language, and can't be compared to Go's popularity and ecosystem. Our industry works in mysterious ways, who knows why some languages gain traction while others don't. Also, this might have some truth to it:There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming LanguageNevertheless, I found the V language interesting! It's a garbage-collected language that seems to have found a sweet spot between Go's simplicity and Rust's powerful type system.Examples in other languagesIf you made it this far, I'll leave you with a link to this repository. It contains an implementation of the example sum type from this article, with JSON encoding/decoding (where applicable), in the following languages:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Debian point release 12.10.....if you care and use.</title><link>https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250315</link><author>/u/unixbhaskar</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 04:42:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Debian project is pleased to announce the tenth update of its
stable distribution Debian 12 (codename ).
This point release mainly adds corrections for security issues,
along with a few adjustments for serious problems. Security advisories
have already been published separately and are referenced where available.Please note that the point release does not constitute a new version of Debian
12 but only updates some of the packages included. There is
no need to throw away old  media. After installation,
packages can be upgraded to the current versions using an up-to-date Debian
mirror.Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages, and most such updates are
included in the point release.New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by
pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.

I own a steamdeck and use their storefront, and have bought many games from them. However, as a linux user, over the years I've developed a strange feeling about their linux push. So, first thing thats crossed my mind is their main selling point in the space, Proton (and by proxy, wine). The whole idea is running windows applications and specifically games on linux. But that doesn't really feel like a long term solution. It basically requires that anything to do with gaming necessarily depends on windows and its systems. If people just stopped making windows builds of their stuff then linux gaming would suffer just as much.You would think that by now they would have tried to address this, and while I know the classic XKCD joke of "14 Competing Standards" rings here, but Valve has the best chance out of everyone to try, even if it fails, they'd still ideally have wine to fall back on.My second question is more to do with their lack of any movement outside of gaming. Don't get me wrong, they are a  platform and gaming focused developer. I'm not expecting them to shoulder the whole of the desktop on their shoulders, but it would be a serious feather in their cap to directly advertise that their software can do more then  gaming. The whole desktop mode of their flagship distro is fully featured just like any other.Third question, and this is more of a plea for context if it exists then a question, have they said anything about their long term goals anywhere, because I haven't heard anything. I'd love to know if they do actually have a roadmap, if only to know how to set my expectations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ask Slashdot: Where Are the Open-Source Local-Only AI Solutions?</title><link>https://ask.slashdot.org/story/25/03/16/015209/ask-slashdot-where-are-the-open-source-local-only-ai-solutions?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 03:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Why can't we each have our own AI software that runs locally," asks long-time Slashdot reader BrendaEM — and that doesn't steal the work of others. 

Imagine a powerful-but-locally-hosted LLM that "doesn't spy... and no one else owns it."
 We download it, from souce-code if you like, install it, if we want. And it assists: us... No one gate-keeps it. It's not out to get us... 

And this is important: because no one owns it, the AI software is ours and leaks no data anywhere — to no one, no company, for no political nor financial purpose. No one profits — but you! 

Their longer original submission also asks a series of related questions — like why can't we have software without AI? (Along with "Why is AMD stamping AI on local-processors?" and "Should AI be crowned the ultimate hype?") But this question seems to be at the heart of their concern. "What future will anyone have if anything they really wanted to do — could be mimicked and sold by the ill-gotten work of others...?" 

"Could local, open-source, AI software be the only answer to dishearten billionaire companies from taking and selling back to their customers — everything we have done? Could we not...instead — steal their dream?!"

Après une phase de tensions maximales, Américains et Ukrainiens ont renoué le dialogue cette semaine en proposant une trêve d'un mois, que la Russie n'a pas encore acceptée."C'est un moment de vérité parce que si la Russie ne s'engage pas sincèrement dans la paix", "le président Trump va durcir les sanctions et les représailles et donc on changera totalement de dynamique", a estimé Emmanuel Macron.Selon le chef de l'Etat français, "plusieurs pays européens, et d'ailleurs non européens, ont manifesté leur volonté de se joindre" à un éventuel envoi de troupes en Ukraine pour garantir un futur accord de paix avec la Russie. Il s'agirait de "quelques milliers d'hommes" par Etat, déployés "dans des points-clés, pour faire des programmes d'entraînement" et "montrer notre soutien dans la durée", a-t-il assuré. Jusqu'ici, Moscou s'oppose fermement à un tel déploiement."Les Ukrainiens ne peuvent en aucun cas faire des concessions territoriales et n'avoir aucune garantie de sécurité", a-t-il prévenu.S'agissant du renforcement massif de la défense acté par l'Union européenne la semaine dernière, il a expliqué avoir demandé aux industriels français de l'armement réunis vendredi à l'Elysée de "démarcher les Etats européens qui ont pris l'habitude d'acheter américain"."Ceux qui achètent (des missiles) Patriot, il faut leur proposer le SAM-T nouvelle génération franco-italien; ceux qui achètent du F35, il faut leur proposer du Rafale", a-t-il martelé. Il entend d'ailleurs "produire plus" de ces avions de chasse du groupe Dassault Aviation "plutôt que d'accélérer le programme d'avion du futur".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple&apos;s long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found</title><link>https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/03/apples-long-lost-hidden-recovery-partition-from-1994-has-been-found/</link><author>chmaynard</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:07:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last post about hard drives that go bad over time, I hinted at having rescued a lost piece of obscure Apple software history from an old 160 MB Conner hard drive that had its head stuck in the parked position. This post is going to be all about it. It’s the tale of a tad bit of an obsession, what felt like a hopeless search, and how persistence eventually paid off. There’s still an unsolved mystery too, so I’m hoping others will see this and help to fill in the blanks!The LC 550’s Secret PartitionIf Apple’s programmers, in creating the Performa series, were aiming to make idiot-proof computers, they were serious about it. The Performa 550 is an amazing case in point. When you run the included Apple Backup program (see Chapter 15), you get a little surprise that you didn’t count on: a  on your hard drive!This invisible chunk of hard drive space contains a miniature, invisible System Folder. Apple’s internal memo explains it this way:“When a system problem (one that prevents the Performa from booting) is detected, a [dialog box] informs the user of a system problem. The user can choose to fix the problem manually or to reinstall software from the backup partition’s Mini System Folder.”If you choose to reinstall your System software, you get the wristwatch cursor for a moment while the miniature System Folder is silently copied to your main hard-drive partition. The Performa restarts from the restored hard drive, and the invisible system partition disappears once again.We got a Performa team member to admit that this kind of sneaky save-the-users-from-themselves approach may well be adopted in other Performa models.Who knows what goodness lurks in the hearts of men?Cool! Although I have owned my own copy of this book for decades, I had no recollection of ever reading this little blurb. The book, if you’re curious, is Macworld Mac Secrets by David Pogue and Joseph Schorr. I found this whole functionality very intriguing, particularly because I had what felt like a very personal connection to it: the very first Mac that my family had when I was growing up was a Performa 550. I don’t think I have any pictures from back then, but in the meantime I’ve acquired one that looks exactly identical, so here’s a (slightly blurry) view of the type of machine I’m talking about in this post:I know that many people think the LC/Performa 5xx case style is ugly, but I really like it! I’m definitely biased though.This is an early model manufactured in September of 1993, which came with a caddy-loading CD-ROM drive (AppleCD 300i). Like other Macs from the same era, newer versions from 1994 came with a tray-loading drive instead (AppleCD 300i Plus). For comparison, here’s a photo of a late-model Performa 550 with a manufacture date of March 1994 that re4mat kindly gave me permission to share here:Pierre asked me if I had a copy of Apple’s software restoration CD for the Performa 550, and if I knew how to get it working in an emulator in order to try out this special functionality. I pointed him to a download link for the Performa CD for the 500 Series, version 7.1P6:If you weren’t using multimedia computers in the early 1990s, you might not recognize the weird rectangular container that this CD is enclosed inside of. It’s a CD caddy, and it’s what was used for inserting CDs into computers like the first one pictured above. You would open the caddy by squeezing the top right and bottom right ends toward each other, stick the disc into it, close it, and then push it into the slot in the computer, similarly to how you would insert a floppy disk. I really don’t miss these things one bit!Back to the story, though. I also gave Pierre some tips for using the restore CD in an emulator. Nowadays, my advice is outdated because it’s much easier to use Apple restore CDs in at least one emulator — MAME has come a long way in the last few years. He figured out a bunch more stuff on his own after that, including trying it in his own Performa 450 (not 550), but the bottom line was that the recovery partition was nowhere to be found.Well, sort of. He found that the process of restoring from the CD actually did create a recovery partition. Here’s a screenshot of the partitioning from inside of Apple HD SC Setup while booted from the Performa CD, after formatting the hard drive by clicking the Initialize button in the main window:As you can see, there’s a 2,560 KB partition of type Apple_Recovery almost at the end of the drive, just after the main partition named “Hard Disk”. This was promising at first glance, but the partition was empty! Further testing revealed that the custom Performa-specific version of Apple HD SC Setup (7.2.2P6) bundled on the CD was responsible for creating it, but didn’t actually populate it with any data. Apple Backup also didn’t put anything onto the partition, despite what the book said. I even looked through my past disassemblies of the Apple Backup and Apple Restore code and confirmed that there was nothing related to creating a recovery partition.The conclusion at the time was that someone needed to get ahold of a Performa 550 that still had its original hard drive and had never been reformatted. That’s where this story sat for 3 years. A few months ago, I remembered this whole situation and decided that I really wanted to try to find this partition. After all, the clock had always been ticking. The longer we waited, the fewer and fewer original Performa 550s would be out there in the wild. Not to mention that hard drives go bad and people throw them out without knowing that it’s usually possible to recover data from drives of this era. I confirmed all of Pierre’s findings in MAME. I even tried using Apple Backup in case I missed something, but no, it didn’t do anything with the hidden recovery partition. An easy way to look at it is to manually edit the partition table in a hex editor and change the type from Apple_Recovery to Apple_HFS.After doing this and booting up, I found another hard drive icon on my desktop called Recovery Volume, but it was empty, just like Pierre said:Taking it a bit further, I tried recreating the recovery functionality myself. I copied a minimal system folder to the Recovery Volume, and then changed its type back to Apple_Recovery. This made it invisible again. Then I screwed up my main system folder and rebooted. Sure enough, it automatically came up with the Recovery Volume as the main boot volume.This proved that the mechanism for booting from the recovery partition worked; we were just missing the data that was supposed to be on it. I came to the same conclusion that Pierre had already reached: we needed to find a Performa 550 that had never been reformatted. In the meantime, I spent some time digging into archives of Apple’s old tech notes and found several more references to this functionality.Backup Partition Software-automatically detects corrupted system folders. When a bad System Folder is detected, the user is given the option to re-load another System Folder into their system.The Apple Backup application creates a backup recovery partition that allows the Performa to boot even when the System Software on the main hard drive has been corrupted. The partition is invisible to the user.There is no built-in limit to the number of times the backup partition can be used. However, the partition will be lost if the hard drive is re-formatted. At this time the backup partition is used only on the Performa 550.Performa 550: System Folder Created w/ Dinosaur Safari CD (8/94) — not that I needed any more proof of the recovery partition’s existence at this point, but I got a kick out of this one. It talks about how launching an educational game about dinosaurs accidentally caused the system to go into recovery mode. It provided a little more info about what would happen when the recovery dialog popped up:When I launch the Dinosaur Safari CD from Creative Multimedia, a dialog box appears telling me that my Performa computer is having trouble starting up. I only have two options Shutdown or Continue? Why?After reading these articles, I was very convinced that the recovery partition was a real thing that existed, but I was also pretty confident that Apple Backup wasn’t responsible for creating it, despite Apple claiming otherwise. I had already seen that the special build of Apple HD SC Setup was what actually created it, and plus, like I said earlier, I had looked closely into a disassembly of the version of Apple Backup supplied with the Performa 500 series restore CD. There was nothing that copied any files to another partition on the hard drive, at least not that I could see.Really, the most important thing I gained from this exercise was that the second tech note confirmed the need to find a Performa 550 that had never been reformatted. Also, if the first tech note was to be believed, it needed to have come with System 7.1P6. This could narrow the search even further — I know for a fact that earlier Performa 550 models came with 7.1P5, including my childhood one. The same tech note also pointed out that 7.1P6 was the first version to support the “AppleCD 300+”, which is referring to the tray-loading CD-ROM drive. Based on this information, it’s reasonable to deduce that all Performa 550s with a tray-loading CD-ROM drive would probably have originally come with at least System 7.1P6.There was only one thing left to try at this point: asking the Internet for help. I asked people everywhere I could think of: Tinker Different, 68kMLA (where Pierre had already asked), and various social media sites. I searched Reddit and found people who had posted in the past about having a 550, asking if they still had the hard drive. I think I scared some of them — at least one person deleted their post after I asked! To be honest, I can’t blame them. I can imagine how freaky it would be to hear from someone begging to look at my hard drive’s contents. I’m sure some people might think of it as crossing a line, but it’s not as crazy of an ask if it’s a machine they’ve received second-hand from someone else. Plus, I was very clear about exactly what I was looking for (and why).I asked a seller of a Performa 550 that had been sitting on eBay for a long time if they would be willing to sell me the hard drive separately. They weren’t interested. I even bought some random hard drives on eBay that definitely went with a 5xx-style case. These were easy to identify because this case style uses a unique adapter for plugging the drive into the chassis wiring harness when you slide it into place.What do I have to show for all of these eBay purchases? Well, after dumping them all with my ZuluSCSI in initiator mode, I can say that the one pictured above came from a Macintosh TV. I also found another one from an LC 575. Lastly, I bought yet another drive that the seller said came from a Performa 577. The Performa 577 one was funny — it had all the Mac mounting hardware on it, but when I dumped it, it turned out to be from an Atari TT or Falcon (not sure which). I’d love to hear the story of how it ended up with an LC 5xx drive sled and adapter on it! Needless to say, none of them had the elusive recovery partition. One particularly friendly eBay seller was even nice enough to show me a preview of a drive’s contents in HFSExplorer, which helped me determine that it wasn’t from a Performa.I almost began questioning my sanity at one point during this search. Multiple people initially told me that they thought I was confused about this whole thing. I pointed them toward Apple’s tech notes describing it. Were Pierre and I imagining this whole thing? Were Apple’s tech notes all a lie?The thing is, this whole functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that hadn’t been preserved!Someone who saw my post on Reddit mentioned that they had a Performa 550 and would check it out. It was a newer tray-loading model with a January 1994 manufacture date. Unfortunately, the Conner hard drive inside of it wouldn’t cooperate, and plus this person didn’t have anything capable of dumping the contents. Luckily for me though, they were totally comfortable with letting me borrow the drive and try to recover the data from it.To tie everything together, we have now reached the point in this story that I covered in my last post about hard drives with stuck heads. As I mentioned in that blog, I could not get this drive to do anything. It would just spin up, sit there for a while, spin down, and then make an annoying buzzing sound for a while, repeating that whole process over and over again.I tried all kinds of things. I nudged the head while the platters were spinning, inspected it with my thermal camera to see if any components were getting hot, and tried it at different temperatures — cold shortly after it arrived, and at room temperature later. The only thing I noticed was that when it was making the buzzing sound, one of the IRFD123 MOSFETs would get much hotter than normal: up near 100 degrees Celsius.I wasn’t really sure what to do with this information though. It just seemed wrong that the head wasn’t moving at all. That’s when I finally decided to inspect everything further inside the drive and noticed the head stack seemed like it was sticking to a rubber/plastic looking piece. The Kapton tape trick I figured out and showed off in the last post finally allowed me to dump the drive contents. If you didn’t catch it last time, here’s a video showing how it was stuck, along with a successful dump with the help of the tape:As soon as the drive imaging process completed, I powered everything off and anxiously opened the hard drive image file with my favorite hex editor (HxD):Boom! This drive had a recovery partition on it! Now, that didn’t necessarily mean anything. After all, I had already seen an empty partition created by Apple HD SC Setup on the Performa CD. Still, though, it was definitely promising. Here’s an interpretation of the data at the beginning of the entry in the partition table:50 4D = PM = Signature00 00 = Padding00 00 00 05 = 5 total partitions on the drive00 04 E2 60 = starting physical block of the partition (0x4E260 blocks = 0x9C4C000 bytes)00 00 14 00 = size of partition in blocks (0x1400 blocks = 0x280000 bytes = 2560 kilobytes)name = MacOSAlso, just like in the partition table created by the Performa CD that I had inspected earlier, there were four bytes “msjy” at an offset of 0x9C bytes into the partition table entry. No other partitions had any data at 0x9C. I wonder if these are a couple of developers’ initials hiding in there or something? Is it an acronym? “Make Steve Jobs Yodel”? I even asked ChatGPT to come up with a playful interpretation in the context of Macs in the mid-1990s. It suggested “My System Jammed Yesterday”, explaining it as a playful nod to the “chaotic charm” of the era’s extension conflicts and Sad Mac screens. I didn’t even mention anything about it involving OS recovery. Tell me how you really feel about old Macs, ChatGPT!Knowing that the partition was there, the next step was to look near the end of the dumped drive image in HxD. If the partition had any actual data stored, it would be very obvious because starting at 0x9C4C000 in the file, there would be actual data and not just a bunch of zeros.This is where I started to actually get excited. The partition contained boot blocks! This was obvious because of the starting signature of LK and all of the various system file names plainly visible. On the other hand, the recovery partition created by the Performa CD during testing had zeros at this location — no boot blocks.These boot blocks are identical to the main partition’s boot blocks, except for one very important difference: at 0x1A, the Pascal string containing the Finder name is “recovery” instead of “Finder” like you’d normally see. This means that if you boot from this partition, it will load a program named recovery instead of the usual Finder app you’d expect on most Mac OS installs.This was definitely something special that the restore CD was not capable of recreating. As I scrolled further down through the partition, it quickly became obvious that it actually had some files!Okay, now I was totally stoked! I booted up a copy of the imaged drive in MAME and immediately noticed that there was evidence that the recovery partition had definitely activated itself on this machine in the past: there was a folder named  on the desktop with a creation date in 2004, and the trash contained an app called Read Me Mini System Folder with the exact same date.I wanted to experience the automatic OS recovery process for myself without any customizations from the original owner of the machine this hard drive came from, so I used HxD to copy the entire 2,560 KB recovery partition onto the fresh hard drive image I had created by restoring from the Performa CD. This was easy because the Performa version of Apple HD SC Setup had created an empty recovery partition with the exact same size. Then I booted it up in MAME and dragged the System file out of my System Folder in order to intentionally mess it up. I had to turn off System Folder Protection in the Performa control panel first:This is the classic kind of mistake that would have normally left you with an unbootable system showing a floppy disk icon with a flashing question mark. Would Apple’s automatic Performa OS recovery save me from myself? I rebooted to see what would happen. Instead of seeing a flashing question mark, I saw a Happy Mac very briefly before the system rebooted itself again. Then another Happy Mac showed up, and this time, it looked like a normal boot, except no extension icons showed up at the bottom of the screen. It was definitely booting from the recovery partition. Eventually, I was greeted with this screen:Hooray! This was exactly the dialog box that Macworld Mac Secrets and Apple’s tech note had referred to. The recovery partition had been successfully rescued!Let’s walk through the rest of this feature. If you click Shut Down, obviously the machine turns itself off. But when it boots back up, the recovery partition doesn’t automatically kick in anymore. So you’re on your own to fix the problem by booting from the Performa CD or the Utilities floppy disk.On the other hand, clicking OK does exactly what the tech note describes. You get the wristwatch cursor for a few seconds, the system reboots, and then you are greeted with this amazing screen, complete with an ugly yellow desktop pattern. Shall we call it the yellow screen of shame? Notice that the Mini System Folder on the desktop is the active System Folder, because it has the special icon.Here are the rest of the pages in this Read Me Mini System Folder app:Aha! So it’s not entirely automatic, since you still have to manually drag the System, Finder, and System Enablers from the Mini System Folder back to your original System Folder. Still though, it’s a very handy solution that gives you a bootable machine when something goes wrong with your OS.If you just ignore these instructions and keep using the computer, you will be nagged with this Read Me on every boot because it lives inside the Startup Items folder of the Mini System Folder. The Read Me also appears on your desktop, but for some reason it doesn’t show up until you open the Hard Disk icon.Let’s take a deeper look at how it all works by temporarily changing the partition type to Apple_HFS instead of Apple_Recovery and booting up again, so we can inspect the files. After a quick automatic rebuild of the desktop file, the Recovery Volume appears, with actual contents this time!Inside of the System Folder, there are definitely some interesting things. As expected based on the earlier analysis of the boot blocks, there is an app named “recovery” that contains all of the interesting stuff. The icons are kind of arranged willy-nilly in here.The creator code of the recovery app is msjy — the exact same magic value we saw in the partition table entry.Scrolling further down, there is a System file and various enablers. Everything is marked as being part of System Software v7.1P6.It’s interesting to me that although this recovery partition was only available on the 550, it still has a bunch of enablers for other Performa models: the 45x/46x, 47x/57x, and 600. I guess that’s not too crazy considering all of these exact same enablers are included with a fresh copy of System 7.1P6 installed using the Performa CD.As a quick detour, System Enabler 316 is an interesting one that is hard to find info about on the Internet. I inspected its ‘gbly’ resource and determined that it’s for the Centris 610, Centris 650, and Quadra 800. It’s an older version of the enabler created before the speed-bumped Quadra 610 and Quadra 650 were a thing. I wonder if there was a plan at some point to have a Performa model based on one of those machines? If I had to guess, maybe it would have been a 68040-based successor to the Performa 600, which uses the same case style as the Centris 650. The Performa 650?Let’s not get too far off track. Back to the Recovery Volume’s System Folder — as expected, the Startup Items folder contains the Read Me application:Everything started to become clear. The recovery app was marked as the startup application instead of the Finder. It displayed the dialog giving the user the option to recover. If they clicked OK, it would copy the entire System Folder from the Recovery Volume, omitting itself, to the Desktop Folder of the main hard drive partition. Then, it would “bless” the newly-copied mini System Folder and reboot.How did all this stuff get into the partition? Did Apple Backup do it, or was it factory-programmed data? I tried to see if I could deduce anything from the dates of the files. In order to preserve the integrity of all of the displayed dates, I performed this analysis with a read-only copy of the original drive image in order to prevent any modification dates from being updated.All of the files in the partition have a creation date of March 4, 1994 — over 31 years ago! Most of the files have a matching modification date, except for the System suitcase, which was last modified on September 26, 1994. I don’t know exactly what this all means, considering it came from a machine with a January 1994 manufacture date.The Recovery Volume itself also has a creation date of March 4th, just five minutes before the creation date of all the files. Interestingly, the modification date of the volume is still shown as March 4th in the Get Info window, even though the System suitcase was modified later in September of that year.The Master Directory Block of the Recovery Volume says the modification date (drLsMod) is September 26th, matching when the System file was changed. I’m not sure what causes this discrepancy. I guess the date displayed in the Get Info window isn’t simply the date stored in the Master Directory Block.Similarly, although the main hard drive partition has a creation date of December 5, 1993 according to the Master Directory Block, the Get Info window says it was created on February 3, 1994. I’m not sure which one is more accurate. Either way, it’s pretty clear this drive had not been reformatted. I did find it curious that the recovery partition was created over a month later, though. When you reformat a hard drive using the special version of Apple HD SC Setup on the Performa CD, the recovery partition ends up with a creation date about a minute after the main partition.The Finder and System Enablers in the recovery partition are identical to the same stock files from a 7.1P6 restore. The only difference I could find in the System file was that the recovery partition’s version was missing a single At Ease ‘INIT’ resource, but the At Ease Startup extension automatically adds it to the System file after you reboot. This leaves you with a System file totally identical to what is restored from the Performa CD. I find it odd that At Ease was stripped out, but the American Heritage Dictionary ‘FKEY’ resource was not.The best theory that I can come up with is that Apple Backup really was responsible for creating this partition. After all, Apple went out of their way to specifically mention it in their tech note. Maybe March 4th, 1994 was the date when the original owner of the computer backed it up for the first time. September 26th could have been the last time that Apple Backup was run. Perhaps the owner completely uninstalled At Ease from the computer between March and September, so the System file had been changed and the recovery copy needed to be updated accordingly? Unfortunately, most of the Performa-specific software had been deleted from this computer. It was still running System 7.1P6, but Apple Backup was nowhere to be found. So I wasn’t able to confirm whether or not a mysterious, unpreserved newer version of Apple Backup was really responsible for populating the partition.The other theory floating around in my head is that maybe it came from the factory like this. The March 1994 timeline is consistent with the date of the tech note describing the functionality, so maybe that’s when Apple created it and started bundling it. I don’t know how long the machines sat at Apple’s factory before they were actually sold — does a manufacture date of January 1994 also mean it was shipped to a store in January 1994? Either way, I definitely don’t know how to explain the September 26th, 1994 modification date. Maybe a third-party utility did something to the System file on the secondary partition? The first Apple Backup theory seems like the more likely explanation, especially given that Apple said that’s how it was created.This whole question is the last piece of the puzzle that hasn’t been solved yet. If anyone else has a Performa 550 and would be willing to dump their hard drive or at least look at Apple Backup, I’d be very interested in finding out A) if it has the recovery partition and B) if there was a special newer version of Apple Backup that didn’t make its way onto the Performa CD. I searched for various strings that show up in the “recovery” and “Read Me Mini System Folder” apps, and they aren’t anywhere on the Performa CD. I guess they could be stored compressed somewhere, but I’m pretty confident based on the actual Apple Backup code that nothing is hiding in there. Here are the various versions (with their exact sizes and dates) of Apple Backup that I have seen on Performa 550 installations. None of these have the recovery partition creation built in:I also found version 1.3 (June 15, 1994, 163,388 bytes used) by restoring from a Performa 636 restore CD. It, too, does not contain any recovery partition code.For a demo, I thought it would be fun to replicate the problem that the Apple tech note mentioned about the Dinosaur Safari CD inadvertently activating the recovery partition, so I bought a copy to test it out. To make it even more interesting, I decided to run this test on real hardware. I’m leaning toward believing that a lot of the older caddy-loading models (possibly all of them) didn’t have this recovery partition, so just pretend it’s a newer model that came with System 7.1P6. I copied the recovery partition onto a real Apple-branded IBM 160 MB SCSI hard drive using ZuluSCSI’s USB MSC initiator mode, which allows it to act as a USB-to-SCSI bridge. Sorry about the flickery screen; I couldn’t get my phone camera’s shutter speed to sync up perfectly with the display’s refresh rate.Sure enough, when I opened the game from the CD, the computer did exactly what Apple’s tech note said it would do. The workaround of copying the application to my hard drive worked just fine. If it’s not obvious, I sped up the process of copying it to the hard drive — it took a while! It might be interesting someday to look into why this game accidentally activated the OS recovery, but this blog is already getting way too long!I want to talk a little more about the yellow screen of shame. When I first saw it, I wasn’t entirely sure if it was really part of the recovery functionality or if the original owner just had terrible taste.Digging deeper, I found three clues that all made it clear it was an intentional choice by Apple to really make it obvious that something was wrong. First, the yellow pattern is stored as a ‘ppat’ resource in the recovery app.Second, the System file in the recovery partition has the default blue-gray Performa background shown in the screenshots above. This makes sense, because it’s the pattern that showed up with the dialog about the Performa having trouble starting up.And lastly, page 3 of the Read Me app implies that something may have changed your desktop pattern.So clearly, the recovery process, by design, sets up the custom yellow background.Why did I care so much about finding this lost partition? Well, there are a number of reasons. For one, this is exactly the kind of research project that’s perfect for me because I don’t know how to let things go. It’s also something that, quite frankly, needed to be preserved before it became extinct. The most important reason, though, is that this functionality is historically significant and deserves some attention. How many personal computers in 1994 still had the ability to boot after the OS was trashed? Isn’t this an extremely early example of this type of functionality? Did Windows have anything like this prior to Vista? Did the Mac have anything else like this prior to sometime in the OS X era? I would love to hear more comments about what you think on this. I admittedly don’t know a ton about older machines that weren’t Macs.I’m not saying this feature is perfect. Since we’ve already seen that the Dinosaur Safari CD was able to accidentally activate it, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were other ways to inadvertently cause it to pop up too. It also required manual intervention after the recovery process, which meant that you needed a fair amount of computer knowledge to finish fixing your OS. The average Joe Schmoe would probably have trouble following these directions to fix the System Folder. But still, it leaves you with a bootable system instead of an unusable computer with a flashing question mark. It’s very cool, especially for 1994.I wonder why Apple didn’t continue down this path with subsequent models? Or even retroactively adding the functionality to earlier ones after a fresh install of a newer OS. I’m not aware of any other Macs that have this partition. It doesn’t depend on any special ROM support or anything like that, at least as far as I can see. I tried out the recovery functionality on several other machines: a IIci, LC, LC 475, and an emulated Performa 600, and it works great on all of them. Heck, it even works on the Classic II/Performa 200!It kind of looks like the window size of the Read Me app was a calculated decision to ensure it would fit on the 512×342 screen used in black-and-white compact Macs.Thinking about later models, the Performa 630 series used an internal IDE hard drive instead of SCSI, so the custom version of Apple HD SC Setup was no longer used. I wonder if the Performa 57x series had this partition? You’d think they would have had the exact same software bundle as the tray-loading 550 models. If any readers have a Performa 57x machine, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could check!How did this functionality actually work under the hood? I haven’t gone too deep into the code (maybe it can be a future post), but I have pieced together a few clues. The “msjy” magic number I talked about earlier definitely plays a part in everything. The special Performa version of Apple HD SC Setup also includes a custom version of Apple’s hard disk driver. This driver contains several references to msjy, so I’m pretty sure that’s what it uses to identify the recovery partition.I also discovered that the 7.1P4 and 7.1P5 Utilities floppy disks, which were bundled with various Performas, have slightly older custom versions of Apple HD SC Setup: 7.2.1P and 7.2.2P respectively. They also create the recovery partition. The interesting thing about these versions is that it appears Apple accidentally forgot to strip out the debug function names, in both the utility itself and the bundled hard disk driver. They didn’t make this mistake in the original non-Performa 7.2.2 version, and they also didn’t make the mistake in the newer 7.2.2P6 version. Anyway, this is kind of cool, because it tells me the names of functions that look for “msjy” at an offset of 0x9C. Function names in that same area of the driver code include: , , , , and . So Apple definitely at least sort of released some of the recovery functionality to the public prior to 7.1P6, despite what their own version history says. And the disk driver is definitely involved in it.Newer versions of Apple’s disk driver no longer contain the magic number, so at some point they must have abandoned this functionality. In my opinion, it’s a real shame that they ditched it — this could have been very useful going forward on all Macs. They could have even expanded on it and automated more of the recovery process. Sure, it used some of your hard drive space, but it could have been a good trade-off for better reliability.That’s more than enough technical stuff for one post. I am sharing a download link where you can try this functionality out for yourself if you want. After all, the whole reason I did this was for software preservation purposes, so it makes sense to share it with the world. This is a small piece of Apple software history that, to my knowledge, has not been preserved until now. I uploaded a drive image to the Macintosh Garden. Don’t worry, I didn’t include any of the original owner’s personal data. I started fresh with a blank hard drive image, restored it using the 7.1P6 Performa CD, and then only copied over the restore partition from the dumped hard drive. So this is a factory-fresh Performa 550 7.1P6 install with the recovery partition also present and populated.The MAME command that I use to boot from this disk image is:Of course, you can also test it out on a real machine by copying the hard drive image to a ZuluSCSI or BlueSCSI and naming it something like HD00.hda.Winding down this super long post now, the main lessons I learned from this research project are:If you get your hands on a vintage computer, strongly consider backing the hard drive up before erasing it. I know it might contain someone’s personal files, so be mindful of that, and of course respect their privacy. But there might still be something hiding in the background that has been lost to time. You never know — it happened here!The fact that many hard drives go bad as they age might actually be a good thing for software preservation. If a vintage computer’s hard drive has a stuck head that can easily be bypassed, someone might sell it as non-working with data intact, rather than erasing it and selling it as “fully tested and wiped”.There are some really awesome people out there in the world!Special thanks to Pierre for discovering that this functionality even existed in the first place, and getting the word out so we could eventually preserve it. I also have to thank David Pogue and Joseph Schorr for writing about it in their book many decades ago. And of course, huge thanks to the amazing person from Reddit, who asked not to be credited, who gave me the opportunity to borrow and repair the drive that ended up containing the lost partition. You’re seriously the best!I’m going to repeat this again in case anybody has scrolled all the way to the end. There are still missing pieces of knowledge about how exactly this recovery partition would have been originally created. If you happen to have a Performa 550 with its original hard drive and wouldn’t mind checking for the partition and/or a special version of Apple Backup, please let me know! I would be happy to walk anybody through the process of dumping the drive contents. I’ll send you something if you don’t have the equipment needed to dump a hard drive. Even if the machine has been upgraded to System 7.5 or Mac OS 7.6, it’s still fine — everything could very well still be there, lurking in the background.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joby Aviation and Virgin Atlantic partner to launch electric air taxis in the UK</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/joby-aviation-and-virgin-atlantic-partner-to-launch-electric-air-taxis-in-the-uk/</link><author>Rebecca Bellan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joby Aviation is partnering with Virgin Atlantic to launch electric air taxis in the U.K., marking the seventh country in which the startup hopes to one day commercialize.

In the past these issues have been resolved quickly (within a week) and apologies issued with promises to do better. (See 2024-03-11, 2024-07-08, and 2025-01-30.) 

This time around it has been over six weeks and CloudFlare has been unable or unwilling to fix the problem on their end, effectively stalling any progress on the matter with various tactics including asking browser developers to sign overarching NDAs. 

That last link is an update posted today by Pale Moon's main developer:



Our current situation remains unchanged: CloudFlare is still blocking our access to websites through the challenges, and the captcha/turnstile continues to hang the browser until our watchdog terminates the hung script after which it reloads and hangs again after a short pause (but allowing users to close the tab in that pause, at least). To say that this upsets me is an understatement. Other than deliberate intent or absolute incompetence, I see no reason for this to endure. Neither of those options are very flattering for CloudFlare.

I wish I had better news.

It’s the successor to the venerable ESP8266 which has found its way into many of our WiFi connected devices (seriously, open up a device and chances are relatively large that you’ll find one).After having done quite a few projects based on the ESP32 in the Arduino and esp-idf frameworks I did start to notice some pecularities with my deployed devices (fancy wording for the one in my electrical cabinet that’s  to send the electrical usage data somewhere and a hodgepodge of sensor boards around the house, mostly the Snuffelaar by Sebastius with firmware written by Juerd).It seemed some of my ESP32 based boards were regularly losing connectivity. Initially my thoughts went out to the terrible power supplies I was using to run them (the cheapest of the cheap USB power supplies that came with a variety of accessories around my house). After switching these out for some more accessible and probably better quality tested Ikea chargers the problems, however, persisted.Asking around for experience from others at RevSpace, my local hackerspace, seemed to indicate that people had seen similar things with their ESP32-based projects. But not everyone had these issues. Slowly I started gathering more and more “superstitions” around how to keep these microcontrollers connected to my internet. Here are my favorite ones, I have applied all of these and while I haven’t tested them one-by-one the combination of them has ensured steady connections on my SSIDs.While these workarounds don’t quite come close to placing a hexagon of CR2023 batteries around your ESP32 while you chant the 802.11ax specification at it, they have no basis in any  research I did. Take these as anecdotal workarounds for ESP32’s losing connectivity to your WiFi.Turn off power saving on the ESP32The ESP8266 never had any power saving for its WiFi modem stack, however the ESP32 . To me this is the most likely culprit in that in some network configurations, perhaps in combination with some radios, the power saving does something that makes it stop interacting with the network.In your personal handcrafted firmware you can use the following, which should work in esp-idf  Arduino (from what I’ve been told):For ESPHome based projects you can add:Set your APs to use 20 Mhz wide channelsIf you have fancy network hardware then you can likely configure the channel width for the network that serves your ESP32’s. From what people and the internet tell me you  set the band width on the 2.4 Ghz network that your boards use to , not 40, not 60, and definitely not automatic.Pin your ESP32’s to a single APIt seems that when an ESP32 connects it goes straight for the first access point it sees. No matter if that access point is not the one you’ve taped it to. This can lead to bad connectivity, especially since I’ve not really observed ESP32’s moving around to other access points. If your network hardware allows it, you should pin the device to the closest one.These urban legends have so far made it seem that at least my problems are ghosts of the past. I haven’t had a device drop from the network in about a week or two now while they used to drop multiple times per day. I’m planning to drop my application level keep-alives (still a good idea, I’ll write about them another time) because they seem to not be necessary at all anymore.I hope these are of help to anyone, and that the spirits of the ESP32 deem your network worthy too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploying Local Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform &amp; KVM</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jc7np0/deploying_local_kubernetes_cluster_with_terraform/</link><author>/u/rached2023</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 23:06:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm trying to deploy a local Kubernetes cluster (1 master & 2 workers) using Terraform on KVM-based virtual machines.

 They are removing parking spaces and creating dedicated bike lanes. They are installing cameras at the perimeter of urban centers and either charging the most-polluting vehicles or preventing them from entering. Some are going so far as to put entire neighborhoods off-limits to vehicles. In Norway, Oslo promotes "car-free livability." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo touts the "end of car dependence." And while those ideas might sound radical to car-loving Americans, they are fast becoming the norm across the Atlantic, where 340 European cities and towns — home to more than 150 million people — have implemented some kind of restrictions on personal car usage... 

[V]irtually every major European city is imposing some kind of rule. Milan has a system similar to New York's, charging for access to the city core — while entirely banning older, highly polluting vehicles. London charges vehicles that don't meet emissions standards, in what it calls the "largest clean-air zone in the world." The programs are not just the purview of liberal Western Europe: Warsaw, Poland, and Sofia, Bulgaria, recently adopted similar schemes. Even little Italian villages have added vehicle restrictions to reinforce their historic feel. And the Netherlands just broke ground on a 12,000-person neighborhood that will be entirely car-free. The neighborhood, known as Merwede, will be connected by public transport to Utrecht, a medium-size city that — perhaps no surprise — has a low-emissions zone of its own... 

 Perhaps the most elaborate and transformative effort has come in Paris, where Anne Hidalgo was elected mayor in 2014. Since then, Paris has banned the most-polluting vehicles from the city, eliminated 50,000 parking spaces and added hundreds of miles of bike lanes. It turned a bank of the Seine from a busy artery into a pedestrian zone, and closed off the famed Rue de Rivoli to traffic... Journeys by car in Paris have dropped by about 45 percent since 1990. The city has now become a source for striking before-and-after photos: of clogged streets that have transitioned into tree-lined areas where people can walk and play. 
In London government officials say inhalable particular matter has fallen, according to the article, while combustion-produced nitrogen dioxide "is 53% lower than it would have been without the restrictions."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar: An alternative to Viktor Orban? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkYFfWxkIE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vtkYFfWxkIE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:44:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hungary's opposition hold large rallies on Hungary's Independence Day.

In April, Ukraine sortied one of its then-new Aeroprakt A-22 sport plane drones to strike a drone plant in Yelabuga, 550 miles east of Moscow.The 2024 raid remains one of the deepest in Ukraine’s escalating campaign of deep strikes on Russian targets, And it may have been the first in which the Ukrainian drones went after the industry supporting Russia’s own drones.It makes sense for the Ukrainians to continue striking Russian drone factories. Ukraine’s edge in drone warfare is perhaps its most important advantage as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 37th month.Ukrainian drones are so thick in the sky in many of the most important sectors that any Russian vehicles that leave their dugouts “operate in a one-way manner,” one Russian blogger complained.Struggling to jam the well-made Ukrainian drones, the Russians are trying to at least match the explosive UAVs vehicle-for-vehicle—if not exceed them on a technological level.Elite Russian drone groups were the first in Ukraine to deploy unjammable fiber-optic drones that send and receive signals via miles-long cables instead of via radio datalinks, which are vulnerable to Ukrainian electronic warfare.And now the Kremlin is ramping up production of the most numerous first-person-view drones in order to keep pace with Ukrainian production. The Kremlin has announced it will acquire as many as 4 million FPV drones this year; the defense ministry in Kyiv is hoping to acquire 4.5 million. The gap is closing.In blowing up the drone factories, ironically with drones, the Ukrainian intelligence agency hopes to throttle Russian production—and ensure that most of the tiny UAVs buzzing over the front line ... are Ukrainian.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fighter jets take off from aircraft carrier as Trump orders strikes on Yemen&apos;s capital</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHJmN4Wdl4U</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uHJmN4Wdl4U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:12:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

While he’s still able to think clearly in many ways, his ability to use technology has taken a hit. He only got into computers and smartphones later in life, and now, with so much of society relying on digital tools—whether it’s banking, doctor appointments, or even just staying in touch—he’s struggling.Where I live, we even have a government-issued two-factor authentication device/app that’s required for almost everything. It’s frustrating for him, and I’ve seen firsthand how technology, which should be making life easier, is actually making him feel more isolated. And let’s be real—this reliance on tech is only going to increase.The Idea I’d love to create an ultra-simple Linux desktop tailored for people like my dad. Something that: • Boots straight into a locked-down, minimal desktop. • Has only a few essential programs, like a web browser, email client, or video calling app. • Allows relatives to configure everything through an admin panel setting bookmarks, fixing icons, and keeping things simple. • Runs on familiar hardware, since Linux makes it easy to install on existing devices with a USB.This would be a passion project. I just see a real need for it, and I’m sure it could help a lot of people.My Question I’m not planning on touching kernel code or diving into low-level OS development. I have some programming experience (mostly in data engineering and data science), but I don’t even know where to start researching a project like this. What tools or frameworks should I look into? Are there existing Linux distros or desktop environments that could be adapted for this purpose?I know this won’t be ready in time to help my dad, but I’d still love to explore the idea. Any pointers would be appreciated!Even if I drop the project along the way I still get to learn something new about Linux ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The numbers</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jc3ivs/the_numbers/</link><author>/u/JexFr</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 19:51:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon’s Echo will send all voice recordings to the cloud, starting March 28</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/amazons-echo-will-send-all-voice-recordings-to-the-cloud-starting-march-28/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 19:47:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon Echo users will no longer have the option to process their Alexa requests locally, which means all of their voice recordings will be sent to the company’s cloud.

Because here's the thing. The $10 billion James Webb Space telescope (in operation since 2022) "has found that the vast majority of deep space and, thus the early galaxies it has so far observed, are rotating in the same direction. While around two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise, the other third rotates counter-clockwise."

In a random universe, scientists would expect to find 50% of galaxies rotating one way, while the other 50% rotate the other way. This new research suggests there is a preferred direction for galactic rotation... "It is still not clear what causes this to happen, but there are two primary possible explanations," team leader Lior Shamir, associate professor of computer science at the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering, said in a statement. "One explanation is that the universe was born rotating. 

"That explanation agrees with theories such as black hole cosmology, which postulates that the entire universe is the interior of a black hole. 

"But if the universe was indeed born rotating, it means that the existing theories about the cosmos are incomplete." Black hole cosmology, also known as "Schwarzschild cosmology," suggests that our observable universe might be the interior of a black hole itself within a larger parent universe. The idea was first introduced by theoretical physicist Raj Kumar Pathria and by mathematician I. J. Good. It presents the idea that the "Schwarzchild radius," better known as the "event horizon," (the boundary from within which nothing can escape a black hole, not even light) is also the horizon of the visible universe. 
The article cites a theory by Polish theoretical physicist Nikodem Poplawski of the University of New Haven that ultimately black holes don't compress indefinitely into a singularity. "The matter instead reaches a state of finite, extremely large density, stops collapsing, undergoes a bounce like a compressed spring, and starts rapidly expanding," Poplawski explained to Space.com...
The scientist continued by adding that rapid recoil after such a big bounce could be what has led to our expanding universe, an event we now refer to as the Big Bang... "I think that the simplest explanation of the rotating universe is the universe was born in a rotating black hole." 
Team leader Shamir offers another theory: that we just need to re-calibrate our distance measurements for the deep universe. (Which could also explain the difference in the expansion rates in the universe "and the large galaxies that according to the existing distance measurements are expected to be older than the universe itself.")]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s tariffs leave US bourbon distillers in limbo | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flwmep6zVgU</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/flwmep6zVgU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Victor Yarbrough, who is a small bourbon producer in Kentucky had been in talks to expand sales in Canada but with the Trump administration’s tariff war, ‘the whole Canadian growth strategy is now on pause,’ he said.

Attackers who are in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization can use it to construct SAML assertions themselves and are in turn able to log in as any user. In other words, it could be used for an account takeover attack. Users of ruby-saml should update to version 1.18.0. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml.In this blog post, we detail newly discovered authentication bypass vulnerabilities in the ruby-saml library used for single sign-on (SSO) via SAML on the service provider (application) side. GitHub doesn’t currently use ruby-saml for authentication, but began evaluating the use of the library with the intention of using an open source library for SAML authentication once more. This library is, however, used in other popular projects and products. We discovered an exploitable instance of this vulnerability in GitLab, and have notified their security team so they can take necessary actions to protect their users against potential attacks.GitHub previously used the ruby-saml library up to 2014, but moved to our own SAML implementation due to missing features in ruby-saml at that time. Following bug bounty reports around vulnerabilities in our own implementation (such as CVE-2024-9487, related to encrypted assertions), GitHub recently decided to explore the use of ruby-saml again. Then in October 2024, a blockbuster vulnerability dropped: an authentication bypass in ruby-saml (CVE-2024-45409) by ahacker1. With tangible evidence of exploitable attack surface, GitHub’s switch to ruby-saml had to be evaluated more thoroughly now. As such, GitHub started a private bug bounty engagement to evaluate the security of the ruby-saml library. We gave selected bug bounty researchers access to GitHub test environments using ruby-saml for SAML authentication. In tandem, the GitHub Security Lab also reviewed the attack surface of the ruby-saml library.As is not uncommon when multiple researchers are looking at the same code, both ahacker1, a participant in the GitHub bug bounty program, and I noticed the same thing during code review: ruby-saml was using two different XML parsers during the code path of signature verification. Namely, REXML and Nokogiri. While REXML is an XML parser implemented in pure Ruby, Nokogiri provides an easy-to-use wrapper API around different libraries like libxml2, libgumbo and Xerces (used for JRuby). Nokogiri supports parsing of XML and HTML. It looks like Nokogiri was added to ruby-saml to support canonicalization and potentially other things REXML didn’t support at that time.We both inspected the same code path in the  of  and found that the signature element to be verified is first read via REXML, and then also with Nokogiri’s XML parser. So, if REXML and Nokogiri could be tricked into retrieving different signature elements for the same XPath query it might be possible to trick ruby-saml into verifying the wrong signature. It looked like there could be a potential authentication bypass due to a !The reality was actually more complicated than this.Roughly speaking, four stages were involved in the discovery of this authentication bypass:Discovering that two different XML parsers are used during code review.  Establishing if and how a parser differential could be exploited.  Finding an actual parser differential for the parsers in use.  Leveraging the parser differential to create a full-blown exploit.To prove the security impact of this vulnerability, it was necessary to complete all four stages and create a full-blown authentication bypass exploit.Quick recap: how SAML responses are validatedSecurity assertion markup language (SAML) responses are used to transport information about a signed-in user from the identity provider (IdP) to the service provider (SP) in XML format. Often the only important information transported is a username or an email address. When the HTTP POST binding is used, the SAML response travels from the IdP to the SP via the browser of the end user. This makes it obvious why there has to be some sort of signature verification in play to prevent the user from tampering with the message.Let’s have a quick look at what a simplified SAML response looks like:Note: in the response above the XML namespaces were removed for better readability.As you might have noticed: the main part of a simple SAML response is its assertion element (A), whereas the main information contained in the assertion is the information contained in the  element (B) (here the NameID containing the username: admin). A real assertion typically contains more information (e.g.  and  dates as part of a  element.)Normally, the  (A) (without the whole  part) is canonicalized and then compared against the  (C) and the  (D) is canonicalized and verified against the  (E). In this sample, the assertion of the SAML response is signed, and in other cases the whole SAML response is signed.Searching for parser differentialsWe learned that ruby-saml used two different XML parsers (REXML and Nokogiri) for validating the SAML response. Now let’s have a look at the verification of the signature and the digest comparison.
The focus of the following explanation lies on the  method inside of .Inside that method, there’s a broad XPath query with REXML for the first signature element inside the SAML document:sig_element = REXML::XPath.first(
  @working_copy,
  "//ds:Signature",
  {"ds"=>DSIG}
)
Hint: When reading the code snippets, you can tell the difference between queries for REXML and Nokogiri by looking at how they are called. REXML methods are prefixed with , whereas Nokogiri methods are called on .Later, the actual  is read from this element:base64_signature = REXML::XPath.first(
  sig_element,
  "./ds:SignatureValue",
  {"ds" => DSIG}
)
signature = Base64.decode64(OneLogin::RubySaml::Utils.element_text(base64_signature))
Note: the name of the  element might be a bit confusing. While it contains the actual signature in the  node it also contains the part that is actually signed in the  node. Most importantly the  element contains the digest (hash) of the assertion and information about the used key.So, an actual  element could look like this (removed namespace information for better readability):<Signature>
    <SignedInfo>
        <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" />
        <SignatureMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256" />
        <Reference URI="#_SAMEID">
            <Transforms><Transform Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" /></Transforms>
            <DigestMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256" />
            <DigestValue>Su4v[..]</DigestValue>
        </Reference>
    </SignedInfo>
    <SignatureValue>L8/i[..]</SignatureValue>
    <KeyInfo>
        <X509Data>
            <X509Certificate>MIID[..]</X509Certificate>
        </X509Data>
    </KeyInfo>
</Signature>
Later in the same method () there’s again a query for the Signature(s)—but this time with Nokogiri.noko_sig_element = document.at_xpath('//ds:Signature', 'ds' => DSIG)
Then the  element is taken from that signature and canonicalized:noko_signed_info_element = noko_sig_element.at_xpath('./ds:SignedInfo', 'ds' => DSIG)

canon_string = noko_signed_info_element.canonicalize(canon_algorithm)
Let’s remember this  contains the canonicalized  element.The  element is then also extracted with REXML: signed_info_element = REXML::XPath.first(
        sig_element,
        "./ds:SignedInfo",
        { "ds" => DSIG }
 )
From this  element the  node is read:ref = REXML::XPath.first(signed_info_element, "./ds:Reference", {"ds"=>DSIG})
reference_nodes = document.xpath("//*[@ID=$id]", nil, { 'id' => extract_signed_element_id })
The method extract_signed_element_idextracts the signed element id with help of REXML. From the previous authentication bypass (CVE-2024-45409), there’s now a check that only one element with the same ID can exist.The first of the  is taken and canonicalized:hashed_element = reference_nodes[0][..]canon_hashed_element = hashed_element.canonicalize(canon_algorithm, inclusive_namespaces)
The  is then hashed:hash = digest_algorithm.digest(canon_hashed_element)
The  to compare it against is then extracted with REXML:encoded_digest_value = REXML::XPath.first(
        ref,
        "./ds:DigestValue",
        { "ds" => DSIG }
      )
digest_value = Base64.decode64(OneLogin::RubySaml::Utils.element_text(encoded_digest_value))
Finally, the  (built from the element extracted by Nokogiri) is compared against the  (extracted with REXML):unless digests_match?(hash, digest_value)
The  extracted some lines ago (a result of an extraction with Nokogiri) is later verified against (extracted with REXML).unless cert.public_key.verify(signature_algorithm.new, signature, canon_string)
In the end, we have the following constellation:The assertion is extracted and canonicalized with Nokogiri, and then hashed. In contrast, the hash against which it will be compared is extracted with REXML.  The SignedInfo element is extracted and canonicalized with Nokogiri - it is then verified against the SignatureValue, which was extracted with REXML.Exploiting the parser differentialThe question is: is it possible to create an XML document where REXML sees one signature and Nokogiri sees another?Ahacker1, participating in the bug bounty, was faster to produce a working exploit using a parser differential. Among other things, ahacker1 was inspired by the XML roundtrips vulnerabilities published by Mattermost’s Juho Forsén in 2021.Not much later, I produced an exploit using a different parser differential with the help of Trail of Bits’ Ruby fuzzer called ruzzy.Both exploits result in an authentication bypass. Meaning that an attacker, who is in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization, can use it to construct assertions for any users which will be accepted by ruby-saml. Such a signature can either come from a signed assertion or response from another (unprivileged) user or in certain cases, it can even come from signed metadata of a SAML identity provider (which can be publicly accessible).An exploit could look like this. Here, an additional Signature was added as part of the  element that is only visible to Nokogiri:The  element (A) from the signature that is visible to Nokogiri is canonicalized and verified against the  (B) that was extracted from the signature seen by REXML.The assertion is retrieved via Nokogiri by looking for its ID. This assertion is then canonicalized and hashed (C). The hash is then compared to the hash contained in the  (D). This DigestValue was retrieved via REXML. This DigestValue has no corresponding signature.So, two things take place:A valid SignedInfo with DigestValue is verified against a valid signature. (which checks out)  A fabricated canonicalized assertion is compared against its calculated digest. (which checks out as well)This allows an attacker, who is in possession of a valid signed assertion for any (unprivileged) user, to fabricate assertions and as such impersonate any other user.Check for errors when using NokogiriParts of the currently known, undisclosed exploits can be stopped by checking for Nokogiri parsing errors on SAML responses. Sadly, those errors do not result in exceptions, but need to be checked on the  member of the parsed document:doc = Nokogiri::XML(xml) do |config|
  config.options = Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::STRICT | Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::NONET
end

raise "XML errors when parsing: " + doc.errors.to_s if doc.errors.any?
While this is far from a perfect fix for the issues at hand, it renders at least one exploit infeasible.We are not aware of any reliable indicators of compromise. While we’ve found a potential indicator of compromise, it only works in debug-like environments and to publish it, we would have to reveal too many details about how to implement a working exploit so we’ve decided that it’s better not to publish it. Instead, our best recommendation is to look for suspicious logins via SAML on the service provider side from IP addresses that do not align with the user’s expected location.SAML and XML signatures:as confusing as it getsSome might say it’s hard to integrate systems with SAML. That might be true. However, it’s even harder to write implementations of SAML using XML signatures in a secure way. As others have stated before: it’s probably best to disregard the specifications, as following them doesn’t help build secure implementations.
To rehash how the validation works if the SAML assertion is signed, let’s have a look at the graphic below,  depicting a simplified SAML response. The assertion, which transports the protected information, contains a signature. Confusing, right?To complicate it even more: What is even signed here? The whole assertion? No!What’s signed is the  element and the  element contains a . This  is the hash of the canonicalized assertion with the signature element removed before the canonicalization. This two-stage verification process can lead to implementations that have a disconnect between the verification of the hash and the verification of the signature. This is the case for these Ruby-SAML parser differentials: while the hash and the signature check out on their own, they have no connection. The hash is actually a hash of the assertion, but the signature is a signature of a different  element containing another hash. What you actually want is a direct connection between the hashed content, the hash, and the signature. (And once the verification is done you only want to retrieve information from the exact part that was actually verified.) Or, alternatively, use a less complicated standard to transport a cryptographically signed username between two systems - but here we are.In this case, the library already extracted the  and used it to verify the signature of its canonicalized string,. However, it did not use it to obtain the digest value. If the library had used the content of the already extracted  to obtain the digest value, it would have been secure in this case even with two XML parsers in use.As shown once again: relying on two different parsers in a security context can be tricky and error-prone. That being said: exploitability is not automatically guaranteed in such cases. As we have seen in this case, checking for Nokogiri errors could not have prevented the parser differential, but could have stopped at least one practical exploitation of it.The initial fix for the authentication bypasses does not remove one of the XML parsers to prevent API compatibility problems. As noted, the more fundamental issue was the disconnect between verification of the hash and verification of the signature, which was exploitable via parser differentials. The removal of one of the XML parsers was already planned for other reasons, and will likely come as part of a major release in combination with additional improvements to strengthen the library. If your company relies on open source software for business-critical functionality, consider sponsoring them to help fund their future development and bug fix releases.If you’re a user of ruby-saml library, make sure to update to the latest version, 1.18.0, containing fixes for CVE-2025-25291 and CVE-2025-25292. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml. We will publish a proof of concept exploit at a later date in the GitHub Security Lab repository.Special thanks to Sixto Martín, maintainer of ruby-saml, and Jeff Guerra from the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
Special thanks also to ahacker1 for giving inputs to this blog post.2024-11-04: Bug bounty report demonstrating an authentication bypass was reported against a GitHub test environment evaluating ruby-saml for SAML authentication.  2024-11-04: Work started to identify and test potential mitigations.  2024-11-12: A second authentication bypass was found by Peter that renders the planned mitigations for the first useless.  2024-11-13: Initial contact with Sixto Martín, maintainer of ruby-saml.  2024-11-14: Both parser differentials are reported to ruby-saml, the maintainer responds immediately.  2024-11-14: The work on potential patches by the maintainer and ahacker1 begins. (One of the initial ideas was to remove one of the XML parsers, but this was not feasible without breaking backwards compatibility).  2025-02-04: ahacker1 proposes a non-backwards compatible fix.  2025-02-06: ahacker1 also proposes a backwards compatible fix.  2025-02-12: The 90 days deadline of GitHub Security Lab advisories ends.  2025-02-16: The maintainer starts working on a fix with the idea to be backwards-compatible and easier to understand.  2025-02-17: Initial contact with GitLab to coordinate a release of their on-prem product with the release of the ruby-saml library.  2025-03-12: A fixed version of ruby-saml was released.Security Researcher at GitHub Security Lab]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to watch Nvidia GTC 2025, including CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/how-to-watch-nvidia-gtc-2025-including-ceo-jensen-huangs-keynote/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:59:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GTC, Nvidia’s biggest conference of the year, will return this week, with the biggest announcements probably coming Tuesday.

But while the cars obey speed limits and properly use their turn signals — they also "routinely violate parking rules."

Waymo vehicles driving themselves received 589 tickets for parking violations in 2024, according to records from San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency... The robots incurred $65,065 in fines for violations such as obstructing traffic, disobeying street cleaning restrictions and parking in prohibited areas... [Waymo is responsible for 0.05% of the city's fines, according to statistics from the article.] 

Parking violations are one of the few ways to quantify how often self-driving companies' vehicles break the rules of the road... Some parking violations, such as overstaying in a paid spot, cause inconvenience but do not directly endanger other people. Others increase the risk of crashes, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. Anytime a vehicle is obstructing the flow of traffic, other drivers might be forced to brake suddenly or change lanes, he said, creating risks for drivers, pedestrians or other road users... 

San Francisco transit operators lost 2 hours and 12 minutes of service time in 2024 because of Waymo vehicles blocking or colliding with transit vehicles, according to San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency records. Autonomous vehicles have obstructed firefighters responding to emergency scenes in San Francisco, triggering city officials to ask for tougher oversight from state regulators. 

The article adds that driverless Waymo vehicles in Los Angeles received 75 more tickets in 2024 — "with $543 in fines still outstanding, according to records from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>That Time I Recreated Photoshop in C++</title><link>https://f055.net/technology/that-time-i/that-time-i-recreated-photoshop-in-c/</link><author>f055</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:22:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As I’m getting older I look back on all the things I’ve done as a creative developer, and I see so many cool projects! But I never wrote down any development stories, and most of these projects, even as successful when released, got lost in time as years go by. That’s why I’m starting my new posts series „That time I” where I look back on my most interesting projects.The first one is about that time I recreated Photoshop in C++ and Windows API! I invite you to read my story and leave a comment with feedback, it’s hard to go on without your input 🙂Everything started in early summer of 2006. I was reading *a lot* of manga back then. But all the image reading apps sucked. Specifically, none of the apps allowed me to control my reading using just the mouse, and reaching my keyboard all the time was distracting. Since I just finished the C++/Windows API course at the uni, I spent the summer break coding my perfect manga reader. And I named it Fiew.Early autumn 2006 we returned to uni and had to decide on our final thesis for the degree. Writing the image viewer went smooth enough that I got the idea I could create an image editor as well. I was a heavy Adobe Photoshop user back then, so that became my goal. I mean, how hard can it be? Turns out, very.Over the course of the next several months, I wrote Advanced Image Editor named Fedit in C++ using Windows API and GDI+ graphic libraries. It followed a set of five rules to benefit the end user: no installers, no archives, no registry keys, no additional runtimes and a single executable file. The result was a program that was ready to work without the need of installation, could be run on systems with limited privileges (or straight from a thumb drive) and consumed small amounts of resources.I was very careful to make the interface look like classic Photoshop, and include all my most used features. So you had all the free floating windows with tools. The excellent colour picker. Easy layer management. Step-by-step reversible history. Several image filters, plus a matrix interface to encode your own pixel shifting filters too.Straight from my previous project named Fiew I added a massive image library viewer. It really could quickly and easily scroll through massive amounts of pictures.I had a lot of fun coding Fedit. And a lot of issues along the way. I spent a ton of time on MSDN and Stack Overflow, however that didn’t help that much since most of the issues were so specific I had to analyse and debug them on my own. But I worked like crazy on it, my motivation was immense. I had to make the bachelor thesis deadline, so for the final two-month stint I worked 14 hours a day.User interface was the most tricky bit. I wanted the workflow to resemble Photoshop as much as possible. The freely snapping-unsnapping of the tool settings pane was particularly hard. But no less than recreating the colour picker or the tool selector.By the time I finished I was pretty exhausted and kind of resenting WinAPI. But the thesis was a success and I received my Bachelor of Science in Engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology. Fedit received several positive reviews online but I didn’t promote it. Instead I took a well deserved holiday. A few months later thanks to the impression Fiew and Fedit made on the CTO of GoldenLine (Polish LinkedIn, market leader in its time, but now defunct), I landed a C++ job with a task to create extremely efficient WinAPI app to handle massive image uploading for a clone of Flickr. So in the end all that effort paid off.Fedit (and Fiew) source code is available on GitHub. The thesis documentation is available as PDF. The original website for these apps is still up on the Web Archive!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Orban accuses the EU of abusing its power in fiery speech commemorating Hungary’s Independence Day</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw0qj8gXSWk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mw0qj8gXSWk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:18:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, Viktor Orban held a speech at an Independence Day rally commemorating Hungary's revolution against the Austrian Empire on March 15th, 1848.

In 2012 Mann sued two bloggers for defamation — and last year Mann finally won more than $1 million, reports the Washington Post. "A jury found that two conservative commentators had defamed him by alleging that he was like a child molester in the way he had 'molested and tortured' climate data." 

But "Now, a year after that ruling, the case has taken a turn that leaves Mann in the position of the one who owes money."

 On Wednesday, a judge sanctioned Mann's legal team for "bad-faith trial misconduct" for overstating how much the scientist lost in potential grant funding as a result of reputational harm. The lawyers had shown jurors a chart that listed one grant amount Mann didn't get at $9.7 million, though in other testimony Mann said it was worth $112,000. And when comparing Mann's grant income before and after the negative commentary, the lawyers cited a disparity of $2.8 million, but an amended calculation pegged it at $2.37 million. 

The climate scientist's legal team said it was preparing to fight the setbacks in court. Peter J. Fontaine, one of Mann's attorneys, wrote in an email that Mann "believes that the court committed errors of fact and law and will pursue these matters further." Fontaine emphasized that the original decision — that Mann was defamed by the commentary — still stands. "We have reviewed the recent rulings by the D.C.

Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada’s plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets.The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each.A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada given the “changing environment,” or if there are better options.“At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft,” Laurent de Casanove said in a statement to CityNews. “The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs.”“To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract.” Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada. The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032. In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, “particularly where there may be opportunities” to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada.“The direction I’ve been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada,” he said.Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners “to see what is possible.”A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments. “Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future,” the company said in a statement.The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.On-again, off-again decision to buy F-35sThe Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition in 2010, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider.Then, in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35 at all.The government planned to buy 18 Super Hornets without a competition as an “interim” measure but cancelled the plan after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier.Ottawa initiated an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019.In January 2023, Canada announced it would buy the F-35 fighter jet with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.At the time, Defence Minister Anita Anand called the F-35 the best choice for Canada.A mixed fleet of planes ‘less disruptive, but costly and complex’Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued that Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them.He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should “cut its losses.”“We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems,” he said.Philippe Lagassé, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a “large scale transition underway” from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn’t only include the planes, but also the also the “infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America.”Lagassé, who also served as a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking.“It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time,” he said.Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane “would be less disruptive, but costly and complex.”The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion. A 2023 report estimated the acquisition phase would cost $19.8 billion, including $10.7 billion for 88 planes, $2.1 billion for weapons and ammunition and $5.9 billion for elements like design and depot costs, infrastructure and training.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cubans left in the dark after electrical grid fails | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_90BNmejGo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W_90BNmejGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 17:20:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cuba's national electrical grid collapsed late on Friday, leading to blackouts across the country.

Of course, the most important thing about that year is The Beatles landing in the United States and kicking off the British Invasion. But the year is endlessly discussed because so much else went on. The Rolling Stones released their debut albumMotown became a dominant force in pop music, releasing four number ones, three of which were by The SupremesBob Dylan dropped two albumsThe Beach Boys continued their run of hits“Everybody Loves Somebody” by Dean Martin“Where Did Our Love Go” by The Supremes“A Hard Day’s Night” by The Beatles“Rag Doll” by Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons“Under the Boardwalk” by The DriftersThese are five songs that I return to often. And weeks like this weren’t even that rare in 1964. Just one week later, you had the same songs in the top five, except “Rag Doll” was replaced by The Animals’ “House of the Rising Son,” the song that some claim made Dylan go electric and pushed rock music into a completely new direction.The one claim that’s always fascinated me about 1964 is that it was a line of demarcation between an old and a new way to make music. If you were making hits in 1963 and didn’t change your sound in 1964, you were going to be waiting tables by the beginning of 1965. In other words, The Beatles-led British Invasion decimated the careers of scores of artists. But was this really the case?To do this, I grabbed a list of all 175 acts who released at least one top 40 single in 1963. (Fun fact: the record for the most top 40 hits that year was shared by five acts: Bobby Vinton, Brenda Lee, Dion & the Belmonts, Ray Charles, and The Beach Boys. Each had six top 40 hits.) I then decided to see which of those acts never released a hit in 1964 or any year after. In total, 88 of those 175 acts, or 50%, never had a top 40 hit again. That’s kind of a lot. In other words, The Beatles and their fellow invading Brits killed a lot of careers. Or did they? By looking at only a single year we could be biased. And we are.If we calculate that same rate for every single year between 1960 and 2020, we see that while the kill rate in 1964 was high, it wasn’t completely out of the ordinary. The median is around 40%. Having a multi-year career as a popular artist is just hard. By looking at the years with the highest rates, we can glean a few other things, though.First, three of the top ten rates are 1962, 1963, and 1964. In other words, there is some credence to the theory that the British Invasion decimated many careers. Nevertheless, the fact that the rates in 1962 and 1963 are high tells me that sonic changes were brewing in the United States too. Had The Beatles not arrived, rock music probably still would have evolved in a way that would have left earlier hitmakers in the dust. That sonic evolution would have been different, though.changed their chart methodologyearlier newsletterIn other words, the 1990s were strange. And I think we are just beginning to grapple with that strangeness. Because of that, there was a ton of turnover on the charts. It’s hard for artists to keep up with trends when grunge, gangsta rap, swing, and a new breed of teen pop are all successful in a matter of years. Being a superstar isn’t easy.Aggregating this data got me thinking about which artists have been able to survive the most musical changes and still find success. While there are artists, like Elton John and The Rolling Stones, who put out hits for decades, I want to point out one artist whose resilience still shocks me: Frankie Valli. Born in 1934, Valli had his first major hit in 1962 with “Sherry,” a song performed with his group The Four Seasons. Before The Beatles splashed on American shores, Valli and his bandmates had eight more top 40 hits. But they were the kind of group that you’d expect to be decimated by the new sound of rock music. The Four Seasons were sort of a throwback even in 1963, Valli and his falsetto pointing toward the doo-wop of the last decade.But Valli and his collaborators forged on. They made some musical missteps but they remained a musical force through 1967, releasing bonafide classics, like “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.” Okay. So, he survived the British Invasion. Some others did too. But Valli didn’t go quietly as the 1960s came to a close. In 1974, he scored a massive hit with “My Eyes Adored You,” a song that played well with the soft rock that was dominant at the time. Then disco began to boom and Valli remained undeterred. “Swearin' to God.” “Who Loves You.” “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night).” The man could not be stopped.A New OneAlligator Bites Never Heal An Old OneAs I was admiring 1964, I noticed that the week of October 10 had a mind-blowing top five. It included Roy Orbison’s “Oh, Pretty Woman,” Manfred Mann’s “Do Wah Diddy Diddy,” Martha & the Vandellas’ “Dancing in the Street,” and The Shangri-Las’ “Remember (Walkin’ in the Sand).” There was one song that I wasn’t familiar with, though: “Bread and Butter” by The Newbeats.“Bread and Butter” is fun, little novelty about bread, butter, toast, jam, and losing your lover. The most notable thing about the song is a half-screamed falsetto that appears periodically throughout the song as performed by Larry Henley. Incidentally, Henley is another good example of musical resilience. After his performing career ended, he wrote a few hits over the decades, including Bette Midler’s massive 1989 ballad “Wind Beneath My Wings.”Shout out to the paid subscribers who allow this newsletter to exist.

Video filmed by CNN in the capital Havana showed streets and buildings shrouded in total darkness, as people used electric torches to navigate the streets. By Saturday morning, the Cuban government officials said that "microsystems" — pockets of electricity — had been restored in some cities. However, it remains unclear when the island's power system would be fully online again and most people remained in the dark... 

It marks the latest in a series of failures on the Caribbean island struggling with creaking infrastructure, natural disasters and economic turmoil... For nearly a week in October, most of Cuba suffered near-total blackouts, the worst energy outages in decades. While Cubans are used to frequent power outages, to have another nationwide backcourt — the fourth in six months — was unsettling for many people who need electricity to cook and refrigerate food that otherwise spoils quickly in the tropical heat.

We've landed two big changes in rust-analyzer this past week: - A Salsa upgrade. Today, this should  improve performance, but in the near future, the new Salsa will allow us do features like parallel autocomplete and persistent caches. This work also unblocks us from using the Rust compiler's new trait solver! - Salsa-ification of the crate graph, which changed the unit of incrementality to an individual crate from the entire crate graph. This finer-grained incrementality means that actions that'd previously invalidate the entire crate graph (such as adding/removing a dependency or editing a build script/proc macro) will now cause rust-analyzer to  reindex the changed crate(s),  the entire workspace.While we're pretty darn confident in these changes, these are big changes, so we'd appriciate some testing from y'all!If you're using Visual Studio Code: 1. Open the "Extensions" view () on a Mac;  on other platforms. 2. Find and open the "rust-analyzer extension". 3. Assuming it is installed, and click the button that says "Switch to Pre-Release Version". VS Code should install a nightly rust-analyzer and prompt you to reload extensions. 4. Let us know if anything's off!Other Editors/Building From Source(Note that rust-analyzer compiles on the latest stable Rust! You do not need a nightly.)git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer.git. Make sure you're on the latest commit!cargo xtask install --server --jemalloc. This will build and place rust-analyzer into into ~/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer.Update your your editor to point to that new path. in VS Code, the setting is rust-analyzer.server.path, other editors have some way to override the path.

              My personal candidate for Go’s  historical mistake is that of multiple return values,
              exactly because of how harmless they look.
              Multiple return values influenced the design of the language (in bad ways), interact poorly with other
              features, and make the language much more complex than it has to be.
            Exhibit A, multiple return values:Looking at this, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Go has ’tuples’ (like Python or Rust).
              It doesn’t. There’s no such thing as a ’tuple’. All Go has is a special case syntax which allows functions
              to return multiple values at the same time. If you want something that sort of behaves like a tuple in Go,
              you need to define a struct.
              There’s a few other cases of this ‘multiple return values’ behavior special cased for the built-in
               operator or when accessing a value from a map or channel.
            
              What I’m complaining about in this screed is that—as a consequence of putting multiple return values into
              the language and not making them a dedicated tuple type—Go is in a worse state than it had to be, and that
              all of this was completely avoidable.
            
              When I use other languages, I tend to be  that whatever one of my functions spits
              out, I can put it into a list or vector.
            
              Through the power of Go, it’s impossible to  pass data around without additional ceremony. I
              can’t overstate how  it is that in the world of Go, calling a function and being able to
              store the result in a list is the exception, and not the rule.
            
              This (of course) doesn’t compile since  is not a type. Tuples don’t exist. So
              you  get used to first refactoring all of your functions and defining a whole new struct
              just to pass some data around. Maybe use two lists? Or a new struct? Amazing.
            This gets significantly more annoying once you try to go concurrent.
              Imagine that you want to spin up some goroutines, have each call
              func doStuff() (string, error), and then gather the results. You  pass
               through a channel since it’s not a standalone type. The usual workaround is
              to do
              whatever this is
              or to
              define a custom struct:
            
              Let me repeat this: Go—a language famous for its concurrency and uncompromising errors-as-values
              approach—requires you to define a non-standard wrapper type to handle errors as soon as its most basic
              synchronization primitive is involved or to store  in a slice.
            In other words, Go’s error handling and concurrency don’t compose.Hell, even Go’s built-in containers and error handling don’t compose!
              Like many of Go’s problems, it’s something you can work around, but I don’t think that that’s much of an
              excuse.
            
              The whole idea behind Go’s error handling is that . You can pass them around
              like values, inspect them like values, and they’re handled using the same control flow constructs as
              everything else.
            
              So despite errors being values, the return of a function call is  not a value at all.
              You can’t pass it around, you can’t store it.
            
              A friend of mine has suggested that he believes that “Rob Pike invented Go as a practical joke.”. That’s a
              pretty rough way too put it, but I can’t entirely blame him? Why would you design a language where the
              result of a function call cannot be stored or passed around?
            
              The problem is that this situation was avoidable—if anyone had thought about this in slightly more detail
              back in the earliest design days—it would’ve been easy to just promote multiple return values to anonymous
              structs. Instead that time was, presumably, spent adding nonsense like
              named return values.
            
              This is about . Nothing is ‘simple’ about the fact that calling a function doesn’t
              return a value. It’s a weird idiosyncrasy. By trying to make the language ‘simple’, you played yourself
              and added a weird edge case.
            Iterators and ‘Range over Functions’Here’s a basic example of ranging over functions:
              Just create a constructor function which returns a function which captures variables from the enclosing
              function scope, and uses them to decide when to call its argument function, thereby determining the
              behavior of the loop for the end-user. Nothing could possibly be easier. (That’s sarcasm. I find this code
              hard to read and would’ve preferred an interface-based approach.)
            The Go standard library defines the following types and functions as part of this release:
              Go cannot handle the case of iterating over one or two values in a uniform, parametrized way. It requires
              , one for handling one value at a time, and one for two values.
            
              Because Go doesn’t have ’tuples’. Why doesn’t Go have tuples? I don’t know—There were
              some vague discussions in 2009, but it just looks like the Go developers didn’t think of the feature as particularly important. Keeping
              the language ‘small’ was the higher priority for them.
            
              Again: This was an attempt to keep the language ‘simple’ which
              now results in weird, complex edge cases and having to learn twice as many APIs. Congratulations,
              you tried to simplify and instead just played yourself.
            
              (Back in the day Go didn’t have generics. Designing a language that interacts poorly with generics under
              the assumption they’ll never be added was a design tradeoff that probably made sense at the time. Funfact:
              Go took 5 years until it’s 1.0 release. Rust needed 9 years, and Zig still isn’t there.)
            
              Take a step back to think about what this means: The designers of the standard library are forced to
              hardcode specific instances of a type because the language is unable to sufficiently abstract over whether
              you’re handling one or two values at a time.
            
              Again: This is not a hard technical problem. There  solutions for this. It’s not even hard if
              you design a language from the get-go. Go just didn’t implement them.
            
              Consider what this means for Go’s library ecosystem. If even the standard library easily runs into
              situations where it’s necessary to work around this limitation, how hard do you think it is a
              library that does anything slightly fancier? (Again, this limitation extends to error handling, since
              error handling happens through multiple return values.)
            Warning: Hot opinions ahead, and a bunch of speculation.
              Go’s multiple return value-based error handling was considered to be “good enough”, and prevented the
              development of a better approach to error handling.
            
              In reality that could’ve gone either way: The Go developers considered enums and or-operators to be such
              mysterious, advanced features that there’s no guarantees Go would have ended up with
              -type based error handling even if multiple return values had never made it into the
              language.
            For all we know we’d have “Go with exceptions”, which would probably be a step backwards.
              Still: I’ll stand by the fact that multiple return values were a classic ‘worse is better’-type solution
              that prevented the Go developers from ever  anything even slightly more nuanced,
              like a
              Result type (aka a sum
              type purely for error handling, i.e. a value which is either a result  an error).
            
              Instead, we’re stuck with multiple return values-based error handling. I’m sure you’ve seen people
              complain about the issues with accidental shadowing of variables. Those make it pretty easy to
              accidentally forget to check errors. Not a big deal but (once again, this is a running theme here)
              entirely unnecessary.
            
              Or taking an example from
              here, that code like this compiles:
            Or the fact that, no, there’s nothing that stops you from writing functions like this here:Is this bad? Well, it’s by design.
              I am not saying Go’s error handling is . It’s okay. It’s decisively mid-tier, which is a
              bit embarrassing for a modern green-field project. They had an opportunity to do better than this, and
              they blew it, and  of these issues are downstream of the decision to standardize on
              multiple return values as the idiomatic way to handle errors.
            
              I’ll put my own take on what Go’s error handling should have been like in here since it’s my blog post and
              you cannot stop me. I’m sure some people will heavily disagree. That’s fine. I think that if Go had
              standardized around this approach to error handling everyone would’ve gotten used to it.
            
              Simple, just define a  type that has a  method or operator
              defined on it that either just passes the value or (if an error is present) wraps it and
              returns from the function.
              You can bikeshed the hell out of this one. Make it a postfix operator instead of a method, if you want.
              Write  or  to make it stand out more, I don’t care.
            Vastly better interactions with generics.
                Allows you to store  in slices and pass it around however you please.
              Better for static analysis.Less verbose, if you care about that. (I honestly don’t.)There’s not even a need for sum types if you don’t want them.
              In practice, it’s too late for invasive changes like that: Go has standardized on multiple return values
              for error handling, and trying to move away from that would be a fool’s errand.
            
              Since trying to move towards sum-type-based error handling is a nonstarter unless we want to split the
              language, let’s ask the obvious question: Is there anything that can be done to improve any of the issues
              outlined in this post?
            Can we at least promote multiple return values to full blown types and allow generics over them?Maybe. That’d be cool. I think it’d be an improvement.
              It’s not entirely trivial though, so let me write down some reasons why it’d be hard, and the changes
              that’d have to be made.
            
              You might say “But doesn’t Go have strong backwards compatibility guarantees?” Yeah, it does. That’s what
              makes it hard. If you could just change stuff however you want, it’d be easy.
            
              That said, even Go 1.22 made a pretty
              significant change. You can get pretty far as long as you’re willing to say “Old code will continue to
              mean exactly what it means today: the fix only applies to new or updated code.”,  you provide
              tools to auto-fix code during a migration from Go 1.N to Go 1.(N+1).
            In other words, it doesn’t sound impossible.
              In Go, multiple return values are ‘unpacked’ via . This makes the following
              code syntactically ambiguous due to the optional presence value you can extract from maps:
            
              Is this a problem? Eeeeh. It looks like one, but it’s to resolve by just picking one. Since tuples don’t
              exist in previous versions of Go, old code is just not affected.
            Multiple Return Value passingPassing multiple return values to a variadic function is currently legal Go code:
              Does this pass the tuple  to bar as the first argument, or does it automatically unpack
               to pass the fields as first and second argument?
            
              Moving away from auto-unpacking would be a breaking change, but if we don’t move away from it then
              .
            
              The modern solution to that is pretty simple: First, allow tuples to be unpacked like slices are (i.e. you
              have to write  to unpack the tuple). Second, add  and
               commands that identify this issue and fix it when upgrading to the most recent edition
              of Go.
            
              Honestly? I thought this would be hard, but as far as language changes go, this seems pretty easy, all
              things considered.
            
              If you want to dig deeper into this, you can find
              a bunch of
              similar Github
              issues on these topics. I stumbled
              upon them when doing research for this blog, I’ve not participated in any of them.
            Maybe I should, though. It would be  to see this one issue finally resolved.
              I don’t know for sure how Go ended up in this weird state with ‘multiple return values’, where it’s
              impossible to pass function results through a channel or into a slice.
            That one is still baffling to me, so here’s me trying to make sense of it.
              My understanding is that multiple return values were part of Go before its public release. Even in the
              Weekly Snapshot History that goes all the
              way back to 2009, there’s only a single mention of multiple return values way back in 2010: “cgo: correct
              multiple return value function invocations (thanks Christian Himpel)”.I imagine the situation played out as follows:
              First of all, multiple return values entered the language . Perhaps via the
               operator, since someone figured that using a traditional
              for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)-style loop just to iterate over the elements of an array or
              map is too error prone, or perhaps just as a convenience feature.
            
              Then, the gates of hell opened, demons attacked and the world of programming was set back—no, sorry, I am
              kidding.
            
              I assume that what actually happened is that multiple return values were just  and
              quickly became the idiomatic ‘gold-standard’ for error handling, passing values around, and so on.
            
              At this point I’m sure that someone asked “Hey, why don’t we just promote those to a full-blown tuple
              type?”, and was shot down with something like “We already have . There should be a
              single way of doing things. Go is a simple language. Why would we want to have two features that do the
              same thing?”
            
              In either case, at this point multiple return values were here to stay, and the feature established itself
              as the standard for error handling.
            
              Looking at the oldest internal discussions in Google’s ‘Golang Nuts’ group (just one or three days after
              the first
              announcement)
              is interesting. Say
              here or
              here. I
              mean it! Go and take a look. Lines such as “Go doesn’t have nullable types, we haven’t seen a lot of
              demand for them” really puts things into perspective.
            
              Give it a few years and we enter the present day, and Go is struggling with some of its earliest design
              decisions. (Evidence: This entire post. Also,
              generic methods are still
              impossible.)
            
              Go has these weird special cases (e.g. multiple return values, named return values), decided that ‘and’
              and ‘or’ are close enough (they even made that mistake twice), and many of these problems were intentional design decisions or avoidable.
            
              The ‘avoidable’ part is a big deal for me. It just feels like a lot of pain could’ve been avoided if Go
              had spent slightly more time thinking about programming language design.
            
              Going out on a limb, to me it looks like many of the issues boil down to the question of whether you take
              types seriously, and are willing to dig into the bare minimum of abstractions to figure out how certain
              features need to be designed, instead of just making things up as you ™.
            
              I don’t want to shill for Rust , but one thing that language did well is that it
               and designed itself around its type system.
             is how it got memory safety without a garbage collector. By
              moving that information to the type system. This is exactly, intentionally the road that Go
              didn’t pick.
            
              Go instead got…multiple return values, which are specifically, intentionally
              not a type in their own right to keep the language simple. I think this was a bad decision. When
              it’s easy to codify an abstraction as a type, you  codify it as a type. Go is still
              learning that lesson today.
            
              To go out on a positive note—I just spent a whole post complaining about Go, after all—I think that Go is
              an impressive technical achievement, and set the modern gold standard as far as tooling goes. I am
              grateful for that. I also really have to respect that its simplicity keeps perfectionism at bay.
            
              Someday I want to write a post about what I like about Go, but that day is not today. I’ll cross my
              fingers that tuples are going to be on the list by then.

InfoWorld writes that "The initiative promises dramatic improvements in editor startup speed, build times, and memory usage, making it easier to scale TypeScript to large code bases, Microsoft said."

Microsoft's TypeScript team expects to be able to preview command-line type-checking in Go-based tsc by mid-2025, and to deliver a feature-complete Go implementation of TypeScript by the end of the year. [You can build and run the Go code now from Microsoft's new working repository.]
 Developers who use Go-based TypeScript in the Visual Studio Code editor will feel the increased speed in the editor, Microsoft said. The company promises an 8x improvement in project load times, instant comprehensive error listings across entire projects, and greater responsiveness for all language service operations including completion lists, quick information, go to definition, and find all references. The new TypeScript will also support more advanced refactoring and deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute, the company said. 

Microsoft believes native Go implementations reduce build times by up to 10x, notes Neowin. But "Developers can expect TypeScript 6.0 to have some deprecations and breaking changes to support the upcoming Go-based version."

Later this year, Microsoft will be releasing this new native Go implementation as TypeScript 7.0. The current JS-based TypeScript codebase will continue development into the 6.x series until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption, since some projects may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other things that are not supported by TypeScript 7+. 
TypeScript's original creator Anders Hejlsberg recorded an announcement video — and also shared his thoughts in a GitHub discussion titled simply... "Why Go?"
The TypeScript compiler's move to Go was influenced by specific technical requirements, such as the need for structural compatibility with the existing JavaScript-based codebase, ease of memory management, and the ability to handle complex graph processing efficiently. After evaluating numerous languages and making multiple prototypes — including in C# — Go emerged as the optimal choice... 
Let's be real. Microsoft using Go to write a compiler for TypeScript wouldn't have been possible or conceivable in years past. However, over the last few decades, we've seen Microsoft's strong and ongoing commitment to open-source software, prioritizing developer productivity and community collaboration above all. Our goal is to empower developers with the best tools available, unencumbered by internal politics or narrow constraints. This freedom to choose the right tool for each specific job ultimately benefits the entire developer community, driving innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes. And you can't argue with a 10x outcome! 

Hejlsberg also addressed their choice of Go in an online interview with the Michigan TypeScript meetup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Fashion Shopping with Nearest Neighbors</title><link>https://vibewall.shop/</link><author>unixpickle</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:33:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An error has occurred while loading the content.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Milk Kanban</title><link>https://brodzinski.com/2025/03/milk-kanban.html</link><author>ladronevincet</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:32:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When people say Kanban, they tend to think of a specific set of practices. Whiteboards & sticky notes (both almost universally virtual). Tasks moving through columns that represent workflow. Every now and then, WIP limits even.As often as we do it with other things, it reduces a broader principle to a set of oversimplified techniques, which, in turn, tend to underdeliver in many contexts.In its original meaning, Kanban represented a visual signal. The thing that communicated, well, something. It might have been a need, option, availability, capacity, request, etc.In our Kanban systems, the actual Kanban is a sticky note.It represents work, and given its closest environment (board, columns, other stickies, visual decorators), it communicates what needs, or needs not, to be done.If it’s yellow, it’s a regular feature. If there’s a blocker on it, it requests focus. If there’s a long queue of neighbors, it suggests flow inefficiency. If it’s a column named “ready for…” it communicates available work and/or handoff.A visual signal all the way.Let’s decouple ourselves from the most standard Kanban board design. Let’s forget columns, sticky notes, and all that jazz.Enters Kasia, our office manager at Lunar. One of the many things Kasia takes care of is making sure we don’t run out of kitchen supplies. The tricky part is that when you don’t drink milk yourself, it becomes a pain to check the cupboard with milk reserves every now and then to ensure we’re stocked.Then, one day, I found this.A simple index card taped to the last milk carton in a row stating, “Bring me to Kasia.” That’s it.In the context, it really says that:we’re running out of (specific kind of) milkthere’s enough time to make an order (we don’t drink that much of cappuccinos and macchiatos)But it’s just a visual signal. Kanban at its very core.What Kasia designed is a perfect Kanban system. It relies on visual signals, which are put in the context. Even better, unlike most Kanban boards I see across teams, the system is self-explanatory. Everything one needs to know is written on the index card.It’s a safe assumption that, almost always, there’s a simpler visualization that would work just as well. We, process designers, often fall into the trap of overengineering our tools.And it’s a healthy wake-up call when someone who knows close to nothing about our fancy stuff designs a system that we would unlikely think of. One that is a perfect implementation of the original spirit, even if it doesn’t follow any of the common techniques.That’s what we can learn from Milk Kanban.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpaceX launches astronauts for long-awaited International Space Station crew swap</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/spacex-launches-astronauts-for-long-awaited-international-space-station-crew-swap/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:13:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SpaceX successfully launched four people into space on Friday, beginning a mission that will give the International Space Station enough crew members to allow astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to return to Earth after their nine-month stay.

No? Think again. Have you noticed conflicting updates to the same data?In distributed systems, coordination is crucial. A distributed lock ensures that if one actor (node, service instance, etc.) changes a shared resource—like a database record, file, or external service—no other node can step in until the first node is finished.Today, we’ll try to discuss it and:By the end, you should have a decent grasp of distributed locks, enough to make informed decisions about whether (and how) to use them in your architecture.who’s in charge of updating shared data?For example, you might have:Multiple Writers are updating the same table row.That’s a common issue when updating read models.Without locks, you can get unpredictable states - like a read model flipping from correct to incorrect or a file partially overwritten by multiple workers. Locks sacrifice a bit of parallelism for the certainty that no two nodes update the same resource simultaneously. In many cases, that’s the safest trade-off, especially if data correctness is paramount.idempotent actionswrite-ahead logsIf no lock currently exists, the node creates one, for instance by setting a Redis key with a time-to-live or by creating an ephemeral zNode in ZooKeeper.If another node is holding the lock, this node either waits, fails immediately, or retries, depending on your chosen policy.Crash or Automatic ReleaseThe basic flow would look like:And the acquisition part with TTL handling:There are many tools for distributed locking; let's check the most popular for certain categories.Kubernetes Single-InstanceDistributed locks all share a common goal: ensure only one node does a particular thing at any given time. However, each tool mentioned approaches the problem with distinct designs, strengths, and failover behaviours.Let’s look at each tool’s big-picture purpose—why you’d even consider it—then move on to how it implements (or approximates) a lock. Lastly, let’s discuss a few technical details that matter once you start coding or troubleshooting.Redis runs all commands in a single thread, so there is no risk of two commands interfering partway through.Redis runs all commands in a single thread, so there is no risk of two commands interfering partway through. To create a lock, you need to create a “lock key” using a Redis command, for instance:SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30That looks cryptic, but let’s see what’s happening behind the scenes:Atomic Key Creation with NX. SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30SET lockKey node123 NX EX 30Handling Network Partitions. Redlock algorithmChoosing Redis may be a good option if you already run a Redis cluster for caching or need a lightweight solution that’s easy to integrate. Performance is generally good, though absolute consistency under partitions can require more complex setups.ZooKeeper and etcd each run as a cluster of nodes that keep data consistent across a majority of them (a quorum).You create something like  in ZooKeeper or a key in etcd.When you’re done, you delete the ephemeral node or lease key, signalling that source is available.Other clients can “watch” that lock path. If the lock holder crashes, ZooKeeper or etcd detects the session loss and removes the node, instantly notifying watchers that the lock is free again. This allows any waiting client to move in and grab the lock right away.If a node is isolated from the quorum, ZooKeeper or etcd eventually considers that session dead and removes the ephemeral node. This auto-frees the lock. The newly updated cluster state reflects that the lock is available, so another node can pick it up.If your environment already depends on them for cluster metadata or leader election, reusing them for locks is natural. They replicate data across multiple servers, so updates to the lock state are consistent, reducing the risk of split-brain scenarios. The ephemeral mechanism automatically frees locks if a session dies, so you don’t end up with “zombie” locks after crashes.They offer stronger consistency guarantees at the cost of heavier operational overhead compared to Redis.Sometimes you’d rather avoid setting up additional infrastructure, like Redis or ZooKeeper, and simply rely on the single relational database you already use. Many SQL databases—PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and others—provide built-in locking features that can help you coordinate concurrency directly in your existing environment. There are generally two ways to handle locks in a relational database: “I want exclusive access to something”They serve different needs, but both let you say, “I want exclusive access to something,” using your existing DB.You can lock specific rows in a table by issuing something like:BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM locks WHERE lock_id = @loc_key FOR UPDATE;
/* make changes */
COMMIT;
That looks cryptic, but here’s what’s happening. “Lock this row so nobody else can modify it until I’m done.”The lock lasts until you commit or roll back the transaction.You may also use regular rows instead of a dedicated locks table. It’s natural if your concurrency problem revolves around specific table rows. For others you need to define key that would represent the scope of locking-- PostgreSQL
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(12345);
/* do something exclusive */
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(12345);
-- MySQL
SELECT GET_LOCK('readModel', 10);
/* do something exclusive */
SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('readModel');
PostgreSQL Advisory LocksIn many cases, database locks require minimal setup. There’s no need to spin up Redis or ZooKeeper if you already trust a single relational DB for everything. You can use familiar SQL, which can benefit many developers. You get transaction integrations.Still, they’re tight to a single database scope.The other downside is lock contention.You also can get deadlocksSometimes, you don’t need a distributed lock at all—you just need to ensure there’s no possibility of concurrency. In Kubernetes, you can tell the cluster to run exactly one replica of your service. With only one pod, you don’t risk two pods writing to the same resource simultaneously. This approach is straightforward but also very limiting.StatefulSetNo Parallelism or scalingetcdetcdIn Kubernetes, the mechanisms and controllers designed to manage the number of pods are quite robust, but in highly dynamic or unusual situations, there might be brief moments where conditions could lead to more than one pod being created temporarily.Rapid Scale-Up and Scale-Down:Network Partitions or etcd Availability Issues:Why You’d Choose Single-Instance in Kubernetes?If you just need to enforce that there’s a single instance processing background job (read model handling, job processing) and you have Kubernetes set up, then it’s a decent choice. You remove the concurrency at all. You don’t spin up Redis or ZooKeeper just to handle locks.Still, the race conditions can be dangerous for high traffic or important cases. It’s not fully reliable.Here’s my recommended decision-making scheme for locking mechanism:If you have a single relational DB handling all app state, advisory locks might sufficeIf your environment already includes a Redis cluster for caching and you want a simpler ephemeral lock, Redis is a natural fit.If concurrency is never desired or is completely out of scope for a specific microservice, AND you’re using already Kubernetes a single-instance Kubernetes approach may be acceptable.If your microservices need advanced coordination (like leader election, watchers, or strongly consistent state), consider ZooKeeper or etcd. If your system needs to acquire multiple locks at once, you risk deadlocks (e.g., process A has Lock1 and wants Lock2; process B has Lock2 and wants Lock1). The best practice is to lock in a consistent order globally or use carefully designed transaction boundaries. I’ll show you next week how you could use queuing and single writer for that.Locks serialize access. If too many services fight for the same lock, your system effectively becomes single-threaded. To avoid bottlenecks, lock only the smallest critical sections. If concurrency at some granularity is acceptable, consider sharding or partitioned locks.If you rely on a single Redis instance or a single ZooKeeper node, your lock manager can fail. Always consider using a clustered or highly available setup, such as Redis with sentinel or cluster mode or a ZooKeeper ensemble of three or five nodes.Systems like Redlock try to handle partial failures, but no distributed lock can be 100% guaranteed if your network is severely partitioned (CAP theorem territory). You might end up with multiple holders, each believing they’re the only one. Proper design, timeouts, and conflict detection help reduce these edge cases.Try to avoid distributed locking if you can. Distributed systems will always have complexities, but a well-implemented distributed lock (or a strategic single-instance approach) can tame the chaos of concurrency—keeping your data consistent and your architecture stable.What are your experiences, use cases, and challenges with distributed locking?And hey, all the best for Christmas if you celebrate it. If you don’t, try to also get the chance to rest a bit. And if you  don’t want to, that’s fine, as long as you’re happy!p.s. Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion.

"The two renewable energy sources accounted for 17% of the country's power mix while coal fell to a low of 15%, it said."

Solar was the fastest-growing energy source, according to Ember's analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, increasing 27% from the year before, while wind rose 7%... Natural gas generation increased 3.3% in 2024, according to Ember, and remains by far the largest source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for 43% of the mix... 
California and Nevada both surpassed 30% annual share of solar in their electricity mix for the first time last year (32% and 30%, respectively). California's battery growth was key to its solar success. It installed 20% more battery capacity than it did solar capacity, which helped it transfer a significant share of its daytime solar to the evening. Texas installed more solar and battery capacity than even California. 

Yet the growth of solar was uneven — 28 states generated less than 5% of their electricity from solar in 2024, highlighting significant untapped potential — even before adding battery storage. 
The article includes this observation from Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember. "The fall in battery costs is a gamechanger for how much solar the U.S. electricity grid could integrate in the near future." 

Electrek notes that "After being stagnant for 14 years, electricity demand started rising in recent years and saw a 3% increase in 2024, marking the fifth-highest level of rise this century..."

Natural gas grew three times more than the decline in coal, increasing power sector CO2 emissions slightly (0.7%). Coal fell by the second smallest amount since 2014, as gas and clean energy growth met rising electricity demand, whereas historically, they have replaced coal. Despite growing emissions, the carbon intensity of electricity continued to decline. The rise in power demand was much faster than the rise in power sector CO2 emissions, making each unit of electricity likely the cleanest it has ever been.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUs</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gpu-powered-akira-ransomware-decryptor-released-on-github/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 14:16:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security researcher Yohanes Nugroho has released a decryptor for the Linux variant of Akira ransomware, which utilizes GPU power to retrieve the decryption key and unlock files for free.

So far, Merz has seen a lot of advance praise, but how will his ambition to turn Germany from a “hesitant” to a “leading middle power” really be felt in Europe. How will he shape German relations with other EU countries? Will he get along with the European Commission?

It's also helped usher in political newcomer Mark Carney as the new Canadian prime minister and opened a window for Ontario's premier Doug Ford to step into the global conversation.

Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

In this scam, dubbed “,” the visitor to a hacked or malicious website is asked to distinguish themselves from bots by pressing a combination of keyboard keys that causes  to download password-stealing malware.ClickFix attacks mimic the “Verify You are a Human” tests that many websites use to separate real visitors from content-scraping bots. This particular scam usually starts with a website popup that looks something like this:This malware attack pretends to be a CAPTCHA intended to separate humans from bots.Clicking the “I’m not a robot” button generates a pop-up message asking the user to take three sequential steps to prove their humanity.Executing this series of keypresses prompts Windows to download password-stealing malware.Step 1 involves simultaneously pressing the keyboard key with the Windows icon and the letter “R,” which opens a Windows “Run” prompt that will execute any specified program that is already installed on the system.Step 2 asks the user to press the “CTRL” key and the letter “V” at the same time, which pastes malicious code from the site’s virtual clipboard.Step 3 — pressing the “Enter” key — causes Windows to download and launch malicious code through “,” a Windows program designed to run Microsoft HTML application files.“This campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT,”  wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.”According to Microsoft, hospitality workers are being tricked into downloading credential-stealing malware by cybercriminals impersonating . The company said attackers have been sending malicious emails impersonating Booking.com, often referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, or online promotion opportunities — all in a bid to convince people to step through one of these ClickFix attacks.In November 2024, KrebsOnSecurity reported that hundreds of hotels that use booking.com had been subject to targeted phishing attacks. Some of those lures worked, and allowed thieves to gain control over booking.com accounts. From there, they sent out phishing messages asking for financial information from people who’d just booked travel through the company’s app.Earlier this month, the security firm warned about ClickFix attacks targeting people working in the healthcare sector. The company said those attacks leveraged malicious code stitched into the widely used physical therapy video site HEP2go that redirected visitors to a ClickFix prompt.An alert (PDF) released in October 2024 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that the ClickFix attack can take many forms, including fake  error pages and popups that spoof .ClickFix tactic used by malicious websites impersonating Google Chrome, Facebook, PDFSimpli, and reCAPTCHA. Source: Sekoia.The ClickFix attack — and its reliance on mshta.exe — is reminiscent of phishing techniques employed for years that hid exploits inside . Malicious macros became such a common malware threat that Microsoft was forced to start blocking macros by default in Office documents that try to download content from the web.Alas, the email security vendor  has documented plenty of ClickFix attacks via phishing emails that include HTML attachments spoofing Microsoft Office files. When opened, the attachment displays an image of Microsoft Word document with a pop-up error message directing users to click the “Solution” or “How to Fix” button.HTML files containing ClickFix instructions. Examples for attachments named “Report_” (on the left) and “scan_doc_” (on the right). Image: Proofpoint.Organizations that wish to do so can take advantage of Microsoft Group Policy restrictions to prevent Windows from executing the “run” command when users hit the Windows key and the “R” key simultaneously.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Republican Congressman Jim Jordan asks Big Tech if Biden tried to censor AI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/republican-congressman-jim-jordan-asks-big-tech-if-biden-tried-to-censor-ai/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:12:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent letters to 16 American technology firms, including Google and OpenAI, asking for past communications with the Biden administration that might suggest the former president “coerced or colluded” with companies to “censor lawful speech” in AI products.

The researchers were initially astonished by how effectively some of their interpretability methods seemed to uncover these hidden training objectives, although the methods are still under research.While the research involved models trained specifically to conceal information from automated software evaluators called reward models (RMs), the broader purpose of studying hidden objectives is to prevent future scenarios where AI systems might deceive or manipulate human users.While training a language model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reward models are typically tuned to score AI responses according to how well they align with human preferences. However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google is replacing Google Assistant with Gemini</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/google-is-replacing-google-assistant-with-gemini/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:49:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google will replace Google Assistant on Android phones with Gemini later this year, the company announced on Friday.

Why is an ‘open’ future controversial among theologians? If the future is not ‘settled’, if there is no certainty from God’s viewpoint of how future events will turn out, then God’s providence, could not be as sure. If the future is truly open, then not even God could know the future because there are no future facts to know.

Agnostics do not know whether or not God exists. Theists surmise they’re reprobates. Atheists suppose they’re cowards. Are there different kinds of agnostics? Can agnosticism deepen appreciation for God—what it would take to believe in God and what it would mean if indeed there were a God? A robust, energetic agnosticism is a credit to God if there is one.

NVIDIA, for instance, developed some of the most advanced high-performance computing (HPC) libraries, creating a competitive moat that has proven difficult for others to breach.But what if a couple of students, within a few months, could compete with state-of-the-art HPC libraries with a few hundred lines of code, instead of tens or hundreds of thousands?That’s what researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have shown with a new programming language called Exo 2.Exo 2 belongs to a new category of programming languages that MIT Professor Jonathan Ragan-Kelley calls “user-schedulable languages” (USLs). Instead of hoping that an opaque compiler will auto-generate the fastest possible code, USLs put programmers in the driver's seat, allowing them to write “schedules” that explicitly control how the compiler generates code. This enables performance engineers to transform simple programs that specify what they want to compute into complex programs that do the same thing as the original specification, but much, much faster.One of the limitations of existing USLs (like the original Exo) is their relatively fixed set of scheduling operations, which makes it difficult to reuse scheduling code across different “kernels” (the individual components in a high-performance library).In contrast, Exo 2 enables users to define new scheduling operations externally to the compiler, facilitating the creation of reusable scheduling libraries. Lead author Yuka Ikarashi, an MIT PhD student in electrical engineering and computer science and CSAIL affiliate, says that Exo 2 can reduce total schedule code by a factor of 100 and deliver performance competitive with state-of-the-art implementations on multiple different platforms, including Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) that power many machine learning applications. This makes it an attractive option for engineers in HPC focused on optimizing kernels across different operations, data types, and target architectures.“It’s a bottom-up approach to automation, rather than doing an ML/AI search over high-performance code,” says Ikarashi. “What that means is that performance engineers and hardware implementers can write their own scheduling library, which is a set of optimization techniques to apply on their hardware to reach the peak performance.”One major advantage of Exo 2 is that it reduces the amount of coding effort needed at any one time by reusing the scheduling code across applications and hardware targets. The researchers implemented a scheduling library with roughly 2,000 lines of code in Exo 2, encapsulating reusable optimizations that are linear-algebra specific and target-specific (AVX512, AVX2, Neon, and Gemmini hardware accelerators). This library consolidates scheduling efforts across more than 80 high-performance kernels with up to a dozen lines of code each, delivering performance comparable to, or better than, MKL, OpenBLAS, BLIS, and Halide.Exo 2 includes a novel mechanism called “Cursors” that provides what they call a “stable reference” for pointing at the object code throughout the scheduling process. Ikarashi says that a stable reference is essential for users to encapsulate schedules within a library function, as it renders the scheduling code independent of object-code transformations.“We believe that USLs should be designed to be user-extensible, rather than having a fixed set of operations,” says Ikarashi. “In this way, a language can grow to support large projects through the implementation of libraries that accommodate diverse optimization requirements and application domains.”Exo 2’s design allows performance engineers to focus on high-level optimization strategies while ensuring that the underlying object code remains functionally equivalent through the use of safe primitives. In the future, the team hopes to expand Exo 2’s support for different types of hardware accelerators, like GPUs. Several ongoing projects aim to improve the compiler analysis itself, in terms of correctness, compilation time, and expressivity.Ikarashi and Ragan-Kelley co-authored the paper with graduate students Kevin Qian and Samir Droubi, Alex Reinking of Adobe, and former CSAIL postdoc Gilbert Bernstein, now a professor at the University of Washington. This research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. National Science Foundation, while the first author was also supported by Masason, Funai, and Quad Fellowships.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A look at Firefox forks</title><link>https://lwn.net/Articles/1012453/</link><author>sohkamyung</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:25:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

           By March 4, 2025Mozilla's actions have been rubbing many Firefox fans the
wrong way as of late, and inspiring them to look for alternatives.
There are many choices for users who are looking for a browser that
isn't part of the Chrome monoculture but is full-featured and suitable
for day-to-day use. For those who are willing to stay in the Firefox
"family" there are a number of good options that have taken vastly
different approaches. This includes GNU IceCat, Floorp, LibreWolf, and Zen.Mozilla has been disappointing a lot of Firefox users for years,
but it seems the pace is accelerating. Its announcement on
February 19 that it needs to "diversify" beyond Firefox did not
inspire confidence, and it annoyed many who would like to see Mozilla
go all-in on its flagship browser (and increase its market share)
rather than chasing AI or dabbling in advertising. But a recent and
more alarming example is its introduction of terms of use for the
browser and the removal of its pledge not to sell users' personal
data. Though it has backpedaled
somewhat since, and rewritten its terms of use, the damage has been
done.
Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it
flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come.
The GNU project also adopted the name IceWeasel for the GNUzilla
project—basically Mozilla source code with any non-free
code, such as the Adobe Flash
Player, stripped out. In 2007, Karl Berry announced
that GNUzilla would be adopting the name IceCat for its version
"not because we have anything against weasels" but to avoid
confusion with Debian's version.IceCat has the distinction of being the oldest Firefox fork still
in development. Ray Dryden applied
for GNUzilla to become part of the GNU Project in August 2005,
and test releases based on Firefox 1.5.0 were available later
that year. IceCat, as with all of the forks covered in this article,
is available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0. However, the
scripts and other tools used to create an IceCat release from Firefox
are licensed under the GPLv3.GNUzilla does not distribute binaries of IceCat. The project
recommends using GNU Guix to
install IceCat on x86_64 Linux systems, and also makes its scripts
available in its Git repository to
compile IceCat from Firefox's extended-support releases (ESRs). It
may, however, also be packaged for a user's favorite Linux
distribution. Fedora 41, for example, currently has
IceCat 115.20.0esr—which is based on Firefox 115.20.0;
both were released on February 4.Current-day IceCat has several changes that distinguish it from
Firefox. The most immediately obvious is its use of the LibreJS add-on to
block "nonfree nontrivial JavaScript while allowing JavaScript that
is free and/or trivial". In practice, this means that a significant 
number of sites will not work unless the user adds exceptions for
the JavaScript used by the site. Users can choose to add exceptions for
individual scripts blocked by LibreJS or to add an exception for the
entire site. Even LWN, which uses a minimal amount of JavaScript,
has scripts that are blocked by LibreJS.IceCat includes the JShelter
extension, which attempts to block not just malware, but browser fingerprinting
and user tracking as well. It modifies the JavaScript environment that
is available to web pages to try to confuse fingerprinters and make it
more difficult to carry out attacks using JavaScript. It may block
APIs or return fake values to thwart these attempts. Like LibreJS, it
can be modified or turned off
entirely for specific sites. There is a paper from 2022 that
explains the extension's approach in great detail, and an extensive FAQ that may be of use
in troubleshooting interactions between JShelter and web sites.In a similar vein, IceCat includes a fork of
the Third-party
Request Blocker extension that (as the name implies) blocks
connections to third-party resources without user consent. It is a
little concerning that the page
describing the extension describes it as "seemingly maintained by
'sw'", and its last update was in March 2020. The home page
listed for the extension is no longer available. Despite the lag in
development, it still seems to be working and blocking plenty of
third-party requests. A visit to a site like The Guardian, for instance, shows
seven sites blocked. As the screenshot shows, site layout and images
are often affected by IceCat's default settings. Usually the sites are
still usable, but far less aesthetically pleasing.One thing that worked well for me was to enable just enough
to see the page text and then use the reader view to read a site's
articles or other content. (Sadly, none of the forks offer a "browse
everything in reader view by default" option.)In all, IceCat ships with eight extensions that either attempt to
enhance user privacy, block non-free software, or unbreak sites that
are affected by its other extensions. It includes a "LibreJS/USPS
compatibility" plugin to offer an alternative shipping calculator for
the US Postal Service site as well as
an extension to replace JavaScript blocked by LibreJS on the Library
Genesis sites.The project has an extension-finder service called Mozzarella, which (of course)
only lists extensions that are free software. However, the extensions
may be outdated compared to their counterparts listed in Firefox's
add-on catalog. For example, the Privacy Badger extension in the Mozzarella
catalog was last updated in June 2023. The Firefox
catalog version was last updated on January 29, 2025.Right now, three people are listed as maintainers for GNUzilla:
Ruben Rodriguez, Amin Bandali, and Mark H. Weaver. The development
mailing lists are a bit on the quiet side. The last-archived
conversation currently for the gnuzilla-dev list is from
August 2024. The bug-gnuzilla
list is a little more lively—its last activity was in
December 2024.IceCat is probably a good choice for folks who are more concerned
with the free software ethos and privacy than with
functionality.The Floorp project is a much
newer entrant. It is developed by a community
of Japanese students called Ablaze. Development is hosted on GitHub,
and the project solicits donations
via GitHub donations. According to its donations page, donors who
contribute at the $100 level may submit ads to feature in the new tab
page—but the ads, which are displayed as shortcuts with a
"sponsored" label, can be turned off in the settings. I've been unable
to find any information about the project governance or legal
structure of Ablaze.Its contributors
page lists seven primary maintainers and 39 code contributors, as well as
many people who have contributed to its language packs and
translations, or who maintain packages. Floorp does not offer native
packages for Linux distributions, but it does provide a Flatpak via
Flathub and precompiled
releases for x86_64 and ARM64.Originally Floorp was based on Chromium but switched to Firefox in
early 2022. The first Firefox-derived version was Floorp v7 (announcement in
Japanese), and it was based on the Firefox rapid releases, but the
project switched to the ESR releases as their base with v8. The most
recent release, version 11.23.1, was announced on
February 15, and is based on (according to
) the Firefox ESR 128.8.0 release,
which came out on March 4. It would
be nice if the project were more explicit in its release notes about which
version of Firefox a release was based on. This is not merely for
curiosity's sake—it would help users track whether Floorp was
receiving the most recent security updates. The project has said that
it plans to
move back to the rapid release versions of Firefox with v12, which is
currently in beta.The project promises "strong tracking protection" and that
it does not track users or have any affiliation with advertising
companies. However, the project does not give details on how its
tracking protection differs from Firefox's. It still uses Google as
its default search engine and includes the Firefox
browser sync feature. It also uses Mozilla's add-ons repository,
and should work with most Firefox add-ons
that are compatible with the corresponding Firefox version.Floorp does have a number of interesting features and enhancements
that may tempt users. It has a dual-sidebar layout that allows users
to access bookmarks, history, and other tools on the left-hand side,
while the right-hand has the Web Apps panel. Users can add web sites
to open in the Web Apps panel, which can be useful while (for example)
doing research for an article while keeping a version of the article
open in the panel.In addition to the Apps panel, Floorp has a split-view feature that
lets users open two pages side-by-side by selecting a tab and clicking
"Split this Tab". Each split has its own history and URL bar. Floorp's
layout is great for wide-screen monitors, and I like the ability to
open sites in split view rather than juggling multiple browser
windows.Another interesting inclusion in Floorp is its Workspace
feature. This allows users to group tabs by categories like
"work", "comics", "shopping", or whatever makes sense for the users'
browsing habits. I've found this useful for working on projects and
stories for LWN—I might have a dozen tabs open for a specific
story, which I can group into a single workspace. Workspaces can also
be assigned to Firefox's multi-account
containers. For example, a user might want to log in to the same
site using different accounts—without having to sign in and out
repeatedly. Combining the workspace and multi-account containers can
be useful in a number of scenarios.Firefox's tabs have seen little feature advancement in the past few
years. Floorp adds a few much-needed enhancements here, allowing users
to move the tab bar to the bottom of the window, use a multi-row tab
bar, and even a vertical tab bar. However, the Floorp implementation
of the vertical tab bar will go away in v12, now that Mozilla has
finally
added vertical tabs in Firefox 136.0.Overall, Floorp is an interesting project with some nice
enhancements to the Firefox UI. However, the development roadmap seems
a bit more haphazard than I would like—switching back and forth
between Firefox rapid release and ESRs, for example. That may not
dissuade other folks, though.The LibreWolf project got its start in 2020. Its focus is primarily
around privacy, security, and the removal of ""
features, such as telemetry and DRM, from Firefox. It lists seven core
contributors on its home page and points to its Matrix room for
development discussions. Its development is hosted on Codeberg.LibreWolf has the normal configuration options one would expect for
a Firefox fork, but it also has the option of using a special
configuration file called  to set
preferences that can take effect across multiple profiles rather than
having to tweak the configuration for each profile. It also makes
preferences easy to back up and move to a new machine. The documentation explains
where to find this file, depending on the installation method, and offers
several suggestions for possible preference changes.LibreWolf is mostly notable for what it  have
rather than what it does. That is, it removes other features from
Firefox that have not been well-received by many users such as Pocket
integration, telemetry, and more. Firefox Sync is disabled by default
but it can be enabled in settings.LibreWolf does include the uBlock Origin add-blocker add-on
as part of its standard installation. It should be noted that uBlock
Origin is being disabled
for Chrome users as Google phases
out support for the WebExtension
API V2 in favor of V3, which will curtail features that uBlock
Origin and other add-ons require to function. To its credit, Mozilla
has committed
to continuing its support for Manifest V2 and V3. LWN covered Manifest V3 and
its impact on content blockers in 2021.For the most part, users would be hard-pressed to spot many
differences between LibreWolf and Firefox at first (or second) glance,
so a screen shot of LibreWolf seemed a bit unnecessary. That approach
is likely to appeal to many users who are uneasy with things like
telemetry and Pocket, but don't want an entirely new browsing
experience.The Zen browser project is the most recent entrant. Its development
began last year with an
announcement on Reddit. It is currently in beta, with its most
recent version, 1.8.2b
based on Firefox 135.0.1, released on
February 25. Kudos to the Zen project, by the way, for
proudly including the Firefox version alongside the project version in
its "About" dialog—information that literally every other
Firefox fork seems intent on hiding. Zen lists 12 people in the main
project team, and about 90 contributors to the
browser. Development for Zen is hosted on GitHub,
and discussion takes place on Discord (link goes
to a Discord invitation).Like Floorp, the project solicits donations to
assist with development, but little information seems to be available
about its governance or structure to provide transparency about how
the money is spent.Unlike the other forks, it is not immediately obvious that Zen is
an offshoot of Firefox. It does not look at all like the standard
Firefox interface, even before users start customizing it. Even
Floorp, which allows significant customization, still bears some
resemblance to Firefox on first use. Zen sports a tab sidebar on the
left that blends the Workspace concept from Floorp and vertical tabs,
with a set of default bookmarks ("Essentials") as icons at the
top. The browser menu is located in the top-left corner, indicated by
a button with three dots. The window title bar is hidden and only
appears if a user hovers the mouse at the top of the window for a few
seconds.While Zen looks modern and interesting, its sleek user interface
and configurability comes at the cost of intuitive usability in some
cases. For example, one might expect that setting Zen to light mode in
the "Language and Appearance" settings would also change the browser's
interface to light mode. It does not, as shown in the
screenshot. Instead, a user has to go to the "Add-ons and Themes"
settings to select a light theme. It would help a great deal if Zen's
user guide
were more complete, but it only has a little bit of documentation to
offer at the moment. To be fair, it is still a beta project, so it may
be much improved by the time the Zen browser has its first stable
release. For now, users will need to be ready to dig through Reddit
and other forums for tips.Features like glance, which pre-fetches a link and gives a preview
of it before opening it in a new tab or window, are useful, but not at
all obvious how to use, even if one is aware the feature exists. (On
Linux, activate glance with .) Likewise, Zen's
split-screen mode requires the user to select multiple tabs and then
right-click to select "Split Tab". Rearranging the splits is also not
intuitive. That said, the additional features are compelling if one is
willing to do some searching to figure things out.The Zen interface can be customized extensively to suit individual
tastes via the settings. If those options aren't enough, Zen has its
own set of add-ons and extensions called Mods to modify the interface
or add features. This ranges from a green-hued theme called Matcha to tweaks
to further minimize the sidebar. Most Firefox add-ons should work
with Zen as well, though some may clash with its user-interface
changes.Currently, Zen isn't fully baked enough for me to consider
switching to it. Others may be more adventurous in their
browsing habits than I am, though. I can say that it has stabilized
significantly since I first tried it shortly after its first public
release. The project does bear keeping an eye on, and the Mozilla
folks could do worse than to copy some of the ideas (and code) that
the project is experimenting with.The Firefox fork rabbit hole is surprisingly deep. There are a few
alternatives I chose not to try—but mention here for
completeness—and probably a few that I've missed. The Basilisk project
is a kind of retro-Firefox project that aims to retain technologies that
Firefox has removed. This includes the deprecated Netscape Plugin Application
Programming Interface (NPAPI) plugin support, ALSA support on
Linux, XUL extensions,
and more.The Pale Moon project is
another browser that has forked off of Mozilla Firefox code and no
longer tracks it directly. It uses
the Goanna
fork of the Gecko rendering engine and still supports NPAPI
plugins and XUL extensions. The project promises no telemetry or data
gathering. It offers a somewhat nostalgic look and feel
that is similar to Firefox in the mid-2000s.For those who pine for the days of the Netscape suite that included
the browser, mail client, HTML editor, IRC chat, and more, there is SeaMonkey. The project
uses code from Firefox and Thunderbird, though it is not directly
based on recent versions. According to its site, it backports security
fixes from Firefox and Thunderbird ESRs that apply to SeaMonkey. The
project also maintains the Composer HTML editor and ChatZilla IRC
client that are no longer maintained by Mozilla. SeaMonkey is still
packaged for a number of Linux distributions, and binaries are
available for Linux on x86_64 and x86 as a tarball. It might be a good
option for users who are still using 32-bit x86 Linux systems.Still dependent on MozillaRegardless which Firefox fork one chooses, it is important to
remember the downsides. First and foremost, all of the forks are
dependent on Mozilla to do the heavy lifting. The bulk of development
is carried by Mozilla, the direction of Firefox is set by Mozilla, and
choosing to run a fork puts the user one step removed from security
and bug fixes. This does not mean users shouldn't consider one
of these forks, but they should be aware of the potential
downsides.There is some precedent for soft forks displacing the original
upstream. For example, the Go-oo fork of
OpenOffice.org became LibreOffice after Oracle consumed Sun. That fork
has clearly overtaken OpenOffice.org in the Linux community as the
go-to desktop office suite and its development has eclipsed that of
its counterpart Apache OpenOffice. Go-oo, of course, had corporate
support as well as community support. For a Firefox fork to be truly
independent and sustainable, it would need a similar effort behind
it. Thus far, no such movement has materialized.A recent question on the LibreWolf issue tracker drives that point
home nicely. User "kallisti5" asked if
LibreWolf was prepared to fork Firefox "if Mozilla continues
farther down this path?" One of LibreWolf's contributors, "ohfp",
replied that the project was "absolutely not prepared to do
that" due to limited time and energy to work on the project as it
is. "We would not even remotely be able to fork and maintain a
browser fully, let alone to continually develop and improve
it."Another downside to the forks is that there are far fewer eyes on
their code and communities. When Mozilla makes an important move,
whether it's positive or negative, users are likely to hear about it
quickly. As of now, the forks get relatively little attention.Folks who want to jump ship from Mozilla's ecosystem entirely,
while still sticking to open source, have some options. Ladybird,
which LWN covered in
June last year, is an attempt to create a new browser from whole
cloth. It is an interesting effort, but not ready for day-to-day use
for most folks. Qutebrowser, Nyxt, and NetSurf are also worth a
look—though they may have some drawbacks for day-to-day use in
terms of site compatibility and features. We will take a look at some
of those options soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Live Ransomware Demo: See How Hackers Breach Networks and Demand a Ransom</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/live-ransomware-demo-see-how-hackers.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh259dK-WFCoXwQ5c8qDtAn1mICm9pXOy3tt6q_BpnVivinJx-IAzdqp8Jd4U8c2iSd6syEEAGWiOdD6mjEWJLV2c1npVfCariIxayajn414lBPp1aVpggtjwLpR_iE3Ntoq5lseG_gUmh5JDssQFJCS_2bHGsOO0mW9DXss5nXnC0WLyE19_u_u-S0iFI/s1600/ransomware-malware.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber threats evolve daily.

About Best Fancy Text Fonts
 have been in trend for a long time. Their most noticeable use is on social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Some of these fancy styles not only have aesthetics but are also attention-grabbing, which is why you might have encountered them while scrolling through your feeds. Below we have featured some of the coolest fonts that you can use to make your next text stylish.

Cursive also known as script font with its handwriting-like style makes it one of the most eye-pleasing text styles. Its flowing design can add a touch of elegance to your writing, making it perfect for highlighting specific parts of your text. For example, you can conclude a message with "𝒯𝒽𝒶𝓃𝓀 𝓎ℴ𝓊". Additionally, it works well for brief, heartfelt messages; for instance, sending a "𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓜𝓸𝓻𝓷𝓲𝓷𝓰 😊" to your mother would be a wonderful way to start her day.

Gothic font, also known as Fraktur or Blackletter, has the classic vibe of Old English text. With its sharp and angular design, it provides an aesthetic historical feel. Fraktur font has a bold and sophisticated appearance, making it an excellent choice for titles, headings, or for emphasizing parts of the text. For instance, you might wish your friend a great start to the season by writing, "𝕲𝖗𝖊𝖆𝖙 𝕭𝖊𝖌𝖌𝖎𝖓𝖎𝖓𝖌".

One of the most  created using Unicode symbols is the Bold font. We often feel the urge to make certain parts of our text bold to highlight their importance, but many online communities do not have this option. With the text generator, it’s now super easy to emphasize your text and copy-paste it in bold format. Simply enter the text you want to highlight and choose from many available options, including 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝘀-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗳 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱, 𝑩𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝑰𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒄, 𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝, and some cooler styles like 𝓢𝓬𝓻𝓲𝓹𝓽 and 𝕱𝖗𝖆𝖐𝖙𝖚𝖗.

Monospace is a beautiful-looking font style with its characters taking up the same amount of horizontal space. Unlike other fonts with characters having varying widths, monospace characters maintain the same width. This type of text style can create a clean, minimalist appearance and adds a nostalgic typewriter feel. Monospace text can be useful when sharing lists, instructions, or information such as a URL, for example 𝚑𝚝𝚝𝚙𝚜://𝚎𝚡𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎.𝚌𝚘𝚖.𝚌𝚘𝚖/. It can enhance the clarity of your text.

Circled or bubble text is a cool-looking font style with each character enclosed in a circle. This font style gives a fun feel which makes it a good choice for informal and creative uses. It has two variants 🅓🅐🅡🅚 and normal Ⓑⓤⓑⓑⓛⓔ text style. It can add a cheerful touch to your social media posts, comments, or messages. For example, you could use it to announce something exciting on your Instagram page with a caption Ⓝⓔⓦ ⒶⓡⓡⓘⓥⒶⓛ or 🅒🅞🅝🅖🅡🅐🅣🅤🅛🅐🅣🅔 a close friend to make their day.

Square text is a modern-looking font style with each character being enclosed in a block. Its modern and striking look is a great way to capture attention on social media. You can create unique headlines and emphasize key points with this style. For example, you can use it to announce updates like 🆆🅸🅽🆃🅴🆁 🆂🅰🅻🅴 on your page or send fun messages to friends, such as 🅶🅾🅾🅳 🅽🅸🅶🅷🆃. Its clean and aesthetically pleasing look is a perfect way to add a trendy look to your text.

I’m sharing how I did it, along with the full source code.To clarify, multiple ransomware variants have been named Akira over the years, and several versions are currently circulating. The variant I encountered has been active from late 2023 to the present (the company was breached this year).There was an earlier version (before mid-2023) that contained a bug, allowing Avast to create a decryptor. However, once this was published, the attackers updated their encryption. I expect they will change their encryption again after I publish this.You can find various Akira malware sample hashes at the following URL:The sample that matches my client’s case is:bcae978c17bcddc0bf6419ae978e3471197801c36f73cff2fc88cecbe3d88d1aIt is listed under the version: . The sample can be found on virus.exchange (just paste the hash to search).Note that the ransom message and the private/public keys will differ.We do this not because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easyI usually decline requests to assist with ransomware cases. However, when my friend showed me this particular case, a quick check made me think it was solvable.From my initial analysis, I observed the following:The ransomware uses the current time (in nanoseconds) as a seed.On my Linux machine, file modification times have nanosecond resolution.They provided a screenshot of a partial log (), showing when the ransomware was executed, with millisecond resolution.Based on this, my initial thought was: “This should be easy—just brute-force it by looking at the file timestamps. How hard can it be?”I’ll explain in more detail, but it turned out to be more complicated than expected:The malware doesn’t rely on a single moment in time but uses , each with . The fist two and last two are related, so we can’t just bruteforce the time one by one. Key generation is complex, involving  for each timestamp. Each file ends up with a unique key.The  only records file modification times with .Not all  have millisecond resolution in their log files, some only log with second-level precision. I am still unsure what configuration file causes this different behaviorThe malware uses  during execution.The file modification time reflects , not when it is opened for writing.The code is written in , which is notoriously difficult to read, but fortunately, it wasn’t obfuscated. The binary is statically linked (a bit harder to analyze), but all strings are in cleartext. The error messages indicate that the  library is used, which made understanding the code much easier.The code to generate random is like this (the actual code is in 0x455f40 in the binary)void generate_random(char *buffer, int size)
{
    uint64_t t = get_current_time_nanosecond();
    char seed[32];
 //in the real code, it uses C++ code to convert int to string
    snprintf(seed, sizeof(seed), "%lld", t);
    struct yarrow256_ctx ctx;
    yarrow256_init(&ctx, 0, NULL);
    yarrow256_seed(&ctx, strlen(seed), seed);
    yarrow256_random(&ctx, size, buffer);   
}

The random generator is implemented in . Here is the relevant code, with unnecessary parts removed. As noted in the comments:The number of iterations when reseeding, P_t in the yarrow paper. Should be chosen so that reseeding takes on the order of 0.1-1 seconds.void
yarrow256_seed(struct yarrow256_ctx *ctx,
	       size_t length,
	       const uint8_t *seed_file)
{
  sha256_update(&ctx->pools[YARROW_FAST], length, seed_file);
  yarrow256_fast_reseed(ctx);
}

yarrow256_fast_reseed(struct yarrow256_ctx *ctx)
{
  uint8_t digest[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];
  unsigned i;   
  sha256_digest(&ctx->pools[YARROW_FAST], sizeof(digest), digest);
  /* Iterate */
  yarrow_iterate(digest);
  aes256_set_encrypt_key(&ctx->key, digest);
  /* Derive new counter value */
  memset(ctx->counter, 0, sizeof(ctx->counter));
  aes256_encrypt(&ctx->key, sizeof(ctx->counter), ctx->counter, ctx->counter); 
}

/* The number of iterations when reseeding, P_t in the yarrow paper.

#define YARROW_RESEED_ITERATIONS 1500


static void
yarrow_iterate(uint8_t *digest)
{
  uint8_t v0[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];
  unsigned i;
  
  memcpy(v0, digest, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE);
  
  /* When hashed inside the loop, i should run from 1 to
   * YARROW_RESEED_ITERATIONS */
  for (i = 0; ++i < YARROW_RESEED_ITERATIONS; )
    {
      uint8_t count[4];
      struct sha256_ctx hash;
  
      sha256_init(&hash);

      /* Hash v_i | v_0 | i */
      WRITE_UINT32(count, i);
      sha256_update(&hash, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);
      sha256_update(&hash, sizeof(v0), v0);
      sha256_update(&hash, sizeof(count), count);

      sha256_digest(&hash, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);
    }
}
The ransomware calls the random generator four times:generate_random(chacha8_key 32);
generate_random(chacha8_nonce, 16);
generate_random(kcipher2_key, 16);
generate_random(kcipher2_key, 16);
Each  call uses the current nanosecond timestamp as a seed. Therefore, there are  that need to be identified. The ransomware generates different keys for each file.These keys are then saved at the end of the file as a trailer, encrypted with  and padded using .The files are divided into , and a percentage of each block is encrypted. This percentage is defined by the ransomware’s  parameter. For each block:The first  are encrypted using .The remaining bytes are encrypted using ..The following picture shows how a file is split. Note that, for very small files, knowing the Chacha8 key and IV isn’t necessary..After studying various VMware filetypes (I will go deeper into this later), I am convinced that the most important files (flat VMDK and sesparse files) has a fixed header, and I can use that to attack the  encryption.At this point, I didn’t analyze deeper. But I am sure that I can reverse engineer the rest of the algorithms later, specifically:How to split the file into blocksHow is the encryption performed across blocks, does it continue the stream?These details will be important later. However, for now, if we can’t successfully brute-force the timestamps, none of the other steps will matter.The approach is as follows: ( and ).Convert these timestamps into seeds and generate random bytes.Use these bytes as the .Encrypt known plaintext and compare the result with the known ciphertext from the encrypted file.: Determine if brute-forcing is fast enough to be practical.: Known plaintext is required for brute-forcing. Estimate the seed initialization time: We need to know when the encryption seed was initialized, at least with . This knowledge can reduce the brute-force scope to about .The simplest (but inefficient) way is to try all possible timestamp pairs where . The number of possible pairs is calculated as: N×(N−1)/2With , that results in  possible pairs.We need to optimize this. First we need to convert all the nanoseconds in a one-to random values:On my , I estimated a processing speed of 100,000 timestamp to random bytes calculations per second (utilizing all cores).This means it would take about  (under ) to convert all timestamps to seed values.Once converted, these values can be saved for reuse.Later, I optimized the process using a , reducing the conversion time from 3 hours to under 6 minutes.If we have a completely deterministic machine, without any interruption, we can run the malware, measure it, know the exact time between T3 and T4. But unfortunately we don’t have this:The malware uses multiple threads,It runs on a machine that is not idle, the distance between T3 and T4 varies based on the scheduler and how busy the system at that time. The code also calls a lot of C++ libraries, which allocates and deallocates objects and makes the execution time more unpredictable.we need to enumerate t3 (1 billion values for each second)we dont start at t3 + 1, but at t3 + start offset, since we know that seeding the value takes time (at least a million nanosecond on my machine), this is the ““we assume that it will only take a few million nanosecond to until the next code is executed (remember: there can be interruptions because of the CPU scheduler, and there are several millions instructions executed). This is the “” valueWhat we can do is to try to run the exact same code as the malware, collect timing data, and try to find a range that statistically makes sense. Using the same technique that I use on my previous post, instead of recreating the algorithm and running it, I just modified the malware and tested on several local machines that I have. The runtime varies quite a lot between machines.My friend Deny went to the datacenter and did the test on the real hardware that was infected. The result is: the time range varies, and sometimes quite a lot. The normal range of the offset is around 2-4 million nanoseconds (so the offset range is 2 million), but the value varies from 1.5 – 5 million (total offset range is  4.5 million). We still need to enumerate 4.5 quadrillion pairs, but this appears to be doable. If we have a system capable of running 50 million encryptions per second, the process would take a few hundred days. However, with 16 such systems, we could complete it in a few months on a CPU. By renting additional machines, we could speed up the process even further. Later, I optimized this using a GPU, achieving a significant speed improvement.I wasn’t sure about how fast we can do Kicpher2, but a quick comparison with chacha, and some quick benchmarking shows that using CPU ony, I should be able to do at least millions of Kichper operations per second on my machine.As explained before,  if  and  are correct, we will be able to decrypt the  of the file, and it will decrypt to a known plaintext.Next lets check the feasibility of obtaining plaintext from different VMware filesFor each file, we need a plaintext sample: the first 8 bytes of the file for KCipher2 (offset 0) and another 8 bytes starting from offset 65,535 (only for large files). Since each block of KCipher2 is 8 bytes, we should use an 8-byte plaintext. It is possible to use fewer bytes (by using bit masking), but this could increase the risk of false positives.This is a raw disk file. If you’re lucky, this might be the only file you need to recover. However, if snapshots were made (as in this client’s case), the new data would be written to sesparse files.To obtain the first 8 bytes of the flat VMDK, you’ll need to install the same OS that was used on the original VM. There are several variations of bootloaders used by different OS versions.To determine which OS was used, check the corresponding VMX file. It should contain partially readable plaintext, allowing you to inspect the configuration for “guestOS”. You might find something like: guestOS=”ubuntu”. However, ideally, you already have documentation regarding which OS was used for each VM, so you don’t have to rely on this method.For the bytes at position 65,535 (plaintext for Chacha8), it is almost always guaranteed to be zero, since the partition typically starts at a later sector.If you create snapshots for your VM, there will be a SESPARSE file for each snapshots. We can see the file format from the QEMU source code.The file header is , and at position 65,535, it should be 0x0 (at least, that’s what I observed in my analysis).Other files are not critical for restoring a working VM, but for initial testing, understanding the time distribution can be helpful. If there are many small files with the same timestamp, it’s useful to know if they cluster within a specific timestamp range.Here are some common file signatures to identify plaintexts:NVRAM files start with: 4d 52 56 4e 01 00 00 00VMDK files (disk descriptor) start with the string: .VMX files start with: VMware log files have lines starting with the format: Since these files are partially readable, we can often guess the initial timestamp based on the beginning of the file (e.g., the  part of the log).By identifying plaintexts in these files, the next step is to narrow down the timestamp for accurate brute-forcing.Now that we know brute-forcing is feasible and we have both plaintext and ciphertext, the next step is to determine when the encryption occurred for each file (since each file will have different keys).The command used to run the malware is recorded in the shell.log file (including the setting for n, which defines how much of the file should be encrypted).Some ESXi hosts provide millisecond resolution in their logs, while others only offer second-level precision. This log gives us the initial timestamp for when the malware started.For example, if the log shows that the malware started at 10:00:01.500, we can safely ignore the first 500 million nanoseconds when brute-forcing, which helps narrow down the search range.Filesystem timestamp and modification timeUnfortunately, ESXi file systems do not support nanosecond precision.Another challenge is that the file modification time is recorded only when the file is closed. This means the recorded timestamp might not exactly reflect the moment when the encryption process started but rather when it ended.For small files, encryption typically takes only a few milliseconds, so the timestamp will most likely reflect the exact second when the file was encrypted. The next step is to determine the encryption time for larger files, where the process takes longer and the timestamps may be less precise.Multithreaded  EncryptionThe malware uses multithreading, where each file is processed in a new thread, with a pool of workers limited by the number of CPU cores. This has both advantages and disadvantages.If the malware targets a single directory and the number of files is less than the number of CPU cores, the process is straightforward—each file will have a timestamp that is very close to the others. On an ESXi machine, it’s common to have CPUs with a large number of cores (in this case, the server has 64 cores).When checking for timestamps using:find /vmfs/volumes -exec stat {} \;
we should be able to identify small files that were encrypted first. During brute-forcing, we can then check multiple files simultaneously for that specific moment in time.Files processed first will have similar timestamps, but things become more complex for files processed later. For larger files, encryption can take seconds to minutes, and the modification time will reflect when the file was closed, which is significantly later than when the encryption key was actually generated.The malware uses  for traversing directories and files. The iterator in  follows the order returned by , which is the same order observed when using commands like  or .Let’s consider an example where we have 4 CPU cores and 8 files. If the files are tiny (less than 1 KB, such as VMDK descriptor files), their processing is almost instantaneous (within milliseconds). Here’s how the processing might look: each find and process  (, , ), while  finds a  (). All four files are processed . Once  complete, they begin processing the  (, , ). However, these files are  and require . While the other three threads are still working,   finishes processing the large  and starts working on the  (). As a result, the  of  will align with the  of .Now, imagine having hundreds of files—it becomes difficult to determine the exact processing order. However, one consistent observation is that the encryption start time for a file is likely to be the same or very close to the modification time of another file.This is because, once a thread finishes processing and closes a file (thereby recording its modification time), it will immediately start processing the next available file. This creates a sequence where the encryption start time of one file is closely linked to the modification time of the previous file.So given few hundred files and plenty of CPU cores, we may only have a list of a few seconds where the malware will start to generate the random keys. So now we have the final part of the puzzle: we know  the encryption was performed.While reviewing the client’s logs, I noticed some entries mentioning the use of NFS. However, after clarification, it was confirmed that NFS was used only for backups and was not affected. All relevant files were stored on local disks on the server.If a network filesystem had been used, it would have complicated the process. If the network time between systems wasn’t perfectly synchronized, the timestamps might have been inaccurate or unreliable, further complicating the brute-force process.The plan seemed solid, so the next step was to implement the code. I needed to confirm whether the encryption process worked exactly like the malware.To test this, I patched the malware code to make the gettime function return a constant value of 0, ensuring predictable and consistent results during testing.I focused on KCipher2 because not all files use the Chacha8 key, particularly small files. Although KCipher2 is a standard encryption algorithm, it’s not widely known, and I couldn’t find an optimized implementation for it.During experimentation, I noticed that my results didn’t match the standard KCipher2 implementations available online. It turned out that the malware included a slight modification in the initialization vector and the encryption process, specifically involving endian swapping.I’m not an expert in CUDA programming. About 10 years ago, I briefly experimented with it but couldn’t find a practical use case for the company I worked for at the time.To accelerate development, I asked ChatGPT (o1) to port the code to CUDA. The code compiled successfully but produced incorrect results. It turned out that ChatGPT had slightly modified the numbers in the constant tables. After manually correcting these values, the code began to work.Although the implementation ran, I suspected it was suboptimal, but I wasn’t able to get further optimization suggestions from ChatGPT (o1). At that point, I had two options: spend more time optimizing the code or proceed with the predicted offset range and refine the code along the way. I chose to start testing immediately and optimize as needed. Unfortunately, this approach turned out to be a waste of money, as it didn’t yield any successful results.At the start of the project, I only had two RTX 3060 GPUs. One was dedicated to my Windows machine, so I could only use one GPU on my Mini PC (connected externally via Oculink). To improve performance, I decided to purchase an RTX 3090. The price in Thailand was still reasonable compared to the 4090 or higher models.I tested the implementation by reading the key and IV from memory, encrypting zero blocks, and writing the results back to memory. The performance was disappointing, achieving only around 60 million encryptions per second. At this rate, the entire process would take about 10 years, clearly too slow for practical recovery.I performed some manual optimizations by removing unnecessary code to improve performance:Only the first block is needed for brute force, so there was no need to handle additional blocks.The code was simplified to only encrypt blocks of zeroes, reducing unnecessary processing.Since only the first 8 bytes of the result were required, the rest of the output was ignored to minimize computation.After researching CUDA optimizations for AES, I discovered that using shared memory significantly improves performance, contrary to what ChatGPT suggested. Surprisingly, the extra steps involved in copying constant memory data to shared memory were negligible in terms of overhead but resulted in the code running several times faster.Initially, I performed encryption on the GPU and matching on the host (CPU). However, this approach was slow, even when executed in parallel:generate encryption on GPUPerform matching in a new thread and submit the next batch of work to the GPU.I found it much faster to avoid writing to memory altogether. Instead, the matching process is handled directly on the GPU, and no data is written to memory unless a match is found. This approach significantly reduced processing time and improved efficiency.For each t3 and t4 combination, a match can occur for any file that shares the same second-level timestamp (but with different nanoseconds).To improve efficiency, we can attempt to match multiple files simultaneously. However, if there are too many files to match, the process can slow down significantly. Currently, the number of files processed in parallel is hardcoded to 32 to maintain a balance between performance and efficiency.I considered and implemented two ways to do the loop. For every t3 value, we could start a GPU kernel to check all offset ranges. However, this method is inefficient, as it would require launching the kernel a billion times, resulting in significant overhead..Alternatively, we can launch a GPU kernel for each offset. Each kernel would then perform the necessary checks. This approach is much faster because it reduces the number of submissions to just the “offset range”, which is around 2 to 4.5 million jobs.Initially, my approach was to submit a task to the GPU, wait for the result using , and then submit the next batch of work. However, this method proved to be slow.Submit work to the GPU, and if a match is found, simply mark it using a found flag.Only call  to check results every 100 steps. If a match is found, the flag is reset to zero before proceeding.While this method significantly improved performance, there’s a slight possibility that if two offsets are very close (less than 100 steps apart), the code might miss one of them. Although this issue never occurred during my tests, I added an optional mode of loop. In this mode, the program reads a list of  offsets and ensures that nearby offsets are also checked manually to avoid missing any potential matches.I believe that GPU experts could still find ways to further optimize my code. Currently, I’m achieving around 1.5 billion encryptions per second for KCipher2 on my RTX 3090.For testing 1 billion values with a single offset, it takes about 0.7 seconds, including the time to check for matches (with a maximum of 32 matches per batch).Testing 2 million offsets would require approximately 16 days on a single GPU, or just 1 day using 16 GPUs.I also conducted tests using Runpod, and the RTX 4090 turned out to be the ideal option. Although it’s about 60% more expensive than the 3090, it’s also 2.3 times faster.With a 4090, the same process would take around 7 days on a single GPU.Using 16 GPUs, the process could be completed in just over 10 hours.From a cost perspective, the RTX 4090 is an excellent choice for this task due to several factors:Large memory is not required.Floating-point operations are not needed.The RTX 4090 offers a high number of CUDA cores, enhancing processing speed.The rental price for an RTX 4090 is relatively low compared to other high-end GPUs.If the 4090 is unavailable, the 3090 is also a good alternative considering its price-to-performance ratio.Initially, my client considered using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) machines and seeking a discount for a month-long rental. However, this option proved to be extremely expensive (costing tens of thousands of USD).After some research, I found more cost-effective alternatives: Runpod and Vast.ai.To brute force 1 second (1 billion nanosecond), with offset range of 2 million, it  will take 7 days. The cost for a RTX 4090 (at the time of this writing) is 0.69 USD/hour. It will cost around 116 USD to brute force a single second.  Renting 16 GPUs will have the work finished in around 10 hours, same cost, but faster.Brute forcing with the range of 4.5 million (which is the range that we need) costs 261 USD. Depending on the number of encrypted files, you might need to brute force 10 or more seconds. If you have a lot of files to recover, weekly or monthly rent will be cheaper.Note: These costs assume everything is executed perfectly. Any mistakes or the need to repeat processes can significantly increase costs.In total, including all my experiments and tests, I spent around $1,200.Unlike runpod, when using vast.ai, you are renting a machine from some random person brokered by vast.ai. When doing the bruteforce, no sensitive data is sent, so privacy should not be a concern.Using vast AI, the bruteforce cost  can be reduced to half, but this depends on your luck in obtaining the machine. The first few machines that I tested didn’t work (network timeout after around 10 minutes of waiting). I also had problem with pulling docker images from docker.io (I had to select another template from another docker repository).Now that I found the value of t3 and t4, I can try to find the value for t1 and t2. The value of t1 must be less than t3, and the time offset is less than 10 million nanoseconds. This can be found quickly in minutes using a single GPU.Here is the algorithm used to split the file into parts:enc_block_size: for every parts/blocks, this is how many bytes to encrypt. The first 0xFFFFF will be encrypted using KCipher2, and the rest using Chacha8part_size: the size of the blockencrypted_parts: how many blocks to encryptvoid compute_blocks(uint64_t filesize, 
    uint8_t percent,
    uint64_t *enc_block_size,
    uint64_t *part_size,
    uint64_t *encrypted_parts)
{
    int parts = 3;
    if ( percent > 49u )
        parts = 5;
    uint64_t enc_size = filesize * (uint64_t)percent / 100;
    *enc_block_size = enc_size / parts;
    *encrypted_parts = parts - 1;
    *part_size = (filesize - *enc_block_size * (*encrypted_parts)) / parts;  
}
The malware uses the 8 rounds variant of Chacha called chacha8, not Chacha20 as many sites reported.For kcipher2, we will encrypt the first 65535 bytes (yes, not 65536). It means that one byte will remain from the first block, and this needs to be used for the next blockFor cacha20, we just throw away the rest of the encryption stream block when starting a new blockTo recover your files without paying, it is not as straightforward as running a generic decryptor. You will need to:obtain timestamps of your filesobtain ciphertext and plaintext for your filesTo be honest, I originally wrote this code for one-time use, specifically for this particular client. The shared code is filled with experimental logic, quick hacks, and lacks proper testing.I don’t have the motivation to clean it up further, apart from removing some client-specific test cases and comments. It’s functional for the intended purpose.The software I provided includes only the main brute-force and decryption components, intended to be used once you have the necessary timestamps.I don’t have a dedicated system to manage multiple GPUs. Instead, I rely on basic shell scripting and a custom script that sends a Telegram message when a match is found. The code is “good enough for me” and simply “works for me.”In essence, you’ll need a capable system administrator who understands the process and knows how to manage and troubleshoot the system effectively.See README.md in the repository, it also has a sample config file to test that it works. Sample encrypted files and configuration files are also provided.I hope you haven’t touched the files, because all hope of recovery will be gone if the timestamps are unknown. Use  to get the modification timestamp. Use find /vmfs/volumes -exec stat {} \; > /tmp/stats.txt to get the timestamp of everything.The file  can help to figure out the minimum timestamp to use.Obtain the ciphertext, as explained above:For flat-vmdk, you need to extract this from the exact OS that you use (including the exact instalation method, e.g: using BIOS/UEFI)For sesparse file, use the header For other files, see what I wrote aboveYou can always just use an offset range of 1.5-5 million, but this may not be the correct range if your hardware is too fast or too slow. You can measure this by checking out the  folder and  folder on my github repository.The first one only measures time ranges by calling the function directly. The second one is used to encrypt a directory, but it is patched so that it will write down the exact time when the timestamp is used as the seed to .Create config files based on the ciphertext/plaintext and timestamp. You can create/split this manually, or use a script to generate it. My code doesn’t do any error checking, make sure the timestamp is in nanosecond format, make sure all plaintext and ciphertext values are correct.If you want a very quick and easy setup, use runpod or other service. If you want to be cheap, use vast.ai, or run it on your own hardware (~ 1K USD for one RTX 3090, which you can resell later).The first brute force is to find t3 and t4 for Kcipher. ./akira-bruteforce run2 config.jsonAppend GPU index if you have multiple GPUs./akira-bruteforce run2 config.json 1I suggest running it inside tmux, so you will be fine in the event of network disconnect.If we are lucky, output.txt will be generated for each t3/t4 found.This is not necessary for small files, but it is neede for big files. For each offset found, generate a config with the t3 found in the previous step. On my target machine, the distance between t1 and t3 is less than 10 million, and the t1 to t2 is  around 1.5 – 5 million. The brute force should only take around 10 minutes.Note that the decryptor has the percentage hardcoded to 15 percent, so please change this before running the decryptor in case the attacker uses different value.Once we have obtained the t1, t2, t3, and t4, run the decryptor:./decrypt filename.vmdk <t1> <t2> <t3> <t4>The decryption process is not optimized, so it will take a while to decrypt../anti-akira run config.json <gpuindex>As explained above: this may take days, so please make sure:all the config files are goodYou are using the correct GPU indexmake sure everything is runningcheck with nvidia-smi (with runpod, we can also view the GPU status using the web)make a notification system to alert you if output.txt is created/updatedProbably 99.9% of the time when you get a ransomware, it won’t be recoverable without the key. But if you are lucky, sometimes it is possible to find a solution. It took me much longer than I anticipated to solve this, I thought that it would take a week, but it took me almost three weeks until we recover an entire set of VM files.I also would like to add that I found a reddit thread about akira ransomware , I wasn’t sure that the ransomware strain that I have is the same as theirs, and that is the reason why I just continue my own research and to open source it. I hope that my experience and code will be useful for someone else. Everytime I wrote something about ransomware (in my Indonesian blog), many people will ask for ransomware help. Many people can’t even find the ransomware executable (just the encrypted file, which is not useful). Just checking if the ransomware is recoverable or not may take several hours with a lot of efforts (e.g: if the malware is obfuscated/protected). So please don’t ask me to do that for free. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI search engines cite incorrect sources at an alarming 60% rate, study says</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/dartboard_missed-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 21:16:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study from Columbia Journalism Review's Tow Center for Digital Journalism finds serious accuracy issues with generative AI models used for news searches.

The question raised in this post’s title seems to lie at the heart of the matter.  In this experiment, which I recently reviewed here, particles of some sort are aimed, one at a time, at a wall with two slits, and their arrival is recorded on a screen behind the wall. As a parade of particles proceeds, one by one, past the wall, an interference pattern somehow appears, emerging gradually like a spectre on the screen.Interference is a familiar effect, commonly seen in water waves and sound waves.  If water waves passed through a pair of slits in a wall, interference would be observed and no one would be surprised. But here we have one particle passing through the wall at a time; it’s not at all the same thing. How can we explain the interference effect in this case? It’s natural to imagine that somehow eithereach particle acts like a wave, goes through both slits, and interferes with itself, orthe quantum wave function that describes each particle (or all the particles [?]) goes through both slits and interferes with itself.So… which is it? Did the particle go through both slits, or did the wave function?In 1920s quantum physics, there is a very simple answer to this question.  No — neither the particle nor the wave function [not its wavy pattern or its peak(s) or any other part of it] goes through the two slits.What!? Then how can there be interference?That question I will answer in a later post, probably next week or the following. But first, let’s confront the title of this post in a simpler context, so that we can see clearly why — in 1920s quantum physics — the answer to its question is “neither one”.The Double Door ExperimentKey to understanding the double-slit experiment is to simplify it down to its bare essence. Having a two-dimensional problem where particles are going through slits in a wall is more complicated than necessary. Instead, let’s take a one-dimensional problem that we’ve already looked at, where an object is in a superposition state of going to the left  going to the right. We already saw that this object is  to be viewed as both going to the left AND going to the right. By setting up measurements on both sides, we saw that it can only be measured to be doing one or the other, and never both. Superposition is an , not an .  And a true particle can only have one position at a time.The Particle and the Doors: A First LookIn this context, let’s ask the question: can a particle simultaneously go through two doors on opposite sides of a room? This is the same question as the two-slit question, because I can turn one into the other using tubes behind the slits, as in Fig. 1.By sending a particle toward two slits, we can arrange for its wave function to be in the superposition state we want (Fig. 2)and then we can ask whether we can observe it going through both doors.Well, in a recent post we put two balls in the same locations that we now want to place the doors, and we asked if a particle in this very same superposition state can hit both balls simultaneously. The answer was “no”.  The same argument applies here; the particle cannot be observed to pass through both doors simultaneously. It can only go through one or the other.Why? A particle, which has a position and a momentum (even if unknown to us), cannot have  positions.  If it starts between the two doors, it can move through one door or the other, but it cannot do both, because then it would have two positions at once. Maybe you’re not immediately convinced.  If not, stay tuned, as I’ll come back to this again later. The Wave Function and the Doors: A First LookBut for now, let’s turn to the other question arising from my post’s title. Why can’t the particle’s wave function move through both doors, just like a water wave or sound wave does?Actually, since wave functions don’t move (they just describe particles that do) what we really want to know is slightly different.  The initial wave function has a wavy pattern; does this wavy pattern go through both doors?Certainly water waves and sound waves could go through both doors.  They are waves . So are the doors (or slits) they they can pass through. But the wave function is , and not in physical space. Conversely, the doors do not exist in the space of probabilities; doors are physical objects. Therefore the wave function (and its wavy patterns) cannot pass through the doors at all! The very idea is nonsensical, the sort of thing that René Magritte would have enjoyed painting.  Having the wave function (or its pattern) pass through physical doors would be akin to you entering into Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet to save the lovers from their fates, or enjoying the taste of an apple painted by Rembrandt, or walking through a giant hole in a physicist’s argument. Physical space and the space of possibilities are conceptually different; they have distinct meanings.  At best one space merely represents what is happening in the other.  And so the objects that exist in one don’t exist as objects in the other. (Even when these spaces have the same shape, which sometimes they do, they represent different things, as indicated in the fact that they have different axes.)To convince you further of these statements, let’s take a look at a simpler example. Consider a system where there is just a single door, but there are two particles. Let’s see why the wave function of these particles (and its wave pattern) can’t even pass through one door, much less two.The Wave Function of Two Particles and a Single DoorWe’ll put the door on the right in physical space. Superposition states aren’t needed here, so instead we’ll send  toward the door, in simple wave-packet states. These two particles will be given the same near-definite momentum, but their poorly known positions are shifted apart, so that they are separated in physical space. In pre-quantum language, the set-up is shown in Fig. 3.What wave function do we need to describe this? It’s simplest to put the two particles in wave packet states with near-definite momentum, somewhat separated in space but with similar motion. You might first think the wave function for such a system would roughly look like Fig. 4: That’s a trap that’s super-easy to fall into; such a wave function describes one particle in a superposition of two locations, not two particles. Instead, because the first particle has position  and the second has position  respectively, their wave function, a function that exists in  with axes  and , takes the form . If we start with  near 2 and  near 0, as in Fig. 3, then the wave function for these two particles looks like Fig. 5: it has a peak near  and . (The dashed black lines are just there to guide your eyes.)  The peak indicates that  near 2 and  near 0 are the most probable values for the two particles’ positions.Now, where’s the door that we want to try to make the wave function go through? Great question. In physical space it is located at . Let’s now draw that door in the space of possibilities, whose axes are  and .  How should we do that?That’s fine; there’s no reason not to be confused the first time you think about it.  Here’s the answer.Particle 1 goes through the door when , which is the vertical blue dashed line in Fig. 6. Meanwhile, particle 2 goes through it when , so that’s the horizontal blue dashed line.Does that look like a door to you? Certainly it doesn’t look like the door in physical space. And that’s because in the space of possibilities, the dashed lines are not a door, with mass and thickiness and a material make-up.  Instead the lines represent a certain set of possibilities, namely that one of the particles is  the physical door.In fact, there’s a special point, the intersection at  where the lines cross, that represents the possibility that both particles are simultaneously at the location of the door. No such intersection of lines exists in physical space.  This is an intersection of two classes of possibilities, and such a thing can only exist in the space of possibilities.The lines divide the space into four regions, representing four more general classes of possibilities, shown in Fig. 7. In the lower left region, both particles are to the left of the door. At far right, particle 1 is to the right of the door while particle 2 is to the left; the reverse is true in the upper left region. Finally, at upper right is the region where both particles are to the right of the door.The wave function’s pattern moves in the two dimensions that are spanned by the  and . axes. Both particles are moving to the right in physical space, at approximately the same speed. Consequently, the wave function, as it evolves, carries the most probable state of the system across three of the regions:initially both particles are to the left of the door then particle 1 is to the right of the door while particle 2 remains to the leftand finally both particles are to the right of the door.In pre-quantum physics the path traversed by the two-particle system would look like Fig. 8:The wave function evolves as shown in Fig. 9, very similarly to Fig. 8.Now, is the wave function going  the door? Again, there is no door here; there are simply lines that tell us when one particle is coincident with the door, as well as a point where both particles are coincident with the door. It’s true that the wavy pattern and the peak of the wave function (which indicates the possibilities where the system is most likely to be found are passing across the lines.  But can we say the wave function (or its wavy pattern) passes  the lines? No: moving through a door involves moving in physical space, along the -axis, through a gap in a door frame.  This is something the wave function does not — cannot — do.The Wave Function of Two Particles and Two DoorsIf you’re still not yet entirely convinced, consider what happens if we have two doors, one on each side. Let’s put our two particles each in a superposition state of moving leftward or moving rightward. Again we’ll set one particle off before the other, so that the first will reach the doors well before the second does.Our pre-quantum view of such as system is that it now has four possibilities: particle 1 can be going right or left, and particle 2 can be going right or left, as shown in Fig. 10.  Only the upper-right option appeared in Fig. 3.This requires a wave function that initially looks like Fig. 11, , one for each general possibility sketched in Fig. 10.But where are the two doors? They appear in the space of possibilities on  lines; in addition to the blue lines we had in Figs. 6-9, corresponding to particles 1 or 2 being at the righthand door, we now have two more, shown in green in Fig. 12, corresponding to one or the other particle being at the lefthand door.Notice the two intersections between the blue and green lines! What are these?! No such intersections between the doors can possibly occur in physical space. So this makes it even clearer that these lines cannot be identified with the doors. What do these two intersections actually represent?  The upper left intersection combines the possibility that particle 1 is at the left door and simultaneously particle 2 is at the right door.  It’s the other way around at the lower right intersection.Note there is no intersection, or any point at all, corresponding to particle 1 being at the left door and simultaneously being at the right door. Indeed, such a point would have , which is impossible; every point in the space of possibilities has a unique value of .How does the wave function behave over time? It behaves as shown in Fig. 13:What are the four peaks, and what are they doing? They correspond to the four possibilities shown in Fig. 10. Clockwise from the rightmost peak (which appeared in Fig. 9,) particle 1 goes through the right door, followed by particle 2. particle 1 goes through the right door, after which particle 2 goes through the left door. particle 1 goes through the left door, followed by particle 2. particle 1 goes through the left door, after which particle 2 goes through the right door.You can tell which is which by looking at which colored line is crossed first, and which is crossed second, by each peak.Any one of these four things may happen. Two, or more, may not. And not one of them includes the possibility that either particle goes through both doors simultaneously.As another instructive variation, suppose we send particles 1 and 2 off at exactly the same moment. Then the wave function, shown in Fig. 13, looks very similar to Fig. 12, except that every peak goes through an intersection of the dashed lines, because the two particles arrive at the doors simultaneously. Again there are four possibilities, both particles can arrive at the right door simultaneously, both can arrive at the left door simultaneously,particle 1 can arrive at the left door just as the particle 2 arrives at the right doorAnd so it certainly  possible for particle 1 to go through the left door and particle 2 to go through the right door simultaneously. No problem with that. However, it is simply impossible — illogical, in fact — for particle 1 to go through both doors simultaneously. There’s no spot in the space of possibilities that could even represent that inconsistent scenario.Lessons for the Double Slit ExperimentThe lesson? Many fascinating things happen in quantum physics once we have superpositions and multiple particles and multiple doors. But two things that cannot happen (in 1920’s quantum physics) include the following:No particle can go through two doors at once; it can have only one position at a time.No wave function, living as it does in the space of possibilities, can pass through any door in physical space.The same applies for the two slits in the quantum double-slit experiment. One cannot make sense of that experiment without learning this lesson: from the viewpoint of 1920’s quantum physics, the interference effects do not arise from any object, whether particle or wave function or pattern in the wave function, physically moving through the physical slits in physical space.So where do the interference effects come from?  The wave function’s pattern  travel across regions of possibility space that are  with the slits.  We need to work out the consequences of this observation, and interpret it properly.  Stay tuned to this channel; the answer is near at hand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>City simulator I made in Scratch</title><link>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1061728417/</link><author>Annulus</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:46:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>North Korea’s ScarCruft Deploys KoSpy Malware, Spying on Android Users via Fake Utility Apps</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/north-koreas-scarcruft-deploys-kospy.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1Ph61Fp86lZZi5iTSnMuK7QWC0lD48gbdpw61TI3DuBnkql0qVoodLmY1CAgWvdNCTTRwJYe4q3OnDA33-kXENzSKrjZ12jRHq74b2GQqaN9_BfGpRTMzmF2Gs2knCyYDr5iO5QLvPduXJJdNzS6s7iL9Xl3tWAknS9SbeGO6zpTa1dyOZdOF7RsC9KtV/s1600/northkorea.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:23:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The North Korea-linked threat actor known as ScarCruft is said to have been behind a never-before-seen Android surveillance tool named KoSpy targeting Korean and English-speaking users.

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTS5o8uYGpY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cTS5o8uYGpY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?” We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&T’s central office in San Francisco, called Room 641A. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—made a copy of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.A photo of the NSA-controlled 'secret room' in the AT&T facility in San Francisco (Credit: Mark Klein)Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator Chris Dodd, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tourMark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013. But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.And the fight is not over. The law, called Section 702, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy.

The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, maybe not always), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a moonshot goal of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its Gemini 2.0 large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>N.T.

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peer-to-peer file transfers in the browser</title><link>https://github.com/kern/filepizza</link><author>keepamovin</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over 400 IPs Exploiting Multiple SSRF Vulnerabilities in Coordinated Cyber Attack</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/over-400-ips-exploiting-multiple-ssrf.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8wt2gOO6tQC7VAbHWRY9h8r1ysrD6Ne7ctN-ghRHGpXdtM6RBsiG4d49AvQ1A2oemjCusruXzhTEAbbNXv095-qG0KiGOLruAFLagWIPEhSDq_mCklU0qfPr6iEa6bg7MERMLjvN4i9ChCwhFHGiW_G22LsWgW70YSzk7F9dngPZAT_HJXpiTXk685daR/s1600/code.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise is warning of a "coordinated surge" in the exploitation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities spanning multiple platforms.

They were launched on April 15th, June 12th and November 11th, 2023 respectively.There are ~130 GB of GeoTIFFs being hosted in their AWS S3 bucket in Montreal. The 33 images posted were taken between June and two weeks ago.In this post, I'll examine Wyvern's open data feed.I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and I use ArcGIS Pro from time to time which only supports Windows natively.I'll use GDAL 3.9.3, Python 3.12.3 and a few other tools to help analyse the data in this post.$sudoadd-apt-repositoryppa:deadsnakes/ppa

The maps in this post were rendered with QGIS version 3.42. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.I used QGIS' Tile+ plugin to add geospatial context with Bing's Virtual Earth Basemap as well as CARTO's to the maps. The dark, non-satellite imagery maps are mostly made up of vector data from Natural Earth and Overture.Below is PulseOrbital's list of estimated Tallinn flyovers by Wyvern's Dragonette constellation for March 8th and 9th, 2025.Below I'll try to estimate the current locations of each of their three satellites. I found the Two-line elements (TLE) details on n2yo.I ran the following on March 10th, 2025. It produced a CSV file with names and estimated locations of their three satellites. \
                                   \
                                   \
                                  Below is a rendering of the above CSV data in QGIS.Wyvern have a STAC catalog listing the imagery locations and metadata around their capture. I'll download this metadata and get each image's address details with Mapbox's reverse geocoding service. Mapbox offer 100K geocoding searches per month with their free tier.The above produced a 33-line JSONL file. Below is an example record.$head-n1enriched.jsonjq-S.
I'll load their imagery metadata into DuckDB for analysis.Below are the image counts by country and city. Some areas are rural and Mapbox didn't attribute any city to the image footprint's location.┌──────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐

into opening a file other than the one it intended.
This post explains this class of vulnerability,
some existing defenses against it, and describes how the new
 API added in Go 1.24 provides
a simple and robust defense against unintentional path traversal.“Path traversal” covers a number of related attacks following a common pattern:
A program attempts to open a file in some known location, but an attacker causes
it to open a file in a different location.If the attacker controls part of the filename, they may be able to use relative
directory components ("..") to escape the intended location:f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "../../../../etc/passwd"))
On Windows systems, some names have special meaning:// f will print to the console.
f, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "CONOUT$"))
If the attacker controls part of the local filesystem, they may be able to use
symbolic links to cause a program to access the wrong file:// Attacker links /home/user/.config to /home/otheruser/.config:
err := os.WriteFile("/home/user/.config/foo", config, 0o666)
If the program defends against symlink traversal by first verifying that the intended file
does not contain any symlinks, it may still be vulnerable to
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) races,
where the attacker creates a symlink after the program’s check:// Validate the path before use.
cleaned, err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(unsafePath)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
if !filepath.IsLocal(cleaned) {
  return errors.New("unsafe path")
}

// Attacker replaces part of the path with a symlink.
// The Open call follows the symlink:
f, err := os.Open(cleaned)
Another variety of TOCTOU race involves moving a directory that forms part of a path
mid-traversal. For example, the attacker provides a path such as “a/b/c/../../etc/passwd”,
and renames “a/b/c” to “a/b” while the open operation is in progress.Before we tackle path traversal attacks in general, let’s start with path sanitization.
When a program’s threat model does not include attackers with access to the local file system,
it can be sufficient to validate untrusted input paths before use.Unfortunately, sanitizing paths can be surprisingly tricky,
especially for portable programs that must handle both Unix and Windows paths.
For example, on Windows  reports ,
because the path “\foo” is relative to the current drive.In Go 1.20, we added the 
function, which reports whether a path is “local”. A “local” path is one which:does not escape the directory in which it is evaluated ("../etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not an absolute path ("/etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not empty ("" is not allowed);on Windows, is not a reserved name (“COM1” is not allowed).In Go 1.23, we added the 
function, which converts a /-separated path into a local operating system path.Programs that accept and operate on potentially attacker-controlled paths should almost
always use  or  to validate or sanitize those paths.Path sanitization is not sufficient when attackers may have access to part of
the local filesystem.Multi-user systems are uncommon these days, but attacker access to the filesystem
can still occur in a variety of ways.
An unarchiving utility that extracts a tar or zip file may be induced
to extract a symbolic link and then extract a file name that traverses that link.
A container runtime may give untrusted code access to a portion of the local filesystem.Programs may defend against unintended symlink traversal by using the
path/filepath.EvalSymlinks
function to resolve links in untrusted names before validation, but as described
above this two-step process is vulnerable to TOCTOU races.Before Go 1.24, the safer option was to use a package such as
github.com/google/safeopen,
that provides path traversal-resistant functions for opening a potentially-untrusted
filename within a specific directory.In Go 1.24, we are introducing new APIs in the  package to safely open
a file in a location in a traversal-resistent fashion.The new  type represents a directory somewhere
in the local filesystem. Open a root with the 
function:root, err := os.OpenRoot("/some/root/directory")
if err != nil {
  return err
}
defer root.Close()
 provides methods to operate on files within the root.
These methods all accept filenames relative to the root,
and disallow any operations that would escape from the root either
using relative path components ("..") or symlinks.f, err := root.Open("path/to/file")
 permits relative path components and symlinks that do not escape the root.
For example,  is permitted. Filenames are resolved using the
semantics of the local platform: On Unix systems, this will follow
any symlink in “a” (so long as that link does not escape the root);
while on Windows systems this will open “b” (even if “a” does not exist). currently provides the following set of operations:func (*Root) Create(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) Lstat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
func (*Root) Mkdir(string, fs.FileMode) error
func (*Root) Open(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenFile(string, int, fs.FileMode) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenRoot(string) (*Root, error)
func (*Root) Remove(string) error
func (*Root) Stat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
In addition to the  type, the new
 function
provides a simple way to open a potentially-untrusted filename within a
specific directory:f, err := os.OpenInRoot("/some/root/directory", untrustedFilename)
The  type provides a simple, safe, portable API for operating with untrusted filenames.Caveats and considerationsOn Unix systems,  is implemented using the  family of system calls.
A  contains a file descriptor referencing its root directory and will track that
directory across renames or deletion. defends against symlink traversal but does not limit traversal
of mount points. For example,  does not prevent traversal of
Linux bind mounts. Our threat model is that  defends against
filesystem constructs that may be created by ordinary users (such
as symlinks), but does not handle ones that require root privileges
to create (such as bind mounts).On Windows,  opens a handle referencing its root directory.
The open handle prevents that directory from being renamed or deleted until the  is closed. prevents access to reserved Windows device names such as  and .On WASI, the  package uses the WASI preview 1 filesystem API,
which are intended to provide traversal-resistent filesystem access.
Not all WASI implementations fully support filesystem sandboxing,
however, and ’s defense against traversal is limited to that provided
by the WASI impementation.When GOOS=js, the  package uses the Node.js file system API.
This API does not include the openat family of functions,
and so  is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) races in symlink
validation on this platform.When GOOS=js, a  references a directory name rather than a file descriptor,
and does not track directories across renames.Plan 9 does not have symlinks.
On Plan 9, a  references a directory name and performs lexical sanitization of
filenames. operations on filenames containing many directory components can be much more expensive
than the equivalent non- operation. Resolving “..” components can also be expensive.
Programs that want to limit the cost of filesystem operations can use  to
remove “..” components from input filenames, and may want to limit the number of
directory components.You should use  or  if:you are opening a file in a directory; ANDthe operation should not access a file outside that directory.For example, an archive extractor writing files to an output directory should use
, because the filenames are potentially untrusted and it would be incorrect
to write a file outside the output directory.However, a command-line program that writes output to a user-specified location
should not use , because the filename is not untrusted and may
refer to anywhere on the filesystem.As a good rule of thumb, code which calls  to combine a fixed directory
and an externally-provided filename should probably use  instead.// This might open a file not located in baseDirectory.
f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(baseDirectory, filename))

// This will only open files under baseDirectory.
f, err := os.OpenInRoot(baseDirectory, filename)
The  API is new in Go 1.24.
We expect to make additions and refinements to it in future releases.The current implementation prioritizes correctness and safety over performance.
Future versions will take advantage of platform-specific APIs, such as
Linux’s , to improve performance where possible.There are a number of filesystem operations which  does not support yet, such as
creating symbolic links and renaming files. Where possible, we will add support for these
operations. A list of additional functions in progress is in
go.dev/issue/67002.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft: 6 Zero-Days in March 2025 Patch Tuesday</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/microsoft-6-zero-days-in-march-2025-patch-tuesday/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:53:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ today issued more than 50 security updates for its various  operating systems, including fixes for a whopping six zero-day vulnerabilities that are already seeing active exploitation.Two of the zero-day flaws include CVE-2025-24991 and CVE-2025-24993, both vulnerabilities in , the default file system for Windows and Windows Server. Both require the attacker to trick a target into mounting a malicious virtual hard disk. CVE-2025-24993 would lead to the possibility of local code execution, while CVE-2025-24991 could cause NTFS to disclose portions of memory.Microsoft credits researchers at  with reporting the zero-day bug labeled CVE-2025-24983, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in older versions of Windows. ESET said the exploit was deployed via the PipeMagic backdoor, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine.ESET’s said the exploit in the wild targets only older versions of Windows OS: Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. Although still used by millions, security support for these products ended more than a year ago, and mainstream support ended years ago. However, ESET notes the vulnerability itself also is present in newer Windows OS versions, including  and the still-supported .Rapid7’s lead software engineer  said  and  onwards are not listed as receiving patches, so are presumably not vulnerable.“It’s not clear why newer Windows products dodged this particular bullet,” Barnett wrote. “The Windows 32 subsystem is still presumably alive and well, since there is no apparent mention of its demise on the Windows client OS deprecated features list.”The zero-day flaw CVE-2025-24984 is another NTFS weakness that can be exploited by inserting a malicious USB drive into a Windows computer. Barnett said Microsoft’s advisory for this bug doesn’t quite join the dots, but successful exploitation appears to mean that portions of heap memory could be improperly dumped into a log file, which could then be combed through by an attacker hungry for privileged information.“A relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 4.6 reflects the practical difficulties of real-world exploitation, but a motivated attacker can sometimes achieve extraordinary results starting from the smallest of toeholds, and Microsoft does rate this vulnerability as important on its own proprietary severity ranking scale,” Barnett said.Another zero-day fixed this month — CVE-2025-24985 — could allow attackers to install malicious code. As with the NTFS bugs, this one requires that the user mount a malicious virtual hard drive.The final zero-day this month is CVE-2025-26633, a weakness in the Microsoft Management Console, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system. Exploiting this flaw requires the target to open a malicious file.This month’s bundle of patch love from Redmond also addresses six other vulnerabilities Microsoft has rated “critical,” meaning that malware or malcontents could exploit them to seize control over vulnerable PCs with no help from users.Barnett observed that this is now the sixth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication.The SANS Internet Storm Center has a useful list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.

An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg News found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stole more than 3,000 files in that intrusion.The indictments highlight how, in some cases, the hackers operated with a surprising degree of autonomy, even choosing targets on their own before selling stolen information to Chinese government clients. The indictment against Yin Kecheng, who was previously sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January for his involvement in the Treasury breach, quotes from his communications with a colleague in which he notes his personal preference for hacking American targets and how he’s seeking to ‘break into a big target,’ which he hoped would allow him to make enough money to buy a car.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2287 - Josh Dubin &amp; J.D.

Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the Lithuanian national , 46, was apprehended while vacationing on the coast of India with his family.Aleksej Bešciokov, “proforg,” “iram”. Image: U.S. Secret Service.On March 7, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and the other alleged co-founder of Garantex, , 40, a Russian national living in the United Arab Emirates.Launched in 2019, Garantex was first sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2022 for receiving hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, including funds used to facilitate hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Since those penalties were levied, Garantex has processed more than $60 billion, according to the blockchain analysis company “Garantex has been used in sanctions evasion by Russian elites, as well as to launder proceeds of crime including ransomware, darknet market trade and thefts attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group,” Elliptic wrote in a blog post. “Garantex has also been implicated in enabling Russian oligarchs to move their wealth out of the country, following the invasion of Ukraine.”The DOJ alleges Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda is allegedly Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.In conjunction with the release of the indictments, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. A “most wanted” notice published by the  states that U.S. authorities separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. Federal investigators say they also froze over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.Besciokov was arrested within the past 24 hours while vacationing with his family in Varkala, a major coastal city in the southwest Indian state of Kerala. An officer with the local police department in Varkala confirmed Besciokov’s arrest, and said the suspect will appear in a Delhi court on March 14 to face charges.Varkala Beach in Kerala, India.

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happy 20th birthday, Y Combinator</title><link>https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1899092996702048709</link><author>btilly</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RubyLLM: A delightful Ruby way to work with AI</title><link>https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm</link><author>ksec</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:40:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ballista Botnet Exploits Unpatched TP-Link Vulnerability, Targets Over 6,000 Devices</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/ballista-botnet-exploits-unpatched-tp.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqB-Ta2yVkMau7nK93NiWr1lVC6nvIDRU4yywdjf1BPScT57QUcDKTbnV0PtIA2ghJBhIH8izkKCwkKf5j1g_rIXNIUG822Gxwf-cE-eOFYNDe6hqZi3V9RoriHMz99cqii68l15COLdWTXCZTsAWZFDRXy687S2yrbeWzy5lP_ZOXWezZtobyNfCf_Ee3/s1600/router-hacking.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unpatched TP-Link Archer routers have become the target of a new botnet campaign dubbed Ballista, according to new findings from the Cato CTRL team.

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker
- Python 3.10+The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to balance paying debt vs. investing</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9vPm615xnY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/a9vPm615xnY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing.

This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

which was only released a few weeks ago!
Early adopters to integrate Kuzu-Wasm include Alibaba Graphscope, see: 1
and 2, and Kineviz, whose project will be launched soon.In this post, we’ll showcase the potential of Kuzu-Wasm by building a fully in-browser chatbot
that answers questions over LinkedIn data using an advanced retrieval technique: Graph
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG). This is achieved using Kuzu-Wasm
alongside WebLLM, a popular in-browser LLM inference engine that can
run LLMs inside the browser.A quick introduction to WebAssemblyWebAssembly (Wasm) has transformed browsers into general-purpose computing platforms.
Many fundamental software components, such as full-fledged databases, machine learning
libraries, data visualization tools, and encryption/decryption libraries, now have Wasm versions.
This enables developers to build advanced applications that run entirely in users’
browsers—without requiring backend servers. There are several benefits for building fully
in-browser applications:y: Users’ data never leaves their devices, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality.: An in-browser application that uses Wasm-based components
can run in any browser in a completely serverless manner.: Eliminating frontend-server communication can lead to a significantly faster and
more interactive user experience.With this in mind, let’s now demonstrate how to develop a relatively complex AI application completely in
the browser! We’ll build a  chatbot that uses graph retrieval- augmented
generation (Graph RAG) to answer natural language questions. We demonstrate this using
Kuzu-Wasm and WebLLM.The high-level architecture of the application looks as follows:
The term “Graph RAG” is used to refer to several techniques but in its simplest form the term
refers to a 3-step retrieval approach. The goal is to retrieve useful context from a graph DBMS (GDBMS)
to help an LLM answer natural language questions.
In our application, the additional data is information about
a user’s LinkedIn data consisting of their contacts, messages, companies the user or their contacts worked for. Yes, you can download
your own LinkedIn data (and you should, if
for nothing else, to see how much of your data they have!).
The schema of the graph database we use to model this data will be shown below momentarily. First, let’s go over the 3 steps of
Graph RAG:Q Q: A user asks a natural language question Q, such as “Which of my contacts work at Google?“.
Then, using an LLM, this question is converted to a Cypher query, e.g., MATCH (a:Company)<-[:WorksAt]-(b:Contact) WHERE a.name = "Google" RETURN b,
that aims to retrieve relevant data stored in the GDBMS to answer this question.Q Context: Q is executed in the GBMS and a set of records is retrieved, e.g., “Karen” and “Alice”. Let’s call these retrieved records “Context”.(Q + Context)  A: Finally, the original Q is given to the LLM along with the retrieved context and the LLM produces a natural language answer A,
e.g., “Karen and Alice work at Google.”The schema for our personal LinkedIn data’s graph is shown below:Upload CSV Files: Users drag and drop their LinkedIn CSV files, which are stored in Kuzu-Wasm’s virtual file system.Initial Processing: Using Kuzu’s  feature, the raw CSVs are converted into JavaScript objects.Normalization: In JavaScript, we clean and standardize the data by fixing timestamps, formatting dates, and resolving inconsistent URIs.Data Insertion: The cleaned data is inserted back into Kuzu-Wasm as a set of nodes and relationships.Our code follows the exact 3 steps above. Specifically, we prompt WebLLM twice, once to create a Cypher query Q,
which is sent to Kuzu-Wasm.
We adapted the prompts from our LangChain-Kuzu integration,
with a few modifications. Importantly, we make sure to include the schema information of the LinkedIn database from Kuzu in the prompt, which helps the LLM better understand
the structure and relationships (including the directionality of the relationships) in the dataset.In this example, we represented the schema as YAML instead of raw, stringified JSON in the LLM prompt.
In our anecdotal experience, for Text-to-Cypher tasks that require reasoning over the schema, we find that LLMs tend do better
with YAML syntax than they do with stringified JSON. More experiments on such Text-to-Cypher tasks will be shown in future blog posts.It’s indeed impressive to see such a graph-based pipeline with LLMs being done entirely in the browser! There are, however, some caveats.
Most importantly, in the browser, resources are restricted, which limits the sizes of different components of your application.
For example, the size of the LLM you can use is limited. We tested our implementation on a MacBook Pro 2023 and a Chrome browser.
We had to choose the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC model (see here for the model card),
which is an instruction-tuned model in MLC format. The  format is the smallest of the Llama 3.1 models that has 8B parameters
(the largest has 450B parameters, which is of course too large to run in the browser).
For simple queries, the model performed quite well. It correctly generated Cypher queries for the LinkedIn data, such as:How many companies did I follow?Which contacts work at Kùzu, Inc?However, we saw that for more complex queries requiring joins, filtering, and aggregation, the model struggled to return a valid Cypher query.
It often produced incorrect or incomplete Cypher queries for questions like: “Who endorsed me the most times?“.
Token generation is also far slower than what you may be used to in state-of-the art interfaces,
such as ChatGPT. In our experiments, we observed a speed of 15-20 tokens/sec, so generating answers took on average, around 10s.We have deployed this demo so you can test it in your browser:Live Demo: Drag and drop your LinkedIn data dump into
the app and start querying your personal graph. The demo also visualizes your data in a node-link graph view using GitHub Repository: The source code is openly available so you can experiment with it further. If you see better results with different models/prompts, we’d love to hear it!Once the data is loaded, you can see a visualization that looks something like this:The key takeaway from this post is that such advanced pipelines that utilize graph databases and LLMs are now possible .
We expect that many of the performance limitations of today will improve over time, with the wider adoption of WebGPU,
Wasm64, and other proposals
to improve Wasm. LLMs are also rapidly getting smaller & better, and before we know it, it will be possible to use very advanced LLMs
in the browser. The next release of Kuzu will include a native vector index (it’s already available
in our nightly build; see this PR for how to use it!).
As a result, you can also store the embeddings of documents
along with actual node and relationship records to enhance your graph retrievals, entirely within Kuzu.
Using our upcoming vector index,
you’ll be able to try all sorts of interesting RAG techniques, coupled with Kuzu-Wasm, all within the browser while keeping your data private.

Europe doesn’t make enough—or in some cases any—of the air-defense systems or long-range rocket artillery that Ukraine relies on like the Patriot and ATACMS.

WSJ breaks down whether European NATO countries have the money, equipment and personnel to fill the gap.

When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.At the end, I will reflect on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug wasn’t fixed as of publishing this post, although it since has been); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison reproduced the 10% speedup “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from .Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a Raptor Lake i5-13500 I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds using my  configuration, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos. (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some  tuning flags which work around the regression.I’ve used  as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by /. You can find the complete output files and reports on github.Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.You’ll notice I didn’t benchmark the tail-call interpreter on the older Clang release (what would be ). The tail-call interpreter relies on new compiler features which only landed in Clang 19, meaning we can’t test it on earlier versions. This interaction, I think, is a big reason this story was so confusing, and why it took me so many benchmarks to be  I understood the situation.A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a  statement inside of a  loop, looking something like so:Most compilers will compile the  into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each  block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.It’s long been known that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a , each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.Modern C compilers support taking the address of labels, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the s in the latter code into a  LLVM instruction, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the -based interpreter!Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch  into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, in an old LLVM blog post introducing the new implementation.The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many  instructions can be quite expensive.In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented some limits on tail-duplication pass, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed -based implementation! This bug was first identified by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if you fix it, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the  of the regression.Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from 20% to 100%. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, more recent work finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single  statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):Notice that " is only 2% slower than , even though the base  build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.I haven’t mentioned the  benchmark, which you may notice claims to be  than " It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:Compiles the  into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotosCompiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic  graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, andIs able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatchThose facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the -based interpreter, and have the  do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” -based interpreter, goes ahead and duplicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the  test from earlier:Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the , but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.LLVM pull request 114990 merged shortly after I published this post, and fixes the regression. I was able to benchmark it before merge and confirm it restores the expected performance.For releases before that fix, the PR that caused the regression added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number.I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is  and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.Once you have metrics for  system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there  a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.On software engineering One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.And probably that  situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that  regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were  trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.Our compilers typically only  to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” -based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those  binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on the  attribute, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature.  does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the ; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) [[clang::musttailduplicate]] attribute on the interpreter  loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.I want to close with a call-out of how helpful  was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked  of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (, , , and ) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m  I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.Using , I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence  any given build in my  store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is shockingly concise; here’s a taste:I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required all of about 10 lines of code.That said, not everything was rosy. For one,  is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter. I’ve handled that one, but are there more?In addition, Nix is incredibly extensible and customizable, but figuring out how to make a specific customization can be a real uphill battle, and involve a lot of trial and error and source-diving. My patched LLVM build ended up being pretty short and clean, but getting there required me to read a lot of  source code, mixing and matching two under-documented extensibility mechanisms ( and  – not to be confused with , used elsewhere), and one failed attempt which successfully patched , but then silently built a new  against the unpatched version.Still,  was clearly enormously helpful here, and on net it definitely made this kind of multi-version exploration and debugging  saner than any other approach I can imagine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SilentCryptoMiner Infects 2,000 Russian Users via Fake VPN and DPI Bypass Tools</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/silentcryptominer-infects-2000-russian.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlu8Ua9uWPOrUKGR8PG82k6pG9XkdLrBPim6QAfkkQVjA_kNJrbsCKq8KS5B3s1k62BtdC0xQstKgdDBGWqha7tN7nSbvGmjIlGMmVvEoifZ345XRhrhl2WeCEcVzK_q2B8DFI3X7-elMkFpTzTjUyO_nXV4kpywYNuA1AUe_L1dJggBLFwetMH1ReGRRc/s1600/malware-attack.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 04:12:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new mass malware campaign is infecting users with a cryptocurrency miner named SilentCryptoMiner by masquerading it as a tool designed to circumvent internet blocks and restrictions around online services.

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kill your Feeds – Stop letting algorithms dictate what you think</title><link>https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</link><author>tom_usher</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:11:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tom McLeish - Cosmology and Creation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwU_xc3VYZ4</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FwU_xc3VYZ4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Show your support for the show with a Closer To Truth merch purchase: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Feds Link $150M Cyberheist to 2022 LastPass Hacks</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 01:20:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from security researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service  in 2022. In a court filing this week, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.On March 6, federal prosecutors in northern California said they seized approximately $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies that were clawed back following a $150 million cyberheist on Jan. 30, 2024. The complaint refers to the person robbed only as “Victim-1,” but according to blockchain security researcher  the theft was perpetrated against , the co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform . ZachXBT was the first to report on the heist.This week’s action by the government merely allows investigators to officially seize the frozen funds. But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the  and the  agree with the findings of the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023.That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,” reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. “From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims’ online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims’ electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.”“Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1’s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.”Working with dozens of victims, security researchers  and  found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase — the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings — in the “Secure Notes” area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.“The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,” the government wrote. “For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.”Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof — from federal investigators or others — that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.“Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,” LastPass said in a written statement. “To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.”On August 25, 2022, LastPass CEO Karim Toubba told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.Experts say the breach would have given thieves “offline” access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass’s oldest customers. That’s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer “iterations,” which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company’s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.Asked about LastPass’s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.“While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,” Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. “It’s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I’d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and SEAL 911 reported yet another wave of thefts as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.”Monahan said LastPass still hasn’t alerted their customers that their secrets—especially those stored in “Secure Notes”—may be at risk.“Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,” Monahan said. “They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could’ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But  instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI tools are spotting errors in research papers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00648-5</link><author>kgwgk</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:54:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Loyalty Cards</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/03/friday-squid-blogging-squid-loyalty-cards.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:04:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Security News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly 1 million Windows devices targeted in advanced “malvertising” spree</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/nearly-1-million-windows-devices-targeted-in-advanced-malvertising-spree/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/warning-alert-screen-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 20:23:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly 1 million Windows devices were targeted in recent months by a sophisticated "malvertising" campaign that surreptitiously stole login credentials, cryptocurrency, and other sensitive information from infected machines, Microsoft said.The campaign began in December, when the attackers, who remain unknown, seeded websites with links that downloaded ads from malicious servers. The links led targeted machines through several intermediary sites until finally arriving at repositories on Microsoft-owned GitHub, which hosted a raft of malicious files.The malware was loaded in four stages, each of which acted as a building block for the next. Early stages collected device information, presumably to tailor configurations for the later ones. Later ones disabled malware detection apps and connected to command-and-control servers; affected devices remained infected even after being rebooted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to Surveillance</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/first-porn-now-skin-cream-age-verification-bills-are-out-control</link><author>hn_acker</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 18:34:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to SurveillanceThe Problem with Age Verification: No Solution Is Safeno method of age verification is both privacy-protective and entirely accurate]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is This the Scariest Sound in Space?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqSwTC0UtRI</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rqSwTC0UtRI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 18:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The universe is far from silent.

As the current director of information technology at  and an early hire at , , and , Spikes is also among Musk’s most loyal employees. Here’s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon’s cousin.The profile of Branden Spikes on X.When President Trump took office again in January, he put the world’s richest man — Elon Musk — in charge of the , and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by at least 50 technologists, many of whom have ties to Musk’s companies.DOGE has been enabling the president’s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.In 2012, Spikes launched , a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or “sandboxed” web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk’s profile in Spike’s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.Spikes’s LinkedIn profile says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk’s inner circle of trust.In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.“Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,” Spikes said. “This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.”Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.“I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,” Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. “After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.”Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named  whom he’d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.Branden and Natalia’s names are both on the registration records for the domain name . This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the California Russian Association.Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its “White Nights” charity fundraisers:Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011. The man on the far right is Ivan Y. Podvalov, a board member of the Kremlin-aligned Congress of Russian Americans (CRA). The man in the center is Feodor Yakimoff, director of operations at the Transib Global Sourcing Group, and chairman of the Russian Imperial Charity Balls, which works in concert with the Russian Heritage Foundation.In 2011, the Spikes couple got divorced, and Natalia changed her last name to Haldeman. That is not her maiden name, which appears to be “Libina.” Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk’s cousin. is the son of , who is the brother of Elon Musk’s mother, . Divorce records show Reeve and Natalia officially terminated their marriage in 2007. Reeve Haldeman did not respond to a request for comment.A review of other domain names connected to Natalia Haldeman’s email address show she has registered more than a dozen domains over the years that are tied to the California Russian Association, and an apparently related entity called the Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc.:russianamericans.org

Podvalov is a board member of the Congress of Russian Americans (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.Writing for  in 2022, journalist  described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the “large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.”“The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO’s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.“One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,” Fishman wrote. “The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow’s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.”The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com reports that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as Constellation of Humanity.The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of the Russian Orthodox Church. This page indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.A press release from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation donated money to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.A review of the “Partners” listed on the Spikes’ jointly registered domain — orangetearoom.com — shows the organization worked with a marketing company called . Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service , which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.When asked about his ex-wife’s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.“I attended several of Natalia’s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she’s got the best intentions with those,” Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. “There’s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they’re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.”Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom’s side, and Jessie James on his dad’s side.“My family roots are about as American as you can get,” he said. “I’ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon’s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.”Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the “special government employee” Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the “wood chipper,” and who recently wielded an actual chainsaw on stage while referring to it as the “chainsaw for bureaucracy.”“Elon’s intentions are good and you can trust him,” Spikes assured.A special note of thanks for research assistance goes to , an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CMU research shows compression alone may unlock AI puzzle-solving abilities</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/compression_illustration_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:22:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently discovered hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples. Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine-learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities."Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?" ask Isaac Liao, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor, Professor Albert Gu, from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created CompressARC and published the results in a comprehensive post on Liao's website.The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine-learning researcher François Chollet to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills. ARC presents systems with grid-based image puzzles where each provides several examples demonstrating an underlying rule, and the system must infer that rule to apply it to a new example.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
