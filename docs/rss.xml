Barnum writes: "A high-school senior from New Jersey doesn't want the world to know that she cheated her way through English, math and history classes last year. Yet her experience, which the 17-year-old told The Wall Street Journal with her parent's permission, shows how generative AI has rooted in America's education system, allowing a generation of students to outsource their schoolwork to software with access to the world's knowledge. [...] The New Jersey student told the Journal why she used AI for dozens of assignments last year: Work was boring or difficult. She wanted a better grade. A few times, she procrastinated and ran out of time to complete assignments. The student turned to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, to help spawn ideas and review concepts, which many teachers allow. More often, though, AI completed her work. Gemini solved math homework problems, she said, and aced a take-home test. ChatGPT did calculations for a science lab. It produced a tricky section of a history term paper, which she rewrote to avoid detection. The student was caught only once." Not surprisingly, AI companies play up the idea that AI will radically improve learning, while educators are more skeptical. "This is a gigantic public experiment that no one has asked for," said Marc Watkins, assistant director of academic innovation at the University of Mississippi.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta takes aim at ex-employee’s memoir ‘Careless People’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/meta-takes-aim-at-ex-employees-memoir-careless-people/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 21:10:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meta won a legal victory this week against Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former employee who recently published a memoir of her time at the company titled “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.” An arbitrator ruled that the company has made a valid argument that Wynn-Williams, who worked at Facebook (now Meta) […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

(Specifically the Vice President said "There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns, allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise.") 

The article adds that TikTok owner ByteDance "has not publicly confirmed negotiations with any potential U.S. buyer, nor has it confirmed its willingness to sell TikTok to a U.S. bidder." But ByteDance "favors" a deal with Oracle, according to an X.com post on Thursday from tech-publication The Information. 

And today Politico adds that Oracle "is accelerating talks with the White House on a deal to run TikTok, though significant concerns remain about what role the app's Chinese founders will play in its ongoing U.S. operation, according to three people familiar with the discussions."

[Oracle's discussions are happening] amid ongoing warnings from congressional Republicans and other China hawks that any new ownership deal — if it keeps TikTok's underlying technology in Chinese hands — could be only a surface-level fix to the security concerns that led to last year's sweeping bipartisan ban of the app. Key lawmakers, including concerned Republicans, are bringing in Oracle this week to discuss the possible deal and rising national security concerns, according to four people familiar with the meetings. One of the three people familiar with the discussions with Oracle said the deal would essentially require the U.S. government to depend on Oracle to oversee the data of American users and ensure the Chinese government doesn't have a backdoor to it — a promise the person warned would be impossible to keep. 
"If the Oracle deal moves forward, you still have this [algorithm] controlled by the Chinese...." 

The data security company HaystackID, which serves as independent security inspectors for TikTok U.S., said in February that it has found no indications of internal or external malicious activity — nor has it identified any protected U.S. user data that has been shared with China.

And the book's publisher Macmillan released a defiant statement that "The arbitration order has no impact on Macmillan... We will absolutely continue to support and promote it." (They added that they were "appalled by Meta's tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement.") 
Saturday the controversy was even covered by Rolling Stone:

[Whistleblower Sarah] Wynn-Williams is a diplomat, policy expert, and international lawyer, with previous roles including serving as the Chief Negotiator for the United Nations on biosafety liability, according to her bio on the World Economic Forum... 
Since the book's announcement, Meta has forcefully responded to the book's allegations in a statement... "Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment. Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work. Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books." 
But the negative coverage continues, with the Observer Sunday highlighting it as their Book of the Week. "This account of working life at Mark Zuckerberg's tech giant organisation describes a 'diabolical cult' able to swing elections and profit at the expense of the world's vulnerable..." 
Though ironically Wynn-Williams started their career with optimism about Facebook's role in the app internet.org.
. "Upon witnessing how the nascent Facebook kept Kiwis connected in the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, she believed that Mark Zuckerberg's company could make a difference — but in a good way — to social bonds, and that she could be part of that utopian project... 
What internet.org involves for countries that adopt it is a Facebook-controlled monopoly of access to the internet, whereby to get online at all you have to log in to a Facebook account. When the scales fall from Wynn-Williams's eyes she realises there is nothing morally worthwhile in Zuckerberg's initiative, nothing empowering to the most deprived of global citizens, but rather his tool involves "delivering a crap version of the internet to two-thirds of the world". But Facebook's impact in the developing world proves worse than crap. In Myanmar, as Wynn-Williams recounts at the end of the book, Facebook facilitated the military junta to post hate speech, thereby fomenting sexual violence and attempted genocide of the country's Muslim minority. "Myanmar," she writes with a lapsed believer's rue, "would have been a better place if Facebook had not arrived." And what is true of Myanmar, you can't help but reflect, applies globally... 

"Myanmar is where Wynn-Williams thinks the 'carelessness' of Facebook is most egregious," writes the Sunday Times:

In 2018, UN human rights experts said Facebook had helped spread hate speech against Rohingya Muslims, about 25,000 of whom were slaughtered by the Burmese military and nationalists. Facebook is so ubiquitous in Myanmar, Wynn-Williams points out, that people think it is the entire internet. "It's no surprise that the worst outcome happened in the place that had the most extreme take-up of Facebook." Meta admits it was "too slow to act" on abuse in its Myanmar services.... 
After Wynn-Williams left Facebook, she worked on an international AI initiative, and says she wants the world to learn from the mistakes we made with social media, so that we fare better in the next technological revolution. "AI is being integrated into weapons," she explains. "We can't just blindly wander into this next era. You think social media has turned out with some issues? This is on another level."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fake &quot;Security Alert&quot; issues on GitHub use OAuth app to hijack accounts</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-security-alert-issues-on-github-use-oauth-app-to-hijack-accounts/</link><author>Lawrence Abrams</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:36:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A widespread phishing campaign has targeted nearly 12,000 GitHub repositories with fake "Security Alert" issues, tricking developers into authorizing a malicious OAuth app that grants attackers full control over their accounts and code.

"Give us back the Statue of Liberty," centre-left politician Raphaël Glucksmann said at a convention of his Place Publique center-left movement."We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: 'Give us back the Statue of Liberty,'" he told cheering supporters. "We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home," he added.The Statue of Liberty was unveiled in New York City's harbour on October 28, 1886, for the centennial of the American Declaration of Independence as a gift from the French people to America. It was designed by Frenchman Auguste Bartholdi. Paris does have a far smaller copy of the statue on a small island on the Seine in Paris.Glucksmann, a staunch defender of Ukraine, has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's radical change of US policy on the war. He also took aim at Trump's cuts to US research institutions, which have already prompted a French government initiative to attract some of them to work in France."The second thing we're going to say to the Americans is: 'If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovation, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world's leading power, then we're going to welcome them,'" continued Glucksmann.Since Trump returned to the White House in January, his government has cut federal research funding and sought to dismiss hundreds of federal workers working on health and climate research.Glucksmann also criticized far-right leaders in France, accusing them of being a "fan club" for Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who is spearheading the president's efforts to cut spending.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ecuadorians worry river oil spill will affect their health and crops | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lpjAFPx1Q</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/p3lpjAFPx1Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:13:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Residents fear an oil spill in Ecuador’s Viche River will affect their health and crops.

(Nvidia, AMD, and Intel...)
No company in the recent years — at least outside of China — was bold enough to engage into competition against these three contenders, so the very emergence of Bolt Graphics seems like a breakthrough. However, the major focuses of Bolt's Zeus are high-quality rendering for movie and scientific industries as well as high-performance supercomputer simulations. If Zeus delivers on its promises, it could establish itself as a serious alternative for scientific computing, path tracing, and offline rendering. But without strong software support, it risks struggling against dominant market leaders. 

This week the Sunnyvale, California-based startup introduced its Zeus GPU platform designed for gaming, rendering, and supercomputer simulations, according to the article. "The company says that its Zeus GPU not only supports features like upgradeable memory and built-in Ethernet interfaces, but it can also beat Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 by around 10 times in path tracing workloads, according to slide published by technology news site ServeTheHome."

 There is one catch: Zeus can only beat the RTX 5090 GPU in path tracing and FP64 compute workloads. It's not clear how well it will handle traditional rendering techniques, as that was less of a focus. In speaking with Bolt Graphics, the card does support rasterization, but there was less emphasis on that aspect of the GPU, and it may struggle to compete with the best graphics cards when it comes to gaming. And when it comes to data center options like Nvidia's Blackwell B200, it's an entirely different matter. 
Unlike GPUs from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia that rely on proprietary instruction set architectures, Bolt's Zeus relies on the open-source RISC-V ISA, according to the published slides. The Zeus core relies on an open-source out-of-order general-purpose RVA23 scalar core mated with FP64 ALUs and the RVV 1.0 (RISC-V Vector Extension Version 1.0) that can handle 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit data types as well as Bolt's additional proprietary extensions designed for acceleration of scientific workloads... Like many processors these days, Zeus relies on a multi-chiplet design... Unlike high-end GPUs that prioritize bandwidth, Bolt is evidently focusing on greater memory size to handle larger datasets for rendering and simulations. Also, built-in 400GbE and 800GbE ports to enable faster data transfer across networked GPUs indicates the data center focus of Zeus. 

High-quality rendering, real-time path tracing, and compute are key focus areas for Zeus. As a result, even the entry-level Zeus 1c26-32 offers significantly higher FP64 compute performance than Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 — up to 5 TFLOPS vs. 1.6 TFLOPS — and considerably higher path tracing performance: 77 Gigarays vs. 32 Gigarays. Zeus also features a larger on-chip cache than Nvidia's flagship — up to 128MB vs. 96MB — and lower power consumption of 120W vs. 575W, making it more efficient for simulations, path tracing, and offline rendering. However, the RTX 5090 dominates in AI workloads with its 105 FP16 TFLOPS and 1,637 INT8 TFLOPS compared to the 10 FP16 TFLOPS and 614 INT8 TFLOPS offered by a single-chiplet Zeus... 
The article emphasizes that Zeus "is only running in simulation right now... Bolt Graphics says that the first developer kits will be available in late 2025, with full production set for late 2026."

 In 2023 I tried out Codon. At the time I had difficulty compiling the scripts I most commonly used, but was excited by the prospect. Python is essentially single threaded and checks the shape (type) of each variable as it interprets scripts. Codon fixes types and compiles Python into compact, executable binaries that execute much faster. 

Several things have changed with their latest release: I have successful compiles, the committers have added a compiled version of NumPy (high performance math algorithms), and changed their open source license to Apache 2. 

"The other big news is that Exaloop, the company that is behind Codon, has changed their license to Apache 2..." according to the article, so "commercial use and derivations of Codon are now permitted without licensing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Capital is flowing from the U.S. to Europe</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jcnpwl/capital_is_flowing_from_the_us_to_europe/</link><author>/u/PjeterPannos</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:17:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0ew-1dZ3_8</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x0ew-1dZ3_8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:09:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

And that alert reminds us that Medusa is a globe-spanning operation that recruits third-party affiliates to plant ransomware and negotiate with victims, notes the Register. "Even organizations that have good ransomware recovery regimes, meaning they don't need to unscramble encrypted data as they have good backups and fall-back plans, may consider paying to prevent the release of their stolen data, given the unpleasant consequences that follow information leaks.

Medusa actors also set a deadline for victims to pay ransoms and provide a countdown timer that makes it plain when stolen info will be sprayed across the internet. If victims cough up $10,000 in cryptocurrency, the crims push the deadline forward by 24 hours. 

The advisory reveals one Medusa actor has taken things a step further. "FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid," the advisory states. That separate actor then "requested half of the payment be made again to provide the 'true decryptor'," the advisory states, describing this incident as "potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme." 

The security groups' advisory stresses that they "do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations..." (But "Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents...) 

Besides updating software and operating systems, the alert makes these recommendations for organizations:

Require VPNs (or jump hosts) for remote network access
Block remote access from unknown/untrusted origins, and disable unused ports
 Segment networks to help prevent the spread of ransomware
Use a networking monitoring tool to spot and investigate abnormal activity — including lateral movement (using endpoint detection and response tools). Log all network traffic, and monitor it for unauthorized scanning and access attempts.
Create recovery plans with encrypted offline backups of sensitive/proprietary data and servers
Require multifactor authentication, use strong (and long) passwords, and "consider not requiring frequently recurring password changes, as these can weaken security." (Also audit access control following the principle of least privilege, and watch for new and/or unrecognized accounts.)
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Malicious Adobe, DocuSign OAuth apps target Microsoft 365 accounts</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-adobe-docusign-oauth-apps-target-microsoft-365-accounts/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:19:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cybercriminals are promoting malicious Microsoft OAuth apps that masquerade as Adobe and DocuSign apps to deliver malware and steal Microsoft 365 accounts credentials.

Today, I want to examine another concerning trend in the blockchain space, i.e., the growing disconnect between Web3 rhetoric and Web2 reality in corporate structures.The blockchain ethos promised to transform not just technology, but organizational structures themselves. Yet, walk into most "Web3" companies today, and you'll find a strikingly familiar scene, i.e., traditional hierarchies, centralized decision-making, and the same corporate playbooks that have defined business for decades.\
These organizations proudly display their Web3 credentials, i.e., blockchain integrations, token offerings, and decentralized applications, while operating with thoroughly Web2 corporate DNA. The contradiction is stark, companies building tools for trustless, intermediary-free interactions are themselves structured around trust hierarchies and intermediary layers of management.Decision-Making: Decentralized in Name OnlyWhile many Web3 projects implement token-based governance systems, the reality often falls short of true decentralization. Major decisions frequently originate from a small group of founders or developers who maintain privileged access to critical infrastructure. Governance tokens create an illusion of community control, but power concentrations through token distribution models ensure the scales remain tipped in favor of insiders.\
Even more concerning is how easily these governance mechanisms can be manipulated. When convenient, decisions are put to token-holder votes, when not, they're made behind closed doors under the guise of "technical necessities" or "emergency responses."Perhaps nowhere is the contradiction more evident than in hiring practices. Companies building technologies meant to transform trust, verification, and social coordination continue to rely on outdated, inefficient hiring rituals straight from the Web2 playbook.\
My response to interview invitations has become standardized:"We are in Web3, but your hiring process is still in Web2. In Web3, we adhere to cryptographic guarantees of our LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositories. If you want to hire me, do it, but don't try to take me on a Web2 wild goose chase interview process, just to tell me I am not a good fit for role."\
The traditional hiring process designed around information asymmetry and artificial scarcity makes little sense in a Web3 context. My work is publicly verifiable. My contributions to open-source projects provide cryptographically secured proof of my capabilities. My on-chain reputation and digital footprint offer more meaningful insights than any contrived interview scenario could hope to extract.\
Yet, these companies insist on subjecting candidates to outdated assessment methods, endless interview rounds, and arbitrary technical challenges that bear little resemblance to actual work requirements. It's as if they're building spaceships while insisting on hiring astronauts using horse-and-buggy evaluation techniques.The true promise of Web3 extends far beyond tokenization and distributed ledgers. It offers a fundamental rethinking of organizational structure, incentive alignment, and coordination mechanisms. When companies adopt blockchain technology without embracing its organizational implications, they miss the most transformative aspects of the paradigm.\
Genuinely Web3 native organizations would look radically different i.e. flatter hierarchies, transparent decision-making, contribution-based meritocracies, and permissionless participation. Hiring would focus on verifiable skills and community reputation rather than credentialism and performative interviews.\
Some DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have begun experimenting with these new models, but even there, old habits die hard. Many DAOs still maintain core teams with outsized influence, effectively recreating traditional power dynamics with a thin veneer of decentralization.Moving Forward: Authenticity in the Decentralized EraThe blockchain space faces a critical identity crisis. Will it truly transform organizational structures or merely apply new technology to old centralized models? The answer will determine whether Web3 represents a genuine paradigm shift or simply the next iteration of corporate re-branding.\
For organizations serious about embracing Web3 principles, change must go beyond technology. It requires rethinking governance from first principles, embracing radical transparency, and letting go of centralized control mechanisms, including hiring processes.\
As for me, I remain committed to working only with organizations whose actions match their decentralized rhetoric. My verifiable work speaks for itself. My proposals for micro-governance models offer a blueprint for genuinely decentralized coordination.\
In a space built on the principle that "code is law," perhaps it's time we acknowledged that corporate structure is also code, i.e., social code that determines how we organize, incentivize, and collaborate. Until Web3 companies rewrite this code, they remain Web2 entities playing dress-up in blockchain clothing.\
The disruption in decentralization that Bitcoin started cannot be completed until we extend its principles beyond technology to transform the very nature of how we organize and work together.

While strikes on oil refineries and military targets were significant, one attack stood out—the hit on the Druzhba pipeline—creating international ripple effects beyond Russia’s borders as exports suddenly dropped.As you remember from a previous report, Ukrainians destroyed a significant number of Russian air defenses in Crimea, along the front line, and deep in the rear while also threatening to strike the Kerch Strait Bridge again. This forced Russia to relocate air defense systems to cover newly exposed weak spots. However, this played into Ukraine’s strategy, as the large-scale redeployments left several key targets vulnerable.This allowed Ukrainians to deploy hundreds of drones to penetrate Russia’s air defense grid, which was spread thin by the countless destroyed systems and subsequent relocations. As a result, Ukrainian drones reached as far as Moscow, with the first confirmed strike hitting the Oka-Center oil depot in the town of Serpukhov in Moscow Oblast, inflicting significant damage during the day.What followed was Russia’s most restless night yet. Russian reports state that over 337 Ukrainian drones struck Moscow, Kursk, Belgorod, Oryol, Lipetsk, Bryansk, and Ryazan in the largest drone strike to date. Strikes hit oil refineries in the Moscow area, including the city’s largest refinery, which supplies up to 50% of its diesel and gasoline consumption.Ukraine targets Russian oil: Druzhba pipeline and refineries disruptedExplosions near the Ryazan military airfield put all Russian airports on high alert, undermining the Russian Air Force’s rapid response capabilities. Additionally, a control station for the Druzhba pipeline in Oryol was hit, halting Russian oil exports to Central Europe, particularly Hungary.The Druzhba pipeline—one of the world’s largest, with a capacity of 2 million barrels per day—is a critical conduit for Russian oil exports to Central European refineries. Hungary imports most of its crude oil and gas via the Druzhba pipeline, with over 40% of Hungarian gas being Russian, making the strike on the control station particularly devastating for them. As a result, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, called it an attack on their sovereignty.When the oil and gas supply stopped, the halt of operations of the Druzhba pipeline meant that Hungary would have to import much more expensive oil and gas from allies like the USA and Norway. The cancellation of Russian oil and gas exports to Hungary could jeopardize Russia’s hold on the Hungarian energy sector, as the country would have to increase its overall reliance on Europe for its energy needs.Besides gas, the second-largest Hungarian energy source is nuclear power from its only nuclear power plant in Paks. This nuclear power plant depends on Russia’s nuclear fuel, uranium rods, and Russian engineers and expertise, consolidating Russia’s monopoly on the Hungarian energy sector. Through this, Russia maintains strict control over Hungary, as only Russian specialists and companies can currently maintain the reactors and supply critical equipment and fuel for their maintenance. Since nuclear power generates over a third of the country’s electricity, Hungary remains reliant on Russia to sustain its energy infrastructure.The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated that he had discussed the situation with the Deputy Russian Energy Minister, who assured him that pipeline control station repairs were underway and supplies would resume soon.Ukraine’s strategy: escalation or ceasefire leverage?If Russia does not accept a ceasefire—at least in the air—Ukraine can exert much more pressure on Russia’s energy hold on Hungary by launching follow-up strikes to destroy critical export infrastructure further and delay repairs.Overall, Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure are escalating. The latest attack hit Moscow’s main refinery, which supplies half the city’s energy needs. Additionally, damage to the Druzhba pipeline control station temporarily halted Russian energy exports to Hungary. Continued strikes could strain Russia’s economy and weaken its geopolitical influence, potentially pushing it toward negotiating a ceasefire—at least in the airspace over Russia and Ukraine., we pair up with the military blogger Reporting from Ukraine to keep you informed about what is happening on the battlefield in the Russo-Ukrainian war.You could close this page.

It's incredible how social engineering tactics can still be so effective. Cybersecurity costs are projected to reach $10.5 trillion annually this year, emphasizing the need for stronger defenses. The , recently published by Crowdstrike, emphasized that social engineering tactics aimed at stealing credentials grew an astounding 442% in the second half of 2024, with Generative AI driving new adversary risks.\
What keeps the Organizations and Security experts up at night? The explosive rise of AI-powered attacks and next-level social engineering. While AI has strengthened security, it has also armed cybercriminals with sophisticated, elusive attack methods. Malicious actors aren't just adopting AI; they are weaponizing it against organizations and Individuals. This is the new frontier of cybersecurity—an arms race in which we're not just battling hackers but also AI-powered machines that can think, adapt, and innovate faster than ever before.The State of Cybersecurity in the Face of Increasing AI ThreatsToday, AI is used to generate realistic deepfakes, phishing emails, and social engineering attacks that deceive users into divulging sensitive information. Since early 2023, SCATTERED SPIDER has used social engineering techniques to gain access to single sign-on (SSO) accounts and cloud-based application suites. Multiple eCrime actors adopted this technique in 2024. Several relevant cases targeted academic and healthcare entities; in these incidents, threat actors subsequently used the compromised identity to exfiltrate data from cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) applications or modify employee payroll data.\
Academic research and a  found that the phishing click rate (54%) for AI-generated phishing emails was significantly higher than for human-written phishing messages (12%)\
The message is simple - More awareness is needed among the users and access mechanisms should be tightened.How the Evolution of AI Affects Enterprise Cybersecurity Traditional money scams often fail—silicon masks can't perfectly mimic human skin and movement. But AI-powered video deepfakes are changing the game. In February 2024, CNN reported that a finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into transferring  to fraudsters. The scammers used generative AI to create a  of the company’s CFO, fooling the employee during a live video call and persuading them to authorize the payment. In 2019, A UK-based energy company  after fraudsters used AI-generated audio to mimic the voice of the CEO’s Germany-based parent company. The fraudsters called the UK company's CEO, pretending to be the CEO of the parent company, and demanded an urgent wire transfer.Voice phishing, often known as vishing, uses live audio to build on the power of traditional phishing, where people are persuaded to give information that compromises their organization. One example is Help Desk Social Engineering where employees may reveal sensitive information to criminals.We're facing a dangerous reality. Imagine this: just a few seconds of your voice is all it takes for AI attackers to create a convincing clone. It's happening right now—criminals crafting audio snippets that sound exactly like your loved ones, crying for help in manufactured crises, or demanding urgent financial aid. These digital doppelgängers are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing.Picture this: cybercriminals wield AI to create convincing phishing emails that you might actually fall for them. These digital con artists are raising their game—they've even masqueraded as OpenAI itself, sending businesses seemingly legitimate urgent requests for payment information updates.How Can Organizations Detect and Prevent AI-Powered Cybersecurity Attacks?Let's take a look at some of the key Defense Strategies:Deploy AI models trained to detect fake content and phishing attempts. Tools powered with AI can also be used to detect, identify, and respond to more sophisticated social engineering tactics.Implement stronger authenticationImplement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, companies can evaluate ways to enhance their authentication process, taking into account voice cloning and deepfake technology that can potentially bypass audio/video-based authentication systems. To deal with Help Desk social engineering techniques, require a video authentication with Identification Proof for employees requesting password reset.\
Did you know traditional MFA solutions can still fall prey to social engineering? That's precisely why phishing-resistant MFA is so crucial—it creates a shield that neither sophisticated AI nor crafty human adversaries can talk their way through when targeting your authentication.Educate employees on recognizing AI-generated scams. Companies may consider hosting training to educate employees on social engineering that leverages AI, teaching individuals how to proceed cautiously in the face of increasingly convincing threat actor communications.Cultivate a security-first culture:Organizations must embed security across all operations and workflows, treating it as a priority instead of an afterthought. Consider whether current policies and procedures have a system in place to review and respond to reports of advanced social engineering and whether new methods must be implemented to account for increasingly sophisticated tactics.Make no mistake: social engineering attacks target your greatest vulnerability—human psychology—and AI has dramatically intensified this threat by enabling attackers to decode human behavior at an unprecedented scale. How do we fight back? Organizations can't rely on a single solution—they must implement a robust multi-layered approach: cutting-edge AI security tools working alongside human-centered training and well-crafted procedures. This defense-in-depth strategy is crucial for survival in today's landscape.\

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document snippets to improve responses. With , you can build a fully local, offline RAG system—no cloud services, no dependencies, and complete data privacy. While  supports both large and small LLMs, it is especially optimized for smaller models without sacrificing flexibility for larger ones.Introduction to RAG and In RAG, a knowledge store is queried to retrieve pertinent documents added to the LLM prompt. This helps ground the model’s output with factual, up-to-date data. Traditional RAG setups require multiple components (document loaders, text splitters, vector databases, etc.), but  streamlines the entire process with a single CLI tool. Document ingestion and chunking.Embedding generation via local models (using Ollama).Storage in a hybrid vector store that supports both semantic and textual queries.Querying to retrieve context and generate answers.\
This local-first approach ensures privacy, speed, and ease of management.Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing RAG with Ensure you have Ollama installed. Then, run:curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dontizi/rlama/main/install.sh | sh
\
Verify the installation:Index your documents by creating a RAG store (hybrid vector store):rlama rag <model> <rag-name> <folder-path>
\
For example, using a model like :rlama rag deepseek-r1:8b mydocs ./docs
Scans your specified folder (recursively) for supported files.Converts documents to plain text and splits them into chunks (default: moderate size with overlap).Generates embeddings for each chunk using the specified model.Stores chunks and metadata in a local hybrid vector store (in ).  rlama add-docs mydocs ./new_docs --exclude-ext=.log
  rlama list-chunks mydocs --document=filename
  rlama update-model mydocs <new-model>
4. Configuring Chunking and Retrieval Chunks are pieces of text (e.g. ~300-500 tokens) that enable precise retrieval. Smaller chunks yield higher precision; larger ones preserve context. Overlapping (about 10-20% of chunk size) ensures continuity. The  flag controls how many chunks are retrieved per query (default is 20). For concise queries, 5-10 chunks might be sufficient, while broader questions might require 30 or more. Ensure the total token count (chunks + query) stays within your LLM’s limit. While  primarily uses dense vector search, it stores the original text to support textual queries. This means you get both semantic matching and the ability to reference specific text snippets.Launch an interactive session:rlama run mydocs --context-size=20
\
In the session, type your question:> How do I install the project?
Converts your question into an embedding.Retrieves the top matching chunks from the hybrid store.Uses the local LLM (via Ollama) to generate an answer using the retrieved context.You can exit the session by typing .Start the API server for programmatic access:curl -X POST http://localhost:11249/rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "rag_name": "mydocs",
        "prompt": "How do I install the project?",
        "context_size": 20
      }'
\
The API returns a JSON response with the generated answer and diagnostic details.Recent Enhancements and TestsImproved Document Management: Replaces the traditional vector store. Supports both vector embeddings and textual queries. Quickly finds relevant documents based on user input. Now each document chunk includes a  field for extra context, enhancing retrieval accuracy.Hybrid Store Integration: All documents are now fully indexed and retrievable, resolving previous limitations.I compared the new version with v0.1.25 using  with the prompt:\
  "list me all the routers in the code"(as simple and general as possible to verify accurate retrieval)Published Version on GitHub:Answer: The code contains at least one router, , which is responsible for course-related routes. Additional routers for authentication and other functionalities may also exist.(Source: src/routes/coursRouter.ts) There are four routers: , , , and .(Source: src/routes/sgaRouter.ts)Adjust  to balance speed and accuracy.Use smaller models for faster embedding, or a dedicated embedding model if needed.Exclude irrelevant files during indexing to keep the index lean.Fine-tune chunk size and overlap. Moderate sizes (300-500 tokens) with 10-20% overlap work well.Use the best-suited model for your data; switch models easily with .Experiment with prompt tweaks if the LLM occasionally produces off-topic answers.Ensure your hardware (RAM/CPU/GPU) is sufficient for the chosen model.Leverage SSDs for faster storage and multithreading for improved inference.For batch queries, use the persistent API mode rather than restarting CLI sessions. Focus on enhancing the chunking process to achieve an optimal RAG, even when using small models. Continue testing with different models and configurations to find the best balance for your data and hardware. Stay tuned for upcoming hybrid retrieval enhancements and adaptive chunking features. simplifies building local RAG systems with a focus on confidentiality, performance, and ease of use. Whether you’re using a small LLM for quick responses or a larger one for in-depth analysis,  offers a powerful, flexible solution. With its enhanced hybrid store, improved document metadata, and upgraded RagSystem, it’s now even better at retrieving and presenting accurate answers from your data. Happy indexing and querying!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rescuers search the rubble after a building collapse in Latakia, Syria, kills at least 16 people</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-lsCocmbJM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0-lsCocmbJM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 12:47:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ordnance from Syria's 13-year conflict exploded in the coastal city of Latakia, collapsing a building and killing more than a dozen people, the Syrian Civil Defense said Sunday.

Last year's rate of average global sea level rise was 0.23 inches per year, higher than the expected 0.17 inches per year, NASA said in a news release. 

The rate of global sea level rise follows a trend of rapidly increasing rates over the past 30 years. From 1993 to 2023, the rate of global sea level rise doubled, increasing from 0.08 inches per year to 0.18 inches, another NASA-led study showed. Overall, the global sea level has climbed by 4 inches since 1993. 

More details from ABC News:

 Climate change was a major driver to an unexpected level of sea level rise in 2024, according to a new NASA analysis... The majority of the difference between predicted and actual sea level rise was attributed to thermal expansion — or the ocean waters expanding as they warm, researchers said. An unusual amount of ocean warming, combined with meltwater from land-based ice such as glaciers, led to the increase of sea level rise last year, according to NASA. 

About two-thirds of sea level rise in recent years has resulted from the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, with a third coming from thermal expansion, according to NASA. In 2024, those metrics flipped, with two-thirds of the rise attributed to expanding ocean water and one-third attributed to contributions from melting ice. "With 2024 as the warmest year on record, Earth's expanding oceans are following suit, reaching their highest levels in three decades," said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, head of physical oceanography programs and the Integrated Earth System Observatory at NASA... Human-amplified climate change is the primary cause for present-day rising sea levels, climate research shows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>K-Pop group MISAMO members throw first pitch at Dodgers vs Tigers game in Tokyo</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55J7v3WV-4s</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/55J7v3WV-4s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 11:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[K-Pop group MISAMO added some glamour to the start of the Los Angeles' Dodgers second exhibition game in Tokyo.

That is one of the biggest challenges, because obviously everyone is worried about his or her own existence, and this government is very particular in going after people one by one, singling them out.”He added that state “propaganda” was spreading falsehoods about the opposition.“They constantly make up stories which are not true but which are able to lead people in a different direction, [they] mislead them by spreading lies about us,” he said.Magyar and his party are set to launch a popular survey on 12 key economic and political issues to give citizens a voice in the movement’s political platform in the run-up to next year’s vote.The 43-year-old MEP has also vowed to make Hungary part of a strong Europe, in contrast to Orbán’s Euroscepticism, which has seen him regularly clashing with politicians in Brussels and other European capitals.Speaking at a separate rally on Saturday, the 61-year-old Orbán said it was time to eliminate what he called a “shadow army” of NGOs, journalists, judges and politicians receiving payments from abroad.He has already announced plans to crack down on organizations funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) – which is now being dismantled by Trump – and Budapest-born billionaire George Soros, a supporter of liberal causes.This week Orbán’s Fidesz party submitted constitutional changes that would permit the expulsion of dual citizens deemed to pose a threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.While the Tisza movement may be riding high in recent polls, unseating Orbán would be a significant achievement. In the last parliamentary elections in 2022, a united front of anti-Fidesz candidates fell well short of Orbán’s party, which won over half of the popular vote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How AI is Learning to Read DNA and Sound</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-ai-is-learning-to-read-dna-and-sound?source=rss</link><author>Rendering Technology Breakthroughs</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 10:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ sequence length warmup for these pretraining experiments.

The highway will ease traffic into the city, which will host over 50,000 people at the conference this November:
The state government touts the highway's "sustainable" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact... Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side — a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Belém. 

Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area... The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife... 

The state government of Pará had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns. Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit. 
But on the bright side, Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, said the highway would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, as well as climate-friendly bike lanes and solar-powered lighting...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NASA’s stuck astronauts welcome their replacements to the space station</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBlKola5A40</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OBlKola5A40?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 06:30:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Just over a day after blasting off, a SpaceX crew capsule arrived at the International Space Station on Sunday, delivering the replacements for NASA’s two stuck astronauts.

Imagine a powerful-but-locally-hosted LLM that "doesn't spy... and no one else owns it."
 We download it, from souce-code if you like, install it, if we want. And it assists: us... No one gate-keeps it. It's not out to get us... 

And this is important: because no one owns it, the AI software is ours and leaks no data anywhere — to no one, no company, for no political nor financial purpose. No one profits — but you! 

Their longer original submission also asks a series of related questions — like why can't we have software without AI? (Along with "Why is AMD stamping AI on local-processors?" and "Should AI be crowned the ultimate hype?") But this question seems to be at the heart of their concern. "What future will anyone have if anything they really wanted to do — could be mimicked and sold by the ill-gotten work of others...?" 

"Could local, open-source, AI software be the only answer to dishearten billionaire companies from taking and selling back to their customers — everything we have done? Could we not...instead — steal their dream?!" 

Share your own thoughts and answers in the comments. Where are the open-source, local-only AI solutions?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 Launches Successfully</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke7mtPZKMHk</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ke7mtPZKMHk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 03:04:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NASA and SpaceX Crew-10 Mission to the International Space Station launched successfully.

A new video of Blue Ghost's moon-side view captures the eerie red light on the moon (caused by sunlight refracting through the atmosphere over the edges of the earth). "Blue Ghost turns red!" Firefly writes on their mission updates page. 

A SpaceX photographer also captured the eclipse as it happened over a Falcon 9 rocket waiting to launch to the International Space Station, in a remarkable time-lapse photograph.

Après une phase de tensions maximales, Américains et Ukrainiens ont renoué le dialogue cette semaine en proposant une trêve d'un mois, que la Russie n'a pas encore acceptée."C'est un moment de vérité parce que si la Russie ne s'engage pas sincèrement dans la paix", "le président Trump va durcir les sanctions et les représailles et donc on changera totalement de dynamique", a estimé Emmanuel Macron.Selon le chef de l'Etat français, "plusieurs pays européens, et d'ailleurs non européens, ont manifesté leur volonté de se joindre" à un éventuel envoi de troupes en Ukraine pour garantir un futur accord de paix avec la Russie. Il s'agirait de "quelques milliers d'hommes" par Etat, déployés "dans des points-clés, pour faire des programmes d'entraînement" et "montrer notre soutien dans la durée", a-t-il assuré. Jusqu'ici, Moscou s'oppose fermement à un tel déploiement."Les Ukrainiens ne peuvent en aucun cas faire des concessions territoriales et n'avoir aucune garantie de sécurité", a-t-il prévenu.S'agissant du renforcement massif de la défense acté par l'Union européenne la semaine dernière, il a expliqué avoir demandé aux industriels français de l'armement réunis vendredi à l'Elysée de "démarcher les Etats européens qui ont pris l'habitude d'acheter américain"."Ceux qui achètent (des missiles) Patriot, il faut leur proposer le SAM-T nouvelle génération franco-italien; ceux qui achètent du F35, il faut leur proposer du Rafale", a-t-il martelé. Il entend d'ailleurs "produire plus" de ces avions de chasse du groupe Dassault Aviation "plutôt que d'accélérer le programme d'avion du futur".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joby Aviation and Virgin Atlantic partner to launch electric air taxis in the UK</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/joby-aviation-and-virgin-atlantic-partner-to-launch-electric-air-taxis-in-the-uk/</link><author>Rebecca Bellan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joby Aviation is partnering with Virgin Atlantic to launch electric air taxis in the U.K., marking the seventh country in which the startup hopes to one day commercialize.

In the past these issues have been resolved quickly (within a week) and apologies issued with promises to do better. (See 2024-03-11, 2024-07-08, and 2025-01-30.) 

This time around it has been over six weeks and CloudFlare has been unable or unwilling to fix the problem on their end, effectively stalling any progress on the matter with various tactics including asking browser developers to sign overarching NDAs. 

That last link is an update posted today by Pale Moon's main developer:



Our current situation remains unchanged: CloudFlare is still blocking our access to websites through the challenges, and the captcha/turnstile continues to hang the browser until our watchdog terminates the hung script after which it reloads and hangs again after a short pause (but allowing users to close the tab in that pause, at least). To say that this upsets me is an understatement. Other than deliberate intent or absolute incompetence, I see no reason for this to endure. Neither of those options are very flattering for CloudFlare.

I wish I had better news.

 

In a comment, Slashdot reader BenFenner shares a list posted by Pale Moon's developer of reportedly affected browsers:

Slashdot reader Z00L00K speculates that "this is some kind of anti-bot measure that fails.

U situaciji kada su svi demonstranti bili mirni, kada se odavala petnaestominutna pošta nastradalima oružje je upotrebljeno. Jedini cilj tog čina je brutalan prikaz sile, dokaz arogancije, a motiv mržnja prema sopstvenom narodu“, navodi za portal N1 Radić.On kaže da „zvučni top“ od pre nekoliko godina poseduje bezbednosni sistem Srbije.Narodni poslanik Zdravko Ponoš, takođe, navodi i da je prema informacijama koje je on dobio u pitanju zvučno oružje.„Ta reakcija okupljenih, da imaju osećaj kao da je nešto prošlo pored njih je posledica upotrebe zvuka, a sa ciljem da se uplaše“, rekao je Ponoš.On je objasnio i da osim što se njime izazvala panika, ta vrsta oružja može da se koristi na više načina.„Upotreba tog oružja može naštetiti i zdravlju, a to što je upotrebljena u vreme dok je odavana pošta nastradalima je potpuni skandal“, naveo je Zdravko Ponoš.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>340 European Cities Restrict Usage of Cars</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/03/15/056253/340-european-cities-restrict-usage-of-cars?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:48:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cities in Europe "are dramatically scaling back their relationship with the car," reports the Washington Post:

 They are removing parking spaces and creating dedicated bike lanes. They are installing cameras at the perimeter of urban centers and either charging the most-polluting vehicles or preventing them from entering. Some are going so far as to put entire neighborhoods off-limits to vehicles. In Norway, Oslo promotes "car-free livability." Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo touts the "end of car dependence." And while those ideas might sound radical to car-loving Americans, they are fast becoming the norm across the Atlantic, where 340 European cities and towns — home to more than 150 million people — have implemented some kind of restrictions on personal car usage... 

[V]irtually every major European city is imposing some kind of rule. Milan has a system similar to New York's, charging for access to the city core — while entirely banning older, highly polluting vehicles. London charges vehicles that don't meet emissions standards, in what it calls the "largest clean-air zone in the world." The programs are not just the purview of liberal Western Europe: Warsaw, Poland, and Sofia, Bulgaria, recently adopted similar schemes. Even little Italian villages have added vehicle restrictions to reinforce their historic feel. And the Netherlands just broke ground on a 12,000-person neighborhood that will be entirely car-free. The neighborhood, known as Merwede, will be connected by public transport to Utrecht, a medium-size city that — perhaps no surprise — has a low-emissions zone of its own... 

 Perhaps the most elaborate and transformative effort has come in Paris, where Anne Hidalgo was elected mayor in 2014. Since then, Paris has banned the most-polluting vehicles from the city, eliminated 50,000 parking spaces and added hundreds of miles of bike lanes. It turned a bank of the Seine from a busy artery into a pedestrian zone, and closed off the famed Rue de Rivoli to traffic... Journeys by car in Paris have dropped by about 45 percent since 1990. The city has now become a source for striking before-and-after photos: of clogged streets that have transitioned into tree-lined areas where people can walk and play. 
In London government officials say inhalable particular matter has fallen, according to the article, while combustion-produced nitrogen dioxide "is 53% lower than it would have been without the restrictions."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar: An alternative to Viktor Orban? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtkYFfWxkIE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vtkYFfWxkIE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:44:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hungary's opposition hold large rallies on Hungary's Independence Day.

In April, Ukraine sortied one of its then-new Aeroprakt A-22 sport plane drones to strike a drone plant in Yelabuga, 550 miles east of Moscow.The 2024 raid remains one of the deepest in Ukraine’s escalating campaign of deep strikes on Russian targets, And it may have been the first in which the Ukrainian drones went after the industry supporting Russia’s own drones.It makes sense for the Ukrainians to continue striking Russian drone factories. Ukraine’s edge in drone warfare is perhaps its most important advantage as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 37th month.Ukrainian drones are so thick in the sky in many of the most important sectors that any Russian vehicles that leave their dugouts “operate in a one-way manner,” one Russian blogger complained.Struggling to jam the well-made Ukrainian drones, the Russians are trying to at least match the explosive UAVs vehicle-for-vehicle—if not exceed them on a technological level.Elite Russian drone groups were the first in Ukraine to deploy unjammable fiber-optic drones that send and receive signals via miles-long cables instead of via radio datalinks, which are vulnerable to Ukrainian electronic warfare.And now the Kremlin is ramping up production of the most numerous first-person-view drones in order to keep pace with Ukrainian production. The Kremlin has announced it will acquire as many as 4 million FPV drones this year; the defense ministry in Kyiv is hoping to acquire 4.5 million. The gap is closing.In blowing up the drone factories, ironically with drones, the Ukrainian intelligence agency hopes to throttle Russian production—and ensure that most of the tiny UAVs buzzing over the front line ... are Ukrainian.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fighter jets take off from aircraft carrier as Trump orders strikes on Yemen&apos;s capital</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHJmN4Wdl4U</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uHJmN4Wdl4U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 21:12:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Because here's the thing. The $10 billion James Webb Space telescope (in operation since 2022) "has found that the vast majority of deep space and, thus the early galaxies it has so far observed, are rotating in the same direction. While around two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise, the other third rotates counter-clockwise."

In a random universe, scientists would expect to find 50% of galaxies rotating one way, while the other 50% rotate the other way. This new research suggests there is a preferred direction for galactic rotation... "It is still not clear what causes this to happen, but there are two primary possible explanations," team leader Lior Shamir, associate professor of computer science at the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering, said in a statement. "One explanation is that the universe was born rotating. 

"That explanation agrees with theories such as black hole cosmology, which postulates that the entire universe is the interior of a black hole. 

"But if the universe was indeed born rotating, it means that the existing theories about the cosmos are incomplete." Black hole cosmology, also known as "Schwarzschild cosmology," suggests that our observable universe might be the interior of a black hole itself within a larger parent universe. The idea was first introduced by theoretical physicist Raj Kumar Pathria and by mathematician I. J. Good. It presents the idea that the "Schwarzchild radius," better known as the "event horizon," (the boundary from within which nothing can escape a black hole, not even light) is also the horizon of the visible universe. 
The article cites a theory by Polish theoretical physicist Nikodem Poplawski of the University of New Haven that ultimately black holes don't compress indefinitely into a singularity. "The matter instead reaches a state of finite, extremely large density, stops collapsing, undergoes a bounce like a compressed spring, and starts rapidly expanding," Poplawski explained to Space.com...
The scientist continued by adding that rapid recoil after such a big bounce could be what has led to our expanding universe, an event we now refer to as the Big Bang... "I think that the simplest explanation of the rotating universe is the universe was born in a rotating black hole." 
Team leader Shamir offers another theory: that we just need to re-calibrate our distance measurements for the deep universe. (Which could also explain the difference in the expansion rates in the universe "and the large galaxies that according to the existing distance measurements are expected to be older than the universe itself.")]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s tariffs leave US bourbon distillers in limbo | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flwmep6zVgU</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/flwmep6zVgU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Victor Yarbrough, who is a small bourbon producer in Kentucky had been in talks to expand sales in Canada but with the Trump administration’s tariff war, ‘the whole Canadian growth strategy is now on pause,’ he said.

[Waymo is responsible for 0.05% of the city's fines, according to statistics from the article.] 

Parking violations are one of the few ways to quantify how often self-driving companies' vehicles break the rules of the road... Some parking violations, such as overstaying in a paid spot, cause inconvenience but do not directly endanger other people. Others increase the risk of crashes, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. Anytime a vehicle is obstructing the flow of traffic, other drivers might be forced to brake suddenly or change lanes, he said, creating risks for drivers, pedestrians or other road users... 

San Francisco transit operators lost 2 hours and 12 minutes of service time in 2024 because of Waymo vehicles blocking or colliding with transit vehicles, according to San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency records. Autonomous vehicles have obstructed firefighters responding to emergency scenes in San Francisco, triggering city officials to ask for tougher oversight from state regulators. 

The article adds that driverless Waymo vehicles in Los Angeles received 75 more tickets in 2024 — "with $543 in fines still outstanding, according to records from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Orban accuses the EU of abusing its power in fiery speech commemorating Hungary’s Independence Day</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw0qj8gXSWk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mw0qj8gXSWk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 18:18:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, Viktor Orban held a speech at an Independence Day rally commemorating Hungary's revolution against the Austrian Empire on March 15th, 1848. Orban accused the EU of "abusing" its authority over Hungary, comparing it to how the Austrian Empire once controlled Hungary under its reign. He also labelled journalists and foreign-funded NGOs "bugs". Hungary is a member of the European Union, yet is at odds with some of the EU's stated policy positions.

In 2012 Mann sued two bloggers for defamation — and last year Mann finally won more than $1 million, reports the Washington Post. "A jury found that two conservative commentators had defamed him by alleging that he was like a child molester in the way he had 'molested and tortured' climate data." 

But "Now, a year after that ruling, the case has taken a turn that leaves Mann in the position of the one who owes money."

 On Wednesday, a judge sanctioned Mann's legal team for "bad-faith trial misconduct" for overstating how much the scientist lost in potential grant funding as a result of reputational harm. The lawyers had shown jurors a chart that listed one grant amount Mann didn't get at $9.7 million, though in other testimony Mann said it was worth $112,000. And when comparing Mann's grant income before and after the negative commentary, the lawyers cited a disparity of $2.8 million, but an amended calculation pegged it at $2.37 million. 

The climate scientist's legal team said it was preparing to fight the setbacks in court. Peter J. Fontaine, one of Mann's attorneys, wrote in an email that Mann "believes that the court committed errors of fact and law and will pursue these matters further." Fontaine emphasized that the original decision — that Mann was defamed by the commentary — still stands. "We have reviewed the recent rulings by the D.C. Superior Court and are pleased to note that the court has upheld the jury's verdict," he said.

Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada’s plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets.The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each.A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada given the “changing environment,” or if there are better options.“At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft,” Laurent de Casanove said in a statement to CityNews. “The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs.”“To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract.” Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada. The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force’s aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032. In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, “particularly where there may be opportunities” to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada.“The direction I’ve been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada,” he said.Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners “to see what is possible.”A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments. “Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future,” the company said in a statement.The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon.On-again, off-again decision to buy F-35sThe Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition in 2010, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider.Then, in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35 at all.The government planned to buy 18 Super Hornets without a competition as an “interim” measure but cancelled the plan after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier.Ottawa initiated an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019.In January 2023, Canada announced it would buy the F-35 fighter jet with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032.At the time, Defence Minister Anita Anand called the F-35 the best choice for Canada.A mixed fleet of planes ‘less disruptive, but costly and complex’Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued that Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them.He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should “cut its losses.”“We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems,” he said.Philippe Lagassé, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a “large scale transition underway” from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn’t only include the planes, but also the also the “infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America.”Lagassé, who also served as a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking.“It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time,” he said.Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane “would be less disruptive, but costly and complex.”The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion. A 2023 report estimated the acquisition phase would cost $19.8 billion, including $10.7 billion for 88 planes, $2.1 billion for weapons and ammunition and $5.9 billion for elements like design and depot costs, infrastructure and training.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cubans left in the dark after electrical grid fails | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_90BNmejGo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W_90BNmejGo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 17:20:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cuba's national electrical grid collapsed late on Friday, leading to blackouts across the country.

Video filmed by CNN in the capital Havana showed streets and buildings shrouded in total darkness, as people used electric torches to navigate the streets. By Saturday morning, the Cuban government officials said that "microsystems" — pockets of electricity — had been restored in some cities. However, it remains unclear when the island's power system would be fully online again and most people remained in the dark... 

It marks the latest in a series of failures on the Caribbean island struggling with creaking infrastructure, natural disasters and economic turmoil... For nearly a week in October, most of Cuba suffered near-total blackouts, the worst energy outages in decades. While Cubans are used to frequent power outages, to have another nationwide backcourt — the fourth in six months — was unsettling for many people who need electricity to cook and refrigerate food that otherwise spoils quickly in the tropical heat.

InfoWorld writes that "The initiative promises dramatic improvements in editor startup speed, build times, and memory usage, making it easier to scale TypeScript to large code bases, Microsoft said."

Microsoft's TypeScript team expects to be able to preview command-line type-checking in Go-based tsc by mid-2025, and to deliver a feature-complete Go implementation of TypeScript by the end of the year. [You can build and run the Go code now from Microsoft's new working repository.]
 Developers who use Go-based TypeScript in the Visual Studio Code editor will feel the increased speed in the editor, Microsoft said. The company promises an 8x improvement in project load times, instant comprehensive error listings across entire projects, and greater responsiveness for all language service operations including completion lists, quick information, go to definition, and find all references. The new TypeScript will also support more advanced refactoring and deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute, the company said. 

Microsoft believes native Go implementations reduce build times by up to 10x, notes Neowin. But "Developers can expect TypeScript 6.0 to have some deprecations and breaking changes to support the upcoming Go-based version."

Later this year, Microsoft will be releasing this new native Go implementation as TypeScript 7.0. The current JS-based TypeScript codebase will continue development into the 6.x series until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption, since some projects may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other things that are not supported by TypeScript 7+. 
TypeScript's original creator Anders Hejlsberg recorded an announcement video — and also shared his thoughts in a GitHub discussion titled simply... "Why Go?"
The TypeScript compiler's move to Go was influenced by specific technical requirements, such as the need for structural compatibility with the existing JavaScript-based codebase, ease of memory management, and the ability to handle complex graph processing efficiently. After evaluating numerous languages and making multiple prototypes — including in C# — Go emerged as the optimal choice... 
Let's be real. Microsoft using Go to write a compiler for TypeScript wouldn't have been possible or conceivable in years past. However, over the last few decades, we've seen Microsoft's strong and ongoing commitment to open-source software, prioritizing developer productivity and community collaboration above all. Our goal is to empower developers with the best tools available, unencumbered by internal politics or narrow constraints. This freedom to choose the right tool for each specific job ultimately benefits the entire developer community, driving innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes. And you can't argue with a 10x outcome! 

Hejlsberg also addressed their choice of Go in an online interview with the Michigan TypeScript meetup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpaceX launches astronauts for long-awaited International Space Station crew swap</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/15/spacex-launches-astronauts-for-long-awaited-international-space-station-crew-swap/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:13:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[SpaceX successfully launched four people into space on Friday, beginning a mission that will give the International Space Station enough crew members to allow astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to return to Earth after their nine-month stay.

"The two renewable energy sources accounted for 17% of the country's power mix while coal fell to a low of 15%, it said."

Solar was the fastest-growing energy source, according to Ember's analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, increasing 27% from the year before, while wind rose 7%... Natural gas generation increased 3.3% in 2024, according to Ember, and remains by far the largest source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for 43% of the mix... 
California and Nevada both surpassed 30% annual share of solar in their electricity mix for the first time last year (32% and 30%, respectively). California's battery growth was key to its solar success. It installed 20% more battery capacity than it did solar capacity, which helped it transfer a significant share of its daytime solar to the evening. Texas installed more solar and battery capacity than even California. 

Yet the growth of solar was uneven — 28 states generated less than 5% of their electricity from solar in 2024, highlighting significant untapped potential — even before adding battery storage. 
The article includes this observation from Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember. "The fall in battery costs is a gamechanger for how much solar the U.S. electricity grid could integrate in the near future." 

Electrek notes that "After being stagnant for 14 years, electricity demand started rising in recent years and saw a 3% increase in 2024, marking the fifth-highest level of rise this century..."

Natural gas grew three times more than the decline in coal, increasing power sector CO2 emissions slightly (0.7%). Coal fell by the second smallest amount since 2014, as gas and clean energy growth met rising electricity demand, whereas historically, they have replaced coal. Despite growing emissions, the carbon intensity of electricity continued to decline. The rise in power demand was much faster than the rise in power sector CO2 emissions, making each unit of electricity likely the cleanest it has ever been.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Akira ransomware decryptor cracks encryptions keys using GPUs</title><link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/gpu-powered-akira-ransomware-decryptor-released-on-github/</link><author>Bill Toulas</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 14:16:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/">BleepingComputer</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Security researcher Yohanes Nugroho has released a decryptor for the Linux variant of Akira ransomware, which utilizes GPU power to retrieve the decryption key and unlock files for free.

Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

In this scam, dubbed “,” the visitor to a hacked or malicious website is asked to distinguish themselves from bots by pressing a combination of keyboard keys that causes  to download password-stealing malware.ClickFix attacks mimic the “Verify You are a Human” tests that many websites use to separate real visitors from content-scraping bots. This particular scam usually starts with a website popup that looks something like this:This malware attack pretends to be a CAPTCHA intended to separate humans from bots.Clicking the “I’m not a robot” button generates a pop-up message asking the user to take three sequential steps to prove their humanity.Executing this series of keypresses prompts Windows to download password-stealing malware.Step 1 involves simultaneously pressing the keyboard key with the Windows icon and the letter “R,” which opens a Windows “Run” prompt that will execute any specified program that is already installed on the system.Step 2 asks the user to press the “CTRL” key and the letter “V” at the same time, which pastes malicious code from the site’s virtual clipboard.Step 3 — pressing the “Enter” key — causes Windows to download and launch malicious code through “,” a Windows program designed to run Microsoft HTML application files.“This campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT,”  wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.”According to Microsoft, hospitality workers are being tricked into downloading credential-stealing malware by cybercriminals impersonating . The company said attackers have been sending malicious emails impersonating Booking.com, often referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, or online promotion opportunities — all in a bid to convince people to step through one of these ClickFix attacks.In November 2024, KrebsOnSecurity reported that hundreds of hotels that use booking.com had been subject to targeted phishing attacks. Some of those lures worked, and allowed thieves to gain control over booking.com accounts. From there, they sent out phishing messages asking for financial information from people who’d just booked travel through the company’s app.Earlier this month, the security firm warned about ClickFix attacks targeting people working in the healthcare sector. The company said those attacks leveraged malicious code stitched into the widely used physical therapy video site HEP2go that redirected visitors to a ClickFix prompt.An alert (PDF) released in October 2024 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services warned that the ClickFix attack can take many forms, including fake  error pages and popups that spoof .ClickFix tactic used by malicious websites impersonating Google Chrome, Facebook, PDFSimpli, and reCAPTCHA. Source: Sekoia.The ClickFix attack — and its reliance on mshta.exe — is reminiscent of phishing techniques employed for years that hid exploits inside . Malicious macros became such a common malware threat that Microsoft was forced to start blocking macros by default in Office documents that try to download content from the web.Alas, the email security vendor  has documented plenty of ClickFix attacks via phishing emails that include HTML attachments spoofing Microsoft Office files. When opened, the attachment displays an image of Microsoft Word document with a pop-up error message directing users to click the “Solution” or “How to Fix” button.HTML files containing ClickFix instructions. Examples for attachments named “Report_” (on the left) and “scan_doc_” (on the right). Image: Proofpoint.Organizations that wish to do so can take advantage of Microsoft Group Policy restrictions to prevent Windows from executing the “run” command when users hit the Windows key and the “R” key simultaneously.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Republican Congressman Jim Jordan asks Big Tech if Biden tried to censor AI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/republican-congressman-jim-jordan-asks-big-tech-if-biden-tried-to-censor-ai/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:12:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent letters to 16 American technology firms, including Google and OpenAI, asking for past communications with the Biden administration that might suggest the former president “coerced or colluded” with companies to “censor lawful speech” in AI products.

The researchers were initially astonished by how effectively some of their interpretability methods seemed to uncover these hidden training objectives, although the methods are still under research.While the research involved models trained specifically to conceal information from automated software evaluators called reward models (RMs), the broader purpose of studying hidden objectives is to prevent future scenarios where AI systems might deceive or manipulate human users.While training a language model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reward models are typically tuned to score AI responses according to how well they align with human preferences. However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google is replacing Google Assistant with Gemini</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/google-is-replacing-google-assistant-with-gemini/</link><author>Aisha Malik</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:49:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google will replace Google Assistant on Android phones with Gemini later this year, the company announced on Friday.

Why is an ‘open’ future controversial among theologians? If the future is not ‘settled’, if there is no certainty from God’s viewpoint of how future events will turn out, then God’s providence, could not be as sure. If the future is truly open, then not even God could know the future because there are no future facts to know.

Agnostics do not know whether or not God exists. Theists surmise they’re reprobates. Atheists suppose they’re cowards. Are there different kinds of agnostics? Can agnosticism deepen appreciation for God—what it would take to believe in God and what it would mean if indeed there were a God? A robust, energetic agnosticism is a credit to God if there is one.

           By March 4, 2025Mozilla's actions have been rubbing many Firefox fans the
wrong way as of late, and inspiring them to look for alternatives.
There are many choices for users who are looking for a browser that
isn't part of the Chrome monoculture but is full-featured and suitable
for day-to-day use. For those who are willing to stay in the Firefox
"family" there are a number of good options that have taken vastly
different approaches. This includes GNU IceCat, Floorp, LibreWolf, and Zen.Mozilla has been disappointing a lot of Firefox users for years,
but it seems the pace is accelerating. Its announcement on
February 19 that it needs to "diversify" beyond Firefox did not
inspire confidence, and it annoyed many who would like to see Mozilla
go all-in on its flagship browser (and increase its market share)
rather than chasing AI or dabbling in advertising. But a recent and
more alarming example is its introduction of terms of use for the
browser and the removal of its pledge not to sell users' personal
data. Though it has backpedaled
somewhat since, and rewritten its terms of use, the damage has been
done.
Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it
flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come.
The GNU project also adopted the name IceWeasel for the GNUzilla
project—basically Mozilla source code with any non-free
code, such as the Adobe Flash
Player, stripped out. In 2007, Karl Berry announced
that GNUzilla would be adopting the name IceCat for its version
"not because we have anything against weasels" but to avoid
confusion with Debian's version.IceCat has the distinction of being the oldest Firefox fork still
in development. Ray Dryden applied
for GNUzilla to become part of the GNU Project in August 2005,
and test releases based on Firefox 1.5.0 were available later
that year. IceCat, as with all of the forks covered in this article,
is available under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0. However, the
scripts and other tools used to create an IceCat release from Firefox
are licensed under the GPLv3.GNUzilla does not distribute binaries of IceCat. The project
recommends using GNU Guix to
install IceCat on x86_64 Linux systems, and also makes its scripts
available in its Git repository to
compile IceCat from Firefox's extended-support releases (ESRs). It
may, however, also be packaged for a user's favorite Linux
distribution. Fedora 41, for example, currently has
IceCat 115.20.0esr—which is based on Firefox 115.20.0;
both were released on February 4.Current-day IceCat has several changes that distinguish it from
Firefox. The most immediately obvious is its use of the LibreJS add-on to
block "nonfree nontrivial JavaScript while allowing JavaScript that
is free and/or trivial". In practice, this means that a significant 
number of sites will not work unless the user adds exceptions for
the JavaScript used by the site. Users can choose to add exceptions for
individual scripts blocked by LibreJS or to add an exception for the
entire site. Even LWN, which uses a minimal amount of JavaScript,
has scripts that are blocked by LibreJS.IceCat includes the JShelter
extension, which attempts to block not just malware, but browser fingerprinting
and user tracking as well. It modifies the JavaScript environment that
is available to web pages to try to confuse fingerprinters and make it
more difficult to carry out attacks using JavaScript. It may block
APIs or return fake values to thwart these attempts. Like LibreJS, it
can be modified or turned off
entirely for specific sites. There is a paper from 2022 that
explains the extension's approach in great detail, and an extensive FAQ that may be of use
in troubleshooting interactions between JShelter and web sites.In a similar vein, IceCat includes a fork of
the Third-party
Request Blocker extension that (as the name implies) blocks
connections to third-party resources without user consent. It is a
little concerning that the page
describing the extension describes it as "seemingly maintained by
'sw'", and its last update was in March 2020. The home page
listed for the extension is no longer available. Despite the lag in
development, it still seems to be working and blocking plenty of
third-party requests. A visit to a site like The Guardian, for instance, shows
seven sites blocked. As the screenshot shows, site layout and images
are often affected by IceCat's default settings. Usually the sites are
still usable, but far less aesthetically pleasing.One thing that worked well for me was to enable just enough
to see the page text and then use the reader view to read a site's
articles or other content. (Sadly, none of the forks offer a "browse
everything in reader view by default" option.)In all, IceCat ships with eight extensions that either attempt to
enhance user privacy, block non-free software, or unbreak sites that
are affected by its other extensions. It includes a "LibreJS/USPS
compatibility" plugin to offer an alternative shipping calculator for
the US Postal Service site as well as
an extension to replace JavaScript blocked by LibreJS on the Library
Genesis sites.The project has an extension-finder service called Mozzarella, which (of course)
only lists extensions that are free software. However, the extensions
may be outdated compared to their counterparts listed in Firefox's
add-on catalog. For example, the Privacy Badger extension in the Mozzarella
catalog was last updated in June 2023. The Firefox
catalog version was last updated on January 29, 2025.Right now, three people are listed as maintainers for GNUzilla:
Ruben Rodriguez, Amin Bandali, and Mark H. Weaver. The development
mailing lists are a bit on the quiet side. The last-archived
conversation currently for the gnuzilla-dev list is from
August 2024. The bug-gnuzilla
list is a little more lively—its last activity was in
December 2024.IceCat is probably a good choice for folks who are more concerned
with the free software ethos and privacy than with
functionality.The Floorp project is a much
newer entrant. It is developed by a community
of Japanese students called Ablaze. Development is hosted on GitHub,
and the project solicits donations
via GitHub donations. According to its donations page, donors who
contribute at the $100 level may submit ads to feature in the new tab
page—but the ads, which are displayed as shortcuts with a
"sponsored" label, can be turned off in the settings. I've been unable
to find any information about the project governance or legal
structure of Ablaze.Its contributors
page lists seven primary maintainers and 39 code contributors, as well as
many people who have contributed to its language packs and
translations, or who maintain packages. Floorp does not offer native
packages for Linux distributions, but it does provide a Flatpak via
Flathub and precompiled
releases for x86_64 and ARM64.Originally Floorp was based on Chromium but switched to Firefox in
early 2022. The first Firefox-derived version was Floorp v7 (announcement in
Japanese), and it was based on the Firefox rapid releases, but the
project switched to the ESR releases as their base with v8. The most
recent release, version 11.23.1, was announced on
February 15, and is based on (according to
) the Firefox ESR 128.8.0 release,
which came out on March 4. It would
be nice if the project were more explicit in its release notes about which
version of Firefox a release was based on. This is not merely for
curiosity's sake—it would help users track whether Floorp was
receiving the most recent security updates. The project has said that
it plans to
move back to the rapid release versions of Firefox with v12, which is
currently in beta.The project promises "strong tracking protection" and that
it does not track users or have any affiliation with advertising
companies. However, the project does not give details on how its
tracking protection differs from Firefox's. It still uses Google as
its default search engine and includes the Firefox
browser sync feature. It also uses Mozilla's add-ons repository,
and should work with most Firefox add-ons
that are compatible with the corresponding Firefox version.Floorp does have a number of interesting features and enhancements
that may tempt users. It has a dual-sidebar layout that allows users
to access bookmarks, history, and other tools on the left-hand side,
while the right-hand has the Web Apps panel. Users can add web sites
to open in the Web Apps panel, which can be useful while (for example)
doing research for an article while keeping a version of the article
open in the panel.In addition to the Apps panel, Floorp has a split-view feature that
lets users open two pages side-by-side by selecting a tab and clicking
"Split this Tab". Each split has its own history and URL bar. Floorp's
layout is great for wide-screen monitors, and I like the ability to
open sites in split view rather than juggling multiple browser
windows.Another interesting inclusion in Floorp is its Workspace
feature. This allows users to group tabs by categories like
"work", "comics", "shopping", or whatever makes sense for the users'
browsing habits. I've found this useful for working on projects and
stories for LWN—I might have a dozen tabs open for a specific
story, which I can group into a single workspace. Workspaces can also
be assigned to Firefox's multi-account
containers. For example, a user might want to log in to the same
site using different accounts—without having to sign in and out
repeatedly. Combining the workspace and multi-account containers can
be useful in a number of scenarios.Firefox's tabs have seen little feature advancement in the past few
years. Floorp adds a few much-needed enhancements here, allowing users
to move the tab bar to the bottom of the window, use a multi-row tab
bar, and even a vertical tab bar. However, the Floorp implementation
of the vertical tab bar will go away in v12, now that Mozilla has
finally
added vertical tabs in Firefox 136.0.Overall, Floorp is an interesting project with some nice
enhancements to the Firefox UI. However, the development roadmap seems
a bit more haphazard than I would like—switching back and forth
between Firefox rapid release and ESRs, for example. That may not
dissuade other folks, though.The LibreWolf project got its start in 2020. Its focus is primarily
around privacy, security, and the removal of ""
features, such as telemetry and DRM, from Firefox. It lists seven core
contributors on its home page and points to its Matrix room for
development discussions. Its development is hosted on Codeberg.LibreWolf has the normal configuration options one would expect for
a Firefox fork, but it also has the option of using a special
configuration file called  to set
preferences that can take effect across multiple profiles rather than
having to tweak the configuration for each profile. It also makes
preferences easy to back up and move to a new machine. The documentation explains
where to find this file, depending on the installation method, and offers
several suggestions for possible preference changes.LibreWolf is mostly notable for what it  have
rather than what it does. That is, it removes other features from
Firefox that have not been well-received by many users such as Pocket
integration, telemetry, and more. Firefox Sync is disabled by default
but it can be enabled in settings.LibreWolf does include the uBlock Origin add-blocker add-on
as part of its standard installation. It should be noted that uBlock
Origin is being disabled
for Chrome users as Google phases
out support for the WebExtension
API V2 in favor of V3, which will curtail features that uBlock
Origin and other add-ons require to function. To its credit, Mozilla
has committed
to continuing its support for Manifest V2 and V3. LWN covered Manifest V3 and
its impact on content blockers in 2021.For the most part, users would be hard-pressed to spot many
differences between LibreWolf and Firefox at first (or second) glance,
so a screen shot of LibreWolf seemed a bit unnecessary. That approach
is likely to appeal to many users who are uneasy with things like
telemetry and Pocket, but don't want an entirely new browsing
experience.The Zen browser project is the most recent entrant. Its development
began last year with an
announcement on Reddit. It is currently in beta, with its most
recent version, 1.8.2b
based on Firefox 135.0.1, released on
February 25. Kudos to the Zen project, by the way, for
proudly including the Firefox version alongside the project version in
its "About" dialog—information that literally every other
Firefox fork seems intent on hiding. Zen lists 12 people in the main
project team, and about 90 contributors to the
browser. Development for Zen is hosted on GitHub,
and discussion takes place on Discord (link goes
to a Discord invitation).Like Floorp, the project solicits donations to
assist with development, but little information seems to be available
about its governance or structure to provide transparency about how
the money is spent.Unlike the other forks, it is not immediately obvious that Zen is
an offshoot of Firefox. It does not look at all like the standard
Firefox interface, even before users start customizing it. Even
Floorp, which allows significant customization, still bears some
resemblance to Firefox on first use. Zen sports a tab sidebar on the
left that blends the Workspace concept from Floorp and vertical tabs,
with a set of default bookmarks ("Essentials") as icons at the
top. The browser menu is located in the top-left corner, indicated by
a button with three dots. The window title bar is hidden and only
appears if a user hovers the mouse at the top of the window for a few
seconds.While Zen looks modern and interesting, its sleek user interface
and configurability comes at the cost of intuitive usability in some
cases. For example, one might expect that setting Zen to light mode in
the "Language and Appearance" settings would also change the browser's
interface to light mode. It does not, as shown in the
screenshot. Instead, a user has to go to the "Add-ons and Themes"
settings to select a light theme. It would help a great deal if Zen's
user guide
were more complete, but it only has a little bit of documentation to
offer at the moment. To be fair, it is still a beta project, so it may
be much improved by the time the Zen browser has its first stable
release. For now, users will need to be ready to dig through Reddit
and other forums for tips.Features like glance, which pre-fetches a link and gives a preview
of it before opening it in a new tab or window, are useful, but not at
all obvious how to use, even if one is aware the feature exists. (On
Linux, activate glance with .) Likewise, Zen's
split-screen mode requires the user to select multiple tabs and then
right-click to select "Split Tab". Rearranging the splits is also not
intuitive. That said, the additional features are compelling if one is
willing to do some searching to figure things out.The Zen interface can be customized extensively to suit individual
tastes via the settings. If those options aren't enough, Zen has its
own set of add-ons and extensions called Mods to modify the interface
or add features. This ranges from a green-hued theme called Matcha to tweaks
to further minimize the sidebar. Most Firefox add-ons should work
with Zen as well, though some may clash with its user-interface
changes.Currently, Zen isn't fully baked enough for me to consider
switching to it. Others may be more adventurous in their
browsing habits than I am, though. I can say that it has stabilized
significantly since I first tried it shortly after its first public
release. The project does bear keeping an eye on, and the Mozilla
folks could do worse than to copy some of the ideas (and code) that
the project is experimenting with.The Firefox fork rabbit hole is surprisingly deep. There are a few
alternatives I chose not to try—but mention here for
completeness—and probably a few that I've missed. The Basilisk project
is a kind of retro-Firefox project that aims to retain technologies that
Firefox has removed. This includes the deprecated Netscape Plugin Application
Programming Interface (NPAPI) plugin support, ALSA support on
Linux, XUL extensions,
and more.The Pale Moon project is
another browser that has forked off of Mozilla Firefox code and no
longer tracks it directly. It uses
the Goanna
fork of the Gecko rendering engine and still supports NPAPI
plugins and XUL extensions. The project promises no telemetry or data
gathering. It offers a somewhat nostalgic look and feel
that is similar to Firefox in the mid-2000s.For those who pine for the days of the Netscape suite that included
the browser, mail client, HTML editor, IRC chat, and more, there is SeaMonkey. The project
uses code from Firefox and Thunderbird, though it is not directly
based on recent versions. According to its site, it backports security
fixes from Firefox and Thunderbird ESRs that apply to SeaMonkey. The
project also maintains the Composer HTML editor and ChatZilla IRC
client that are no longer maintained by Mozilla. SeaMonkey is still
packaged for a number of Linux distributions, and binaries are
available for Linux on x86_64 and x86 as a tarball. It might be a good
option for users who are still using 32-bit x86 Linux systems.Still dependent on MozillaRegardless which Firefox fork one chooses, it is important to
remember the downsides. First and foremost, all of the forks are
dependent on Mozilla to do the heavy lifting. The bulk of development
is carried by Mozilla, the direction of Firefox is set by Mozilla, and
choosing to run a fork puts the user one step removed from security
and bug fixes. This does not mean users shouldn't consider one
of these forks, but they should be aware of the potential
downsides.There is some precedent for soft forks displacing the original
upstream. For example, the Go-oo fork of
OpenOffice.org became LibreOffice after Oracle consumed Sun. That fork
has clearly overtaken OpenOffice.org in the Linux community as the
go-to desktop office suite and its development has eclipsed that of
its counterpart Apache OpenOffice. Go-oo, of course, had corporate
support as well as community support. For a Firefox fork to be truly
independent and sustainable, it would need a similar effort behind
it. Thus far, no such movement has materialized.A recent question on the LibreWolf issue tracker drives that point
home nicely. User "kallisti5" asked if
LibreWolf was prepared to fork Firefox "if Mozilla continues
farther down this path?" One of LibreWolf's contributors, "ohfp",
replied that the project was "absolutely not prepared to do
that" due to limited time and energy to work on the project as it
is. "We would not even remotely be able to fork and maintain a
browser fully, let alone to continually develop and improve
it."Another downside to the forks is that there are far fewer eyes on
their code and communities. When Mozilla makes an important move,
whether it's positive or negative, users are likely to hear about it
quickly. As of now, the forks get relatively little attention.Folks who want to jump ship from Mozilla's ecosystem entirely,
while still sticking to open source, have some options. Ladybird,
which LWN covered in
June last year, is an attempt to create a new browser from whole
cloth. It is an interesting effort, but not ready for day-to-day use
for most folks. Qutebrowser, Nyxt, and NetSurf are also worth a
look—though they may have some drawbacks for day-to-day use in
terms of site compatibility and features. We will take a look at some
of those options soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Live Ransomware Demo: See How Hackers Breach Networks and Demand a Ransom</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/live-ransomware-demo-see-how-hackers.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh259dK-WFCoXwQ5c8qDtAn1mICm9pXOy3tt6q_BpnVivinJx-IAzdqp8Jd4U8c2iSd6syEEAGWiOdD6mjEWJLV2c1npVfCariIxayajn414lBPp1aVpggtjwLpR_iE3Ntoq5lseG_gUmh5JDssQFJCS_2bHGsOO0mW9DXss5nXnC0WLyE19_u_u-S0iFI/s1600/ransomware-malware.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyber threats evolve daily.

I’m sharing how I did it, along with the full source code.To clarify, multiple ransomware variants have been named Akira over the years, and several versions are currently circulating. The variant I encountered has been active from late 2023 to the present (the company was breached this year).There was an earlier version (before mid-2023) that contained a bug, allowing Avast to create a decryptor. However, once this was published, the attackers updated their encryption. I expect they will change their encryption again after I publish this.You can find various Akira malware sample hashes at the following URL:The sample that matches my client’s case is:bcae978c17bcddc0bf6419ae978e3471197801c36f73cff2fc88cecbe3d88d1aIt is listed under the version: . The sample can be found on virus.exchange (just paste the hash to search).Note that the ransom message and the private/public keys will differ.We do this not because it is easy, but because we thought it would be easyI usually decline requests to assist with ransomware cases. However, when my friend showed me this particular case, a quick check made me think it was solvable.From my initial analysis, I observed the following:The ransomware uses the current time (in nanoseconds) as a seed.On my Linux machine, file modification times have nanosecond resolution.They provided a screenshot of a partial log (), showing when the ransomware was executed, with millisecond resolution.Based on this, my initial thought was: “This should be easy—just brute-force it by looking at the file timestamps. How hard can it be?”I’ll explain in more detail, but it turned out to be more complicated than expected:The malware doesn’t rely on a single moment in time but uses , each with . The fist two and last two are related, so we can’t just bruteforce the time one by one. Key generation is complex, involving  for each timestamp. Each file ends up with a unique key.The  only records file modification times with .Not all  have millisecond resolution in their log files, some only log with second-level precision. I am still unsure what configuration file causes this different behaviorThe malware uses  during execution.The file modification time reflects , not when it is opened for writing.The code is written in , which is notoriously difficult to read, but fortunately, it wasn’t obfuscated. The binary is statically linked (a bit harder to analyze), but all strings are in cleartext. The error messages indicate that the  library is used, which made understanding the code much easier.The code to generate random is like this (the actual code is in 0x455f40 in the binary)void generate_random(char *buffer, int size)
{
    uint64_t t = get_current_time_nanosecond();
    char seed[32];
 //in the real code, it uses C++ code to convert int to string
    snprintf(seed, sizeof(seed), "%lld", t);
    struct yarrow256_ctx ctx;
    yarrow256_init(&ctx, 0, NULL);
    yarrow256_seed(&ctx, strlen(seed), seed);
    yarrow256_random(&ctx, size, buffer);   
}

The random generator is implemented in . Here is the relevant code, with unnecessary parts removed. As noted in the comments:The number of iterations when reseeding, P_t in the yarrow paper. Should be chosen so that reseeding takes on the order of 0.1-1 seconds.void

yarrow_iterate(uint8_t *digest)
{
  uint8_t v0[SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE];

      sha256_update(&hash, sizeof(count), count);

      sha256_digest(&hash, SHA256_DIGEST_SIZE, digest);
    }
}
The ransomware calls the random generator four times:generate_random(chacha8_key 32);
generate_random(chacha8_nonce, 16);
generate_random(kcipher2_key, 16);
generate_random(kcipher2_key, 16);
Each  call uses the current nanosecond timestamp as a seed. Therefore, there are  that need to be identified. The ransomware generates different keys for each file.These keys are then saved at the end of the file as a trailer, encrypted with  and padded using .The files are divided into , and a percentage of each block is encrypted. This percentage is defined by the ransomware’s  parameter. For each block:The first  are encrypted using .The remaining bytes are encrypted using ..The following picture shows how a file is split. Note that, for very small files, knowing the Chacha8 key and IV isn’t necessary..After studying various VMware filetypes (I will go deeper into this later), I am convinced that the most important files (flat VMDK and sesparse files) has a fixed header, and I can use that to attack the  encryption.At this point, I didn’t analyze deeper. But I am sure that I can reverse engineer the rest of the algorithms later, specifically:How to split the file into blocksHow is the encryption performed across blocks, does it continue the stream?These details will be important later. However, for now, if we can’t successfully brute-force the timestamps, none of the other steps will matter.The approach is as follows: ( and ).Convert these timestamps into seeds and generate random bytes.Use these bytes as the .Encrypt known plaintext and compare the result with the known ciphertext from the encrypted file.: Determine if brute-forcing is fast enough to be practical.: Known plaintext is required for brute-forcing. Estimate the seed initialization time: We need to know when the encryption seed was initialized, at least with . This knowledge can reduce the brute-force scope to about .The simplest (but inefficient) way is to try all possible timestamp pairs where . The number of possible pairs is calculated as: N×(N−1)/2With , that results in  possible pairs.We need to optimize this. First we need to convert all the nanoseconds in a one-to random values:On my , I estimated a processing speed of 100,000 timestamp to random bytes calculations per second (utilizing all cores).This means it would take about  (under ) to convert all timestamps to seed values.Once converted, these values can be saved for reuse.Later, I optimized the process using a , reducing the conversion time from 3 hours to under 6 minutes.If we have a completely deterministic machine, without any interruption, we can run the malware, measure it, know the exact time between T3 and T4. But unfortunately we don’t have this:The malware uses multiple threads,It runs on a machine that is not idle, the distance between T3 and T4 varies based on the scheduler and how busy the system at that time. The code also calls a lot of C++ libraries, which allocates and deallocates objects and makes the execution time more unpredictable.we need to enumerate t3 (1 billion values for each second)we dont start at t3 + 1, but at t3 + start offset, since we know that seeding the value takes time (at least a million nanosecond on my machine), this is the ““we assume that it will only take a few million nanosecond to until the next code is executed (remember: there can be interruptions because of the CPU scheduler, and there are several millions instructions executed). This is the “” valueWhat we can do is to try to run the exact same code as the malware, collect timing data, and try to find a range that statistically makes sense. Using the same technique that I use on my previous post, instead of recreating the algorithm and running it, I just modified the malware and tested on several local machines that I have. The runtime varies quite a lot between machines.My friend Deny went to the datacenter and did the test on the real hardware that was infected. The result is: the time range varies, and sometimes quite a lot. The normal range of the offset is around 2-4 million nanoseconds (so the offset range is 2 million), but the value varies from 1.5 – 5 million (total offset range is  4.5 million). We still need to enumerate 4.5 quadrillion pairs, but this appears to be doable. If we have a system capable of running 50 million encryptions per second, the process would take a few hundred days. However, with 16 such systems, we could complete it in a few months on a CPU. By renting additional machines, we could speed up the process even further. Later, I optimized this using a GPU, achieving a significant speed improvement.I wasn’t sure about how fast we can do Kicpher2, but a quick comparison with chacha, and some quick benchmarking shows that using CPU ony, I should be able to do at least millions of Kichper operations per second on my machine.As explained before,  if  and  are correct, we will be able to decrypt the  of the file, and it will decrypt to a known plaintext.Next lets check the feasibility of obtaining plaintext from different VMware filesFor each file, we need a plaintext sample: the first 8 bytes of the file for KCipher2 (offset 0) and another 8 bytes starting from offset 65,535 (only for large files). Since each block of KCipher2 is 8 bytes, we should use an 8-byte plaintext. It is possible to use fewer bytes (by using bit masking), but this could increase the risk of false positives.This is a raw disk file. If you’re lucky, this might be the only file you need to recover. However, if snapshots were made (as in this client’s case), the new data would be written to sesparse files.To obtain the first 8 bytes of the flat VMDK, you’ll need to install the same OS that was used on the original VM. There are several variations of bootloaders used by different OS versions.To determine which OS was used, check the corresponding VMX file. It should contain partially readable plaintext, allowing you to inspect the configuration for “guestOS”. You might find something like: guestOS=”ubuntu”. However, ideally, you already have documentation regarding which OS was used for each VM, so you don’t have to rely on this method.For the bytes at position 65,535 (plaintext for Chacha8), it is almost always guaranteed to be zero, since the partition typically starts at a later sector.If you create snapshots for your VM, there will be a SESPARSE file for each snapshots. We can see the file format from the QEMU source code.The file header is , and at position 65,535, it should be 0x0 (at least, that’s what I observed in my analysis).Other files are not critical for restoring a working VM, but for initial testing, understanding the time distribution can be helpful. If there are many small files with the same timestamp, it’s useful to know if they cluster within a specific timestamp range.Here are some common file signatures to identify plaintexts:NVRAM files start with: 4d 52 56 4e 01 00 00 00VMDK files (disk descriptor) start with the string: .VMX files start with: VMware log files have lines starting with the format: Since these files are partially readable, we can often guess the initial timestamp based on the beginning of the file (e.g., the  part of the log).By identifying plaintexts in these files, the next step is to narrow down the timestamp for accurate brute-forcing.Now that we know brute-forcing is feasible and we have both plaintext and ciphertext, the next step is to determine when the encryption occurred for each file (since each file will have different keys).The command used to run the malware is recorded in the shell.log file (including the setting for n, which defines how much of the file should be encrypted).Some ESXi hosts provide millisecond resolution in their logs, while others only offer second-level precision. This log gives us the initial timestamp for when the malware started.For example, if the log shows that the malware started at 10:00:01.500, we can safely ignore the first 500 million nanoseconds when brute-forcing, which helps narrow down the search range.Filesystem timestamp and modification timeUnfortunately, ESXi file systems do not support nanosecond precision.Another challenge is that the file modification time is recorded only when the file is closed. This means the recorded timestamp might not exactly reflect the moment when the encryption process started but rather when it ended.For small files, encryption typically takes only a few milliseconds, so the timestamp will most likely reflect the exact second when the file was encrypted. The next step is to determine the encryption time for larger files, where the process takes longer and the timestamps may be less precise.Multithreaded  EncryptionThe malware uses multithreading, where each file is processed in a new thread, with a pool of workers limited by the number of CPU cores. This has both advantages and disadvantages.If the malware targets a single directory and the number of files is less than the number of CPU cores, the process is straightforward—each file will have a timestamp that is very close to the others. On an ESXi machine, it’s common to have CPUs with a large number of cores (in this case, the server has 64 cores).When checking for timestamps using:find /vmfs/volumes -exec stat {} \;
we should be able to identify small files that were encrypted first. During brute-forcing, we can then check multiple files simultaneously for that specific moment in time.Files processed first will have similar timestamps, but things become more complex for files processed later. For larger files, encryption can take seconds to minutes, and the modification time will reflect when the file was closed, which is significantly later than when the encryption key was actually generated.The malware uses  for traversing directories and files. The iterator in  follows the order returned by , which is the same order observed when using commands like  or .Let’s consider an example where we have 4 CPU cores and 8 files. If the files are tiny (less than 1 KB, such as VMDK descriptor files), their processing is almost instantaneous (within milliseconds). Here’s how the processing might look: each find and process  (, , ), while  finds a  (). All four files are processed . Once  complete, they begin processing the  (, , ). However, these files are  and require . While the other three threads are still working,   finishes processing the large  and starts working on the  (). As a result, the  of  will align with the  of .Now, imagine having hundreds of files—it becomes difficult to determine the exact processing order. However, one consistent observation is that the encryption start time for a file is likely to be the same or very close to the modification time of another file.This is because, once a thread finishes processing and closes a file (thereby recording its modification time), it will immediately start processing the next available file. This creates a sequence where the encryption start time of one file is closely linked to the modification time of the previous file.So given few hundred files and plenty of CPU cores, we may only have a list of a few seconds where the malware will start to generate the random keys. So now we have the final part of the puzzle: we know  the encryption was performed.While reviewing the client’s logs, I noticed some entries mentioning the use of NFS. However, after clarification, it was confirmed that NFS was used only for backups and was not affected. All relevant files were stored on local disks on the server.If a network filesystem had been used, it would have complicated the process. If the network time between systems wasn’t perfectly synchronized, the timestamps might have been inaccurate or unreliable, further complicating the brute-force process.The plan seemed solid, so the next step was to implement the code. I needed to confirm whether the encryption process worked exactly like the malware.To test this, I patched the malware code to make the gettime function return a constant value of 0, ensuring predictable and consistent results during testing.I focused on KCipher2 because not all files use the Chacha8 key, particularly small files. Although KCipher2 is a standard encryption algorithm, it’s not widely known, and I couldn’t find an optimized implementation for it.During experimentation, I noticed that my results didn’t match the standard KCipher2 implementations available online. It turned out that the malware included a slight modification in the initialization vector and the encryption process, specifically involving endian swapping.I’m not an expert in CUDA programming. About 10 years ago, I briefly experimented with it but couldn’t find a practical use case for the company I worked for at the time.To accelerate development, I asked ChatGPT (o1) to port the code to CUDA. The code compiled successfully but produced incorrect results. It turned out that ChatGPT had slightly modified the numbers in the constant tables. After manually correcting these values, the code began to work.Although the implementation ran, I suspected it was suboptimal, but I wasn’t able to get further optimization suggestions from ChatGPT (o1). At that point, I had two options: spend more time optimizing the code or proceed with the predicted offset range and refine the code along the way. I chose to start testing immediately and optimize as needed. Unfortunately, this approach turned out to be a waste of money, as it didn’t yield any successful results.At the start of the project, I only had two RTX 3060 GPUs. One was dedicated to my Windows machine, so I could only use one GPU on my Mini PC (connected externally via Oculink). To improve performance, I decided to purchase an RTX 3090. The price in Thailand was still reasonable compared to the 4090 or higher models.I tested the implementation by reading the key and IV from memory, encrypting zero blocks, and writing the results back to memory. The performance was disappointing, achieving only around 60 million encryptions per second. At this rate, the entire process would take about 10 years, clearly too slow for practical recovery.I performed some manual optimizations by removing unnecessary code to improve performance:Only the first block is needed for brute force, so there was no need to handle additional blocks.The code was simplified to only encrypt blocks of zeroes, reducing unnecessary processing.Since only the first 8 bytes of the result were required, the rest of the output was ignored to minimize computation.After researching CUDA optimizations for AES, I discovered that using shared memory significantly improves performance, contrary to what ChatGPT suggested. Surprisingly, the extra steps involved in copying constant memory data to shared memory were negligible in terms of overhead but resulted in the code running several times faster.Initially, I performed encryption on the GPU and matching on the host (CPU). However, this approach was slow, even when executed in parallel:generate encryption on GPUPerform matching in a new thread and submit the next batch of work to the GPU.I found it much faster to avoid writing to memory altogether. Instead, the matching process is handled directly on the GPU, and no data is written to memory unless a match is found. This approach significantly reduced processing time and improved efficiency.For each t3 and t4 combination, a match can occur for any file that shares the same second-level timestamp (but with different nanoseconds).To improve efficiency, we can attempt to match multiple files simultaneously. However, if there are too many files to match, the process can slow down significantly. Currently, the number of files processed in parallel is hardcoded to 32 to maintain a balance between performance and efficiency.I considered and implemented two ways to do the loop. For every t3 value, we could start a GPU kernel to check all offset ranges. However, this method is inefficient, as it would require launching the kernel a billion times, resulting in significant overhead..Alternatively, we can launch a GPU kernel for each offset. Each kernel would then perform the necessary checks. This approach is much faster because it reduces the number of submissions to just the “offset range”, which is around 2 to 4.5 million jobs.Initially, my approach was to submit a task to the GPU, wait for the result using , and then submit the next batch of work. However, this method proved to be slow.Submit work to the GPU, and if a match is found, simply mark it using a found flag.Only call  to check results every 100 steps. If a match is found, the flag is reset to zero before proceeding.While this method significantly improved performance, there’s a slight possibility that if two offsets are very close (less than 100 steps apart), the code might miss one of them. Although this issue never occurred during my tests, I added an optional mode of loop. In this mode, the program reads a list of  offsets and ensures that nearby offsets are also checked manually to avoid missing any potential matches.I believe that GPU experts could still find ways to further optimize my code. Currently, I’m achieving around 1.5 billion encryptions per second for KCipher2 on my RTX 3090.For testing 1 billion values with a single offset, it takes about 0.7 seconds, including the time to check for matches (with a maximum of 32 matches per batch).Testing 2 million offsets would require approximately 16 days on a single GPU, or just 1 day using 16 GPUs.I also conducted tests using Runpod, and the RTX 4090 turned out to be the ideal option. Although it’s about 60% more expensive than the 3090, it’s also 2.3 times faster.With a 4090, the same process would take around 7 days on a single GPU.Using 16 GPUs, the process could be completed in just over 10 hours.From a cost perspective, the RTX 4090 is an excellent choice for this task due to several factors:Large memory is not required.Floating-point operations are not needed.The RTX 4090 offers a high number of CUDA cores, enhancing processing speed.The rental price for an RTX 4090 is relatively low compared to other high-end GPUs.If the 4090 is unavailable, the 3090 is also a good alternative considering its price-to-performance ratio.Initially, my client considered using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) machines and seeking a discount for a month-long rental. However, this option proved to be extremely expensive (costing tens of thousands of USD).After some research, I found more cost-effective alternatives: Runpod and Vast.ai.To brute force 1 second (1 billion nanosecond), with offset range of 2 million, it  will take 7 days. The cost for a RTX 4090 (at the time of this writing) is 0.69 USD/hour. It will cost around 116 USD to brute force a single second.  Renting 16 GPUs will have the work finished in around 10 hours, same cost, but faster.Brute forcing with the range of 4.5 million (which is the range that we need) costs 261 USD. Depending on the number of encrypted files, you might need to brute force 10 or more seconds. If you have a lot of files to recover, weekly or monthly rent will be cheaper.Note: These costs assume everything is executed perfectly. Any mistakes or the need to repeat processes can significantly increase costs.In total, including all my experiments and tests, I spent around $1,200.Unlike runpod, when using vast.ai, you are renting a machine from some random person brokered by vast.ai. When doing the bruteforce, no sensitive data is sent, so privacy should not be a concern.Using vast AI, the bruteforce cost  can be reduced to half, but this depends on your luck in obtaining the machine. The first few machines that I tested didn’t work (network timeout after around 10 minutes of waiting). I also had problem with pulling docker images from docker.io (I had to select another template from another docker repository).Now that I found the value of t3 and t4, I can try to find the value for t1 and t2. The value of t1 must be less than t3, and the time offset is less than 10 million nanoseconds. This can be found quickly in minutes using a single GPU.Here is the algorithm used to split the file into parts:enc_block_size: for every parts/blocks, this is how many bytes to encrypt. The first 0xFFFFF will be encrypted using KCipher2, and the rest using Chacha8part_size: the size of the blockencrypted_parts: how many blocks to encryptvoid compute_blocks(uint64_t filesize, 
    uint8_t percent,
    uint64_t *enc_block_size,
    uint64_t *part_size,
    uint64_t *encrypted_parts)
{
    int parts = 3;
    if ( percent > 49u )
        parts = 5;
    uint64_t enc_size = filesize * (uint64_t)percent / 100;
    *enc_block_size = enc_size / parts;
    *encrypted_parts = parts - 1;
    *part_size = (filesize - *enc_block_size * (*encrypted_parts)) / parts;  
}
The malware uses the 8 rounds variant of Chacha called chacha8, not Chacha20 as many sites reported.For kcipher2, we will encrypt the first 65535 bytes (yes, not 65536). It means that one byte will remain from the first block, and this needs to be used for the next blockFor cacha20, we just throw away the rest of the encryption stream block when starting a new blockTo recover your files without paying, it is not as straightforward as running a generic decryptor. You will need to:obtain timestamps of your filesobtain ciphertext and plaintext for your filesTo be honest, I originally wrote this code for one-time use, specifically for this particular client. The shared code is filled with experimental logic, quick hacks, and lacks proper testing.I don’t have the motivation to clean it up further, apart from removing some client-specific test cases and comments. It’s functional for the intended purpose.The software I provided includes only the main brute-force and decryption components, intended to be used once you have the necessary timestamps.I don’t have a dedicated system to manage multiple GPUs. Instead, I rely on basic shell scripting and a custom script that sends a Telegram message when a match is found. The code is “good enough for me” and simply “works for me.”In essence, you’ll need a capable system administrator who understands the process and knows how to manage and troubleshoot the system effectively.See README.md in the repository, it also has a sample config file to test that it works. Sample encrypted files and configuration files are also provided.I hope you haven’t touched the files, because all hope of recovery will be gone if the timestamps are unknown. Use  to get the modification timestamp. Use find /vmfs/volumes -exec stat {} \; > /tmp/stats.txt to get the timestamp of everything.The file  can help to figure out the minimum timestamp to use.Obtain the ciphertext, as explained above:For flat-vmdk, you need to extract this from the exact OS that you use (including the exact instalation method, e.g: using BIOS/UEFI)For sesparse file, use the header For other files, see what I wrote aboveYou can always just use an offset range of 1.5-5 million, but this may not be the correct range if your hardware is too fast or too slow. You can measure this by checking out the  folder and  folder on my github repository.The first one only measures time ranges by calling the function directly. The second one is used to encrypt a directory, but it is patched so that it will write down the exact time when the timestamp is used as the seed to .Create config files based on the ciphertext/plaintext and timestamp. You can create/split this manually, or use a script to generate it. My code doesn’t do any error checking, make sure the timestamp is in nanosecond format, make sure all plaintext and ciphertext values are correct.If you want a very quick and easy setup, use runpod or other service. If you want to be cheap, use vast.ai, or run it on your own hardware (~ 1K USD for one RTX 3090, which you can resell later).The first brute force is to find t3 and t4 for Kcipher. ./akira-bruteforce run2 config.jsonAppend GPU index if you have multiple GPUs./akira-bruteforce run2 config.json 1I suggest running it inside tmux, so you will be fine in the event of network disconnect.If we are lucky, output.txt will be generated for each t3/t4 found.This is not necessary for small files, but it is neede for big files. For each offset found, generate a config with the t3 found in the previous step. On my target machine, the distance between t1 and t3 is less than 10 million, and the t1 to t2 is  around 1.5 – 5 million. The brute force should only take around 10 minutes.Note that the decryptor has the percentage hardcoded to 15 percent, so please change this before running the decryptor in case the attacker uses different value.Once we have obtained the t1, t2, t3, and t4, run the decryptor:./decrypt filename.vmdk <t1> <t2> <t3> <t4>The decryption process is not optimized, so it will take a while to decrypt../anti-akira run config.json <gpuindex>As explained above: this may take days, so please make sure:all the config files are goodYou are using the correct GPU indexmake sure everything is runningcheck with nvidia-smi (with runpod, we can also view the GPU status using the web)make a notification system to alert you if output.txt is created/updatedProbably 99.9% of the time when you get a ransomware, it won’t be recoverable without the key. But if you are lucky, sometimes it is possible to find a solution. It took me much longer than I anticipated to solve this, I thought that it would take a week, but it took me almost three weeks until we recover an entire set of VM files.I also would like to add that I found a reddit thread about akira ransomware , I wasn’t sure that the ransomware strain that I have is the same as theirs, and that is the reason why I just continue my own research and to open source it. I hope that my experience and code will be useful for someone else. Everytime I wrote something about ransomware (in my Indonesian blog), many people will ask for ransomware help. Many people can’t even find the ransomware executable (just the encrypted file, which is not useful). Just checking if the ransomware is recoverable or not may take several hours with a lot of efforts (e.g: if the malware is obfuscated/protected). So please don’t ask me to do that for free. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI search engines cite incorrect sources at an alarming 60% rate, study says</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-search-engines-give-incorrect-answers-at-an-alarming-60-rate-study-says/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/dartboard_missed-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 21:16:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new study from Columbia Journalism Review's Tow Center for Digital Journalism finds serious accuracy issues with generative AI models used for news searches.

If successful, it could serve as an alternative to the chokepoint at the Suez Canal in Egypt. Turkey, Qatar and the UAE have all expressed support for the megaproject, but geopolitical tensions in the region are complicated, with some of its neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China being part of their own competing trade routes. Baghdad also has to navigate political instability within its own borders amongst rivalling factions.

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTS5o8uYGpY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cTS5o8uYGpY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Amodei made the provocative remarks during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledging that the idea "sounds crazy.""So this is—this is another one of those topics that’s going to make me sound completely insane," Amodei said during the interview. "I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck."Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's late-2024 hiring of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish "to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future."

For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?” We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&T’s central office in San Francisco, called Room 641A. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—made a copy of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.A photo of the NSA-controlled 'secret room' in the AT&T facility in San Francisco (Credit: Mark Klein)Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator Chris Dodd, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tourMark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013. But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.And the fight is not over. The law, called Section 702, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google’s new robot AI can fold delicate origami, close zipper bags without damage</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apollo_humanoid_robot-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:38:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Google DeepMind announced two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, maybe not always), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a moonshot goal of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its Gemini 2.0 large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>N.T.

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peer-to-peer file transfers in the browser</title><link>https://github.com/kern/filepizza</link><author>keepamovin</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over 400 IPs Exploiting Multiple SSRF Vulnerabilities in Coordinated Cyber Attack</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/over-400-ips-exploiting-multiple-ssrf.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8wt2gOO6tQC7VAbHWRY9h8r1ysrD6Ne7ctN-ghRHGpXdtM6RBsiG4d49AvQ1A2oemjCusruXzhTEAbbNXv095-qG0KiGOLruAFLagWIPEhSDq_mCklU0qfPr6iEa6bg7MERMLjvN4i9ChCwhFHGiW_G22LsWgW70YSzk7F9dngPZAT_HJXpiTXk685daR/s1600/code.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:56:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise is warning of a "coordinated surge" in the exploitation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities spanning multiple platforms.

Both require the attacker to trick a target into mounting a malicious virtual hard disk. CVE-2025-24993 would lead to the possibility of local code execution, while CVE-2025-24991 could cause NTFS to disclose portions of memory.Microsoft credits researchers at  with reporting the zero-day bug labeled CVE-2025-24983, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in older versions of Windows. ESET said the exploit was deployed via the PipeMagic backdoor, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine.ESET’s said the exploit in the wild targets only older versions of Windows OS: Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. Although still used by millions, security support for these products ended more than a year ago, and mainstream support ended years ago. However, ESET notes the vulnerability itself also is present in newer Windows OS versions, including  and the still-supported .Rapid7’s lead software engineer  said  and  onwards are not listed as receiving patches, so are presumably not vulnerable.“It’s not clear why newer Windows products dodged this particular bullet,” Barnett wrote. “The Windows 32 subsystem is still presumably alive and well, since there is no apparent mention of its demise on the Windows client OS deprecated features list.”The zero-day flaw CVE-2025-24984 is another NTFS weakness that can be exploited by inserting a malicious USB drive into a Windows computer. Barnett said Microsoft’s advisory for this bug doesn’t quite join the dots, but successful exploitation appears to mean that portions of heap memory could be improperly dumped into a log file, which could then be combed through by an attacker hungry for privileged information.“A relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 4.6 reflects the practical difficulties of real-world exploitation, but a motivated attacker can sometimes achieve extraordinary results starting from the smallest of toeholds, and Microsoft does rate this vulnerability as important on its own proprietary severity ranking scale,” Barnett said.Another zero-day fixed this month — CVE-2025-24985 — could allow attackers to install malicious code. As with the NTFS bugs, this one requires that the user mount a malicious virtual hard drive.The final zero-day this month is CVE-2025-26633, a weakness in the Microsoft Management Console, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system. Exploiting this flaw requires the target to open a malicious file.This month’s bundle of patch love from Redmond also addresses six other vulnerabilities Microsoft has rated “critical,” meaning that malware or malcontents could exploit them to seize control over vulnerable PCs with no help from users.Barnett observed that this is now the sixth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication.The SANS Internet Storm Center has a useful list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.

An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg News found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stole more than 3,000 files in that intrusion.The indictments highlight how, in some cases, the hackers operated with a surprising degree of autonomy, even choosing targets on their own before selling stolen information to Chinese government clients. The indictment against Yin Kecheng, who was previously sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January for his involvement in the Treasury breach, quotes from his communications with a colleague in which he notes his personal preference for hacking American targets and how he’s seeking to ‘break into a big target,’ which he hoped would allow him to make enough money to buy a car.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2287 - Josh Dubin &amp; J.D.

Image: U.S. Secret Service.On March 7, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against Besciokov and the other alleged co-founder of Garantex, , 40, a Russian national living in the United Arab Emirates.Launched in 2019, Garantex was first sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2022 for receiving hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, including funds used to facilitate hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Since those penalties were levied, Garantex has processed more than $60 billion, according to the blockchain analysis company “Garantex has been used in sanctions evasion by Russian elites, as well as to launder proceeds of crime including ransomware, darknet market trade and thefts attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group,” Elliptic wrote in a blog post. “Garantex has also been implicated in enabling Russian oligarchs to move their wealth out of the country, following the invasion of Ukraine.”The DOJ alleges Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda is allegedly Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.In conjunction with the release of the indictments, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. A “most wanted” notice published by the  states that U.S. authorities separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. Federal investigators say they also froze over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.Besciokov was arrested within the past 24 hours while vacationing with his family in Varkala, a major coastal city in the southwest Indian state of Kerala.

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happy 20th birthday, Y Combinator</title><link>https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1899092996702048709</link><author>btilly</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RubyLLM: A delightful Ruby way to work with AI</title><link>https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm</link><author>ksec</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:40:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ballista Botnet Exploits Unpatched TP-Link Vulnerability, Targets Over 6,000 Devices</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/ballista-botnet-exploits-unpatched-tp.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqB-Ta2yVkMau7nK93NiWr1lVC6nvIDRU4yywdjf1BPScT57QUcDKTbnV0PtIA2ghJBhIH8izkKCwkKf5j1g_rIXNIUG822Gxwf-cE-eOFYNDe6hqZi3V9RoriHMz99cqii68l15COLdWTXCZTsAWZFDRXy687S2yrbeWzy5lP_ZOXWezZtobyNfCf_Ee3/s1600/router-hacking.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unpatched TP-Link Archer routers have become the target of a new botnet campaign dubbed Ballista, according to new findings from the Cato CTRL team.

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker
- Python 3.10+The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to balance paying debt vs. investing</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9vPm615xnY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/a9vPm615xnY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing.

This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

"The main issue is that many PDFs are simply pictures of information, which means you need Optical Character Recognition software to turn those pictures into data, especially when the original is old or includes handwriting."Computational journalism is a field where traditional reporting techniques merge with data analysis, coding, and algorithmic thinking to uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden in large datasets, which makes unlocking that data a particular interest for Willis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steganography Explained: How XWorm Hides Inside Images</title><link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/steganography-explained-how-xworm-hides.html</link><author>The Hacker News</author><category>security</category><enclosure url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjy0ozsGeNUv5eaT9LJuFVvo_AOwQRCBfTfQsGFJ0cbwoLJ8o7fZVH7fzghnzJDK3dFEC8aL_Ao-N_eWlfOGMYKJ2pewUd3LZvyQJCBEeOW7bHVBcUp1useG5L3kKhKhkMA6dPEdooHfmoeDkltklMHlFnQNDfZ0GTv-vCX7NVzoubUW-48JODOlNfpUkff/s1600/xworm.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://thehackernews.com/">The Hacker News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Inside the most innocent-looking image, a breathtaking landscape, or a funny meme, something dangerous could be hiding, waiting for its moment to strike.

When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.At the end, I will reflect on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug wasn’t fixed as of publishing this post, although it since has been); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison reproduced the 10% speedup “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from .Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a Raptor Lake i5-13500 I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds using my  configuration, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos. (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some  tuning flags which work around the regression.I’ve used  as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by /. You can find the complete output files and reports on github.Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.You’ll notice I didn’t benchmark the tail-call interpreter on the older Clang release (what would be ). The tail-call interpreter relies on new compiler features which only landed in Clang 19, meaning we can’t test it on earlier versions. This interaction, I think, is a big reason this story was so confusing, and why it took me so many benchmarks to be  I understood the situation.A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a  statement inside of a  loop, looking something like so:Most compilers will compile the  into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each  block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.It’s long been known that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a , each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.Modern C compilers support taking the address of labels, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the s in the latter code into a  LLVM instruction, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the -based interpreter!Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch  into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, in an old LLVM blog post introducing the new implementation.The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many  instructions can be quite expensive.In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented some limits on tail-duplication pass, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed -based implementation! This bug was first identified by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if you fix it, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the  of the regression.Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from 20% to 100%. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, more recent work finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single  statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):Notice that " is only 2% slower than , even though the base  build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.I haven’t mentioned the  benchmark, which you may notice claims to be  than " It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:Compiles the  into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotosCompiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic  graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, andIs able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatchThose facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the -based interpreter, and have the  do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” -based interpreter, goes ahead and duplicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the  test from earlier:Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the , but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.LLVM pull request 114990 merged shortly after I published this post, and fixes the regression. I was able to benchmark it before merge and confirm it restores the expected performance.For releases before that fix, the PR that caused the regression added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number.I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is  and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.Once you have metrics for  system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there  a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.On software engineering One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.And probably that  situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that  regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were  trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.Our compilers typically only  to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” -based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those  binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on the  attribute, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature.  does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the ; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) [[clang::musttailduplicate]] attribute on the interpreter  loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.I want to close with a call-out of how helpful  was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked  of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (, , , and ) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m  I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.Using , I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence  any given build in my  store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is shockingly concise; here’s a taste:I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required all of about 10 lines of code.That said, not everything was rosy. For one,  is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter.

We human beings sit roughly midway between the sizes of atoms and galaxies, and both must be so perfectly structured for us to exist. It’s called ‘fine-tuning’ and it’s all so breathtakingly precise that it cries out for explanation. To some, fine-tuning leads to God. To others, there are non-supernatural explanations. Both are startling.

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kill your Feeds – Stop letting algorithms dictate what you think</title><link>https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</link><author>tom_usher</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:11:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tom McLeish - Cosmology and Creation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwU_xc3VYZ4</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FwU_xc3VYZ4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Show your support for the show with a Closer To Truth merch purchase: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Feds Link $150M Cyberheist to 2022 LastPass Hacks</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/</link><author>BrianKrebs</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 01:20:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://krebsonsecurity.com/">Krebs on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from security researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service  in 2022.

But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the  and the  agree with the findings of the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023.That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,” reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. “From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims’ online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims’ electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.”“Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1’s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.”Working with dozens of victims, security researchers  and  found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase — the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings — in the “Secure Notes” area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.“The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,” the government wrote. “For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.”Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof — from federal investigators or others — that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.“Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,” LastPass said in a written statement. “To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.”On August 25, 2022, LastPass CEO Karim Toubba told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.Experts say the breach would have given thieves “offline” access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass’s oldest customers. That’s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer “iterations,” which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company’s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.Asked about LastPass’s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.“While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,” Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. “It’s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I’d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and SEAL 911 reported yet another wave of thefts as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.”Monahan said LastPass still hasn’t alerted their customers that their secrets—especially those stored in “Secure Notes”—may be at risk.“Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,” Monahan said. “They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could’ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But  instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI tools are spotting errors in research papers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00648-5</link><author>kgwgk</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:54:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Loyalty Cards</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/03/friday-squid-blogging-squid-loyalty-cards.html</link><author>Bruce Schneier</author><category>security</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:04:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.schneier.com/">Schneier on Security</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly 1 million Windows devices targeted in advanced “malvertising” spree</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/nearly-1-million-windows-devices-targeted-in-advanced-malvertising-spree/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/warning-alert-screen-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 20:23:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly 1 million Windows devices were targeted in recent months by a sophisticated "malvertising" campaign that surreptitiously stole login credentials, cryptocurrency, and other sensitive information from infected machines, Microsoft said.The campaign began in December, when the attackers, who remain unknown, seeded websites with links that downloaded ads from malicious servers. The links led targeted machines through several intermediary sites until finally arriving at repositories on Microsoft-owned GitHub, which hosted a raft of malicious files.The malware was loaded in four stages, each of which acted as a building block for the next. Early stages collected device information, presumably to tailor configurations for the later ones. Later ones disabled malware detection apps and connected to command-and-control servers; affected devices remained infected even after being rebooted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to Surveillance</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/first-porn-now-skin-cream-age-verification-bills-are-out-control</link><author>hn_acker</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 18:34:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HackerNews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Age Verification Laws: A Backdoor to SurveillanceThe Problem with Age Verification: No Solution Is Safeno method of age verification is both privacy-protective and entirely accurate]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is This the Scariest Sound in Space?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqSwTC0UtRI</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rqSwTC0UtRI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 18:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The universe is far from silent.

Is God, if there is a God, a personal, conscious, all-powerful Supreme Being? Some offer radically different concepts of ‘God’, exploring novel ideas of what God may be like. They challenge theism—the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam—with radically new kinds of gods. Is this ‘heresy’? Or enlarging our vision of what the Ultimate can be like?

As the current director of information technology at  and an early hire at , , and , Spikes is also among Musk’s most loyal employees. Here’s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon’s cousin.The profile of Branden Spikes on X.When President Trump took office again in January, he put the world’s richest man — Elon Musk — in charge of the , and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by at least 50 technologists, many of whom have ties to Musk’s companies.DOGE has been enabling the president’s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.In 2012, Spikes launched , a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or “sandboxed” web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk’s profile in Spike’s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.Spikes’s LinkedIn profile says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk’s inner circle of trust.In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.“Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,” Spikes said. “This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.”Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.“I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,” Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. “After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.”Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named  whom he’d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.Branden and Natalia’s names are both on the registration records for the domain name . This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the California Russian Association.Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its “White Nights” charity fundraisers:Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011. The man on the far right is Ivan Y. Podvalov, a board member of the Kremlin-aligned Congress of Russian Americans (CRA). The man in the center is Feodor Yakimoff, director of operations at the Transib Global Sourcing Group, and chairman of the Russian Imperial Charity Balls, which works in concert with the Russian Heritage Foundation.In 2011, the Spikes couple got divorced, and Natalia changed her last name to Haldeman. That is not her maiden name, which appears to be “Libina.” Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk’s cousin. is the son of , who is the brother of Elon Musk’s mother, . Divorce records show Reeve and Natalia officially terminated their marriage in 2007. Reeve Haldeman did not respond to a request for comment.A review of other domain names connected to Natalia Haldeman’s email address show she has registered more than a dozen domains over the years that are tied to the California Russian Association, and an apparently related entity called the Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc.:russianamericans.org

Her name and contact information appears in the registration records for these domains dating back to 2010, and a document published by  show that by 2016 Natalia Haldeman was appointed CEO of the California Russian Foundation.The domain name that bears both Branden’s and Natalia’s names — orangetearoom.com — features photos of Ms. Haldeman at fundraising events for the Russian foundation through 2014. Additional photos of her and many of the same people can be seen through 2023 at another domain she registered in 2010 — russianheritagefoundation.com.A photo from Natalia Haldeman’s Facebook page shows her mother (left) pictured with Maye Musk, Elon Musk’s mother, in 2022.The photo of Branden and Natalia above is from one such event in 2011 (tied to russianwhitenights.org, another Haldeman domain). The person on the right in that image —  — appears in many fundraising event photos published by the foundation over the past decade. Podvalov is a board member of the Congress of Russian Americans (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.Writing for  in 2022, journalist  described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the “large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.”“The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO’s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.“One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,” Fishman wrote. “The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow’s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.”The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com reports that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as Constellation of Humanity.The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of the Russian Orthodox Church. This page indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.A press release from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation donated money to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.A review of the “Partners” listed on the Spikes’ jointly registered domain — orangetearoom.com — shows the organization worked with a marketing company called . Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service , which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.When asked about his ex-wife’s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.“I attended several of Natalia’s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she’s got the best intentions with those,” Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. “There’s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they’re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.”Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom’s side, and Jessie James on his dad’s side.“My family roots are about as American as you can get,” he said. “I’ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon’s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.”Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the “special government employee” Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the “wood chipper,” and who recently wielded an actual chainsaw on stage while referring to it as the “chainsaw for bureaucracy.”“Elon’s intentions are good and you can trust him,” Spikes assured.A special note of thanks for research assistance goes to , an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CMU research shows compression alone may unlock AI puzzle-solving abilities</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/compression_illustration_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:22:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently discovered hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples. Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine-learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities."Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?" ask Isaac Liao, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor, Professor Albert Gu, from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created CompressARC and published the results in a comprehensive post on Liao's website.The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine-learning researcher François Chollet to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills. ARC presents systems with grid-based image puzzles where each provides several examples demonstrating an underlying rule, and the system must infer that rule to apply it to a new example.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
